"This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama.","Agreed, unless it's miraculously over due to this new top-hat, or buzz kill, or whatever procedure, we're only partway into a very long and complex event that will almost certainly involve the President further.","2"
"Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process?","This is a biography cover his entire life.","2"
"Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process?","I would not oppose an addition of an entry based on the oil spill.","2"
"I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''.","Okay, we can clean up a few things.","2"
"The original wording was off base, as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina.","I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''.","2"
"Each incident should be analyzed on its own merits, not on the popularity of a phrase.","I fully agree.","2"
"I understand your frustration but there's nothing that can be done about it.","No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.","2"
"We could say the only ''indigenous non-IE language'', at least for W Europe.","Yes, either of those would be better than 'pre-Indo-European'.","2"
"They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative.","I know I don't actually edit here much but I have been watching this process closely and regardless of where they came from I actually concur with both suggestions, with the caveat that the proposed reorganization may take some effort to dovetail well.","2"
"Contributing here is surely part of the Wikipedia editing process?","Point taken.","2"
"Bush article contains the word ''criticism'' ten times, twice in the lead. This article only uses the word once, in the trifling matter of the Nobel Peace Prize.","I agree with OP.","2"
"(Hmm, though we appear to have mislaid liberation theology, homosexuality and the ordination of women.)","I agree, what happened to mentioning those three topics?","2"
"''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life.","The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence, and I agree that it can be improved.","2"
"How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. In recent years, abuse of minors by representatives of the Catholic church made headlines throughout the world, further tarnishing the church's image.''","I think you have all hit on something with this one.","2"

"It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense.","So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede, even if only a very minimal mention, so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits.","2"
"It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense.","So be it.","2"
"Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it!","(ec) I l do ike the idea of starting that sentence with ''Today, ...'' That does help frame the historical context well, implying current, but perhaps transient, notability.","2"
"The child sex abuse scandal and the abuse of aboriginal people is very significant to the Roman Catholic Church.","Important 'current issues' are important to this article.","2"
"Important 'current issues' are important to this article.","I agree that the article needs more on the Church throughout the world, but in a much broader way than has been proposed here - mission work, for example.","2"
"I agree to a point RE:Duffy; I don't think he needs to be named and the opinion of one historian should not carry undue weight.Nothing wrong with ref 17; shows a variety of sources...you can't write simply from the POV of the church as an institution is always in the right...they screwed the pooch on how they handled the abuse cases as well as the lies they put out whenever a Pope dies.--","Using Duffy as a reference at all should be kept to a minimum.In the Creed section I reverted the order to put the creed first.","2"
"Similarly with the points relevant to indians position as ''children'', this is very vague and gives no law, date or time that can be pinpointed.","I agree with you that we should check the source for the ''children'' comment.","2"
"Current events are like a fast growing hedge in the spring, you have to keep trimming them back so they don't get unruly. Let the new shoots spring up and fill out the bush, cut them when they get too long.","As I mentioned we'll likely have to keep trimming things back periodically to keep it focused.","2"
"Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible.","Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.","2"
"This section should be cut down to two or three sentences at the most. This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama.","Even if it's just a sentence or two under Domestic policy (subject to expansion in the future if he takes more direct action concerning the spill), it should at least be mentioned.","2"
"A more thorough explanation would be appropriate perhaps at Presidency of Barack Obama.","Until then, it is better covered under Presidency of Barack Obama and BP.","2"
"Even if it's just a sentence or two under Domestic policy (subject to expansion in the future if he takes more direct action concerning the spill), it should at least be mentioned.","While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.","2"
"Until then, it is better covered under Presidency of Barack Obama and BP.","I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency, and would applaud consensus to do so.","2"

"Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.","I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all.","2"
"They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative.","Re the creed, I have always believed that removing its explicit presentation would be a good thing if space demands suggested it (as it does here).","2"
"They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative.","I don't think any other religion article breaks ''origins'' away from ''history'' and I don't think they should - the two terms are synonymous, and they should be discussing the same things.","2"

It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life.","The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.","2"
"-(undent) ''pro-life'' is a U.S. political category, not a Catholic one.","And why are we still using the non-Catholic word ''pro-life'' ( consistent life ethic may work better).","2"
"They have no place in the introduction.","Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD.","2"
"They have no place in the introduction.","There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article.","2"
"The article does not address them adequately; especially as an FA article.","Yes, this article plainly needs more of that sort of thing.","2"
"Put two sentences plus a wikilink here in the main article.Regarding the comment that the scandal is a drop in bucket of 2 000 years of Catholic history, there are plenty of good reputable sources that put the scandal in context of the church's history without the the fault of 'recentism'.","I think that the article should have only a few sentences on the sex scandals - that is very recent, whereas the Church's efforts to set up missions have been quite longstanding (think of the Jesuits).","2"
"And the issue is NOT just in the U.S.: andAs it stands now, the Roman Catholic Church article is not neutral.","It is that it is U.S.-centric.","2"
"It is that it is U.S.-centric.","Certainly my impression is that it is not limited to the US.","2"

"Can we please stop the bickering?","Well said, my friend.","2"
"Based on my research and your research, we need to include certain specific facts if we want to tell an accurate story in the article.","There's still important background missing.I will have another look at Kamen today, and possibly make a few tweaks.","2"
"1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions, but I think this will need to be made more clear, since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition.I disagree with the change also, I left a note on Xandars page.","And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we're talking about.","2"
"Wikipedia will never be completely neutral because collectively, editors are biased.--","Wikipedia aims to reflect reliable, secondary sources, which are always biased when it comes to politics.","2"
"It might help if the IP editor actually pointed out where they disagree with the article and place here what they think it should say.","Say specifically what you want to see here, what sources you have and make a coherent argument for why it should be included in his bio.","2"
"Perhaps you would care to suggest a specific addition or alteration.","Say specifically what you want to see here, what sources you have and make a coherent argument for why it should be included in his bio.","2"
"(ec) Your message says ''remove it so that I can despise you more'' :-) Seriously, constructive comments would be more appreciated.","Please, this page is for constructive discussions leading to potential improvements in the article.","2"
"We assert facts here, even fact about opinions, but we do not assert an opinion as fact, which is what an OpEd is.","We don't call it a criticism or a controversy, it is simply an event that happened.","2"
"If you actually read that article, you will find the ''critics'' are non-notable residents of the nowhere-near-the-spill NYC area.","I'd also point out that half of everything these days is being nicknamed ''Obama's Katrina,'' such as the earthquake in Haiti.","2"
"To consider an appropriate inclusion of this sort of opinion, we would need to see a preponderance of mainstream reliable sources talking about it.","The consensus in the news is that it isn't Obama's Katrina yet.","2"
"Those are major issues, and criticism of his positions on those issues is notable.Just off a random google search, something like: Gitmo or Obamacare —Preceding unsigned comment added byThere are two ways to fix the inequality, have no criticisms in any article or have them in both articles.","So to have criticism in one but not the other is just ludicrous.","2"
"Perhaps you would care to suggest a specific addition or alteration.","You keep saying there's all these noteworthy problems that should be included in Obama's page yet you fail to name one.","2"
"Time will tell whether Obama is damaged by the spill.","It is difficult to see circumstances in which this matter will become significant enough to be a notable aspect of Obama's biography, although there are conceivably related articles in which this could be brought up.","2"
"Obviously, Obama has received criticism for a number of his policies and activities in the last year, especially his push for health care legislation, his continuation of Bush's foreign policy, evinced by his decision to send additional troops into the field, and his unwillingness to close Gitmo, another Bush policy he's left unchanged.","I agree with OP.","2"
"Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama's biography, but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not.","Agreed, unless it's miraculously over due to this new top-hat, or buzz kill, or whatever procedure, we're only partway into a very long and complex event that will almost certainly involve the President further.","2"

"For someone complaining about piping links, you don't check them.","I'll admit I did not verify the links' accuracy before trying to fix them.","2"
"It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like, ''Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31, 2010 [45].","While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.","2"
