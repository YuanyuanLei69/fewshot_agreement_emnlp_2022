An important milestone has presently been announced in that the Vatican now concedes that Islam has overtaken it in size according to 2006 figures.,"I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.",2

"Just merging the Topics text up to the lead and promoting its subheadings would also work, as I am not sure what heading would be appropriate; and Idiosyncratic ideas should probably be sorted and merged up, anyway.",That sounds like an intriguingly nice way to simplify the levels we're using.,2
I think something definitely deserves to be there in the lead.,I agree; ending with just landmarks is bland.,2
A double standard is being applied to this article and other articles about Africans.,"I agree. 'Black,' should be a disambiguation entry that notes the word is often used informally to refer to Africans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Australian Aboriginals, and redirects to those articles.",2

"Well, here are my two cents about what to cut (based on what seems out of place for a lead, not based on any numeric target for length): 1) sentence starting ''Previous names'' (none of these are in wide use today), 2) sentence starting ''HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells'' (too much detail for the lead), 3) somehow merge the paragraph starting ''Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS.'' with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections, antiretrovirals, etc (I'm not as sure about how to do this one).",I certainly agree on the previous names; not needed in intro.,2

"(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV.","It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. Viewing Religions as Dangerous.",2

"- Well, I can't speak for Wikiscient, but I assume it's for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly: The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image: this is not death in general, it's the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image, another very specific case of death.",I don't really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier (though again a more ''neutral'' John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better).,2

It's beautiful!!,And yes the new print is so gorgeous!,2
I think it's hardly fair to call her the Queen of RnB in 2007 just on the basis of one article.,In all seriousness I think that possibly a mention that she has been called the R&B queen would be OK but keep it at that.,2
The quote would be more at home in our 'since 1900' section.,"Any failures of mine notwithstanding, I'd be OK with moving the quote there, after the paragraph that mentions Harris and the other New Atheists. It would have the beneficial effect of removing recentism from the Etymology section.",2

The variety of ''Christian'' that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays.,"That's very true, but they haven't tried to take any civil liberties away from Atheists (yet)...",2
Is it okay if I add you?,Yeah!,2
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide?,"I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians.",2

This is a lovely piece of poetry.,great job!,2
I'm pretty sure we're at least close to the same page - it's partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter's father opt out.,"Comes right down to it, I have to agree with you - the opt-out can only work if it doesn't leave the mothers high and dry.",2
We took our country back.,In total agreement!,2

"I would favour wording along the lines of : Broadly speaking atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities (gods), most simply expressed as the position that there are no deities, or the explicit rejection of belief in deities. Atheism contrasts with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. This article explains a range of prominent philosophical and religious positions on atheism, and traces a history of thought on atheism to contemporary debates and factors, including those about morality, social dynamics, and demographics.","Peterstrempel, I really like your suggested substitute.",2

"Good luck, I know you can get everything figured out and put back together, if you put your mind to it.",Very true.,2
"I mean, if you think of ''the Devil'' as ''the personification of evil, or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil'', and sex abuse is evil, and the coverup of evil is evil, and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican, then, well, yes, the Devil is at work inside the Vatican.",''The devil is at work'' may be Churchspeak ''people are doing bad things''.,2

It's irrelevant for the classification of the language.,"A (very) brief note (maybe a single sentence) might be appropriate, but a whole paragraph seems to be overkill on what is, essentially, a forgery (from what I can tell) and not, in the end, relevant to the issue of describing the Basque language.",2
I am OK either way.,"I think the sentence is good the way it is; it shows that the church, while believing itself to be the ''one true church'', also wants to work with others on common goals/for unity.",2
