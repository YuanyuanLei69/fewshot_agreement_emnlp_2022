"The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source. I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact.","The original sources, one of which was Kamen, actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence, (technically, released to the civil authority,) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out.","0"

"Some bishops demonstrably knew about the allegations of misconduct but then reassigned the accused rather than report them to the police immediately.","As I stated to you on my talk page, I am not OK with deleting information about the prevailing psychology saying people could be cured of this behaviour, that many of the deviant priests received counseling before being reassigned, or the statement by John Paul II in response to this information.","0"

"So to have criticism in one but not the other is just ludicrous.","There is a huge difference between the criticism aimed at Obama and the criticism aimed at Bush.","0"
"Virtually all criticism aimed at Obama is foot-stamping hyperbole by political opponents. Virtually all criticism of Bush is based on legitimate complaints about his atrocious Presidency (which included 9/11, Katrina and the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression).","Effectively, he is saying criticism of Bush is legit but not for Obama.

"Also the term ''modern'' is entirely POV too in the ''modern'' day the Church has 1,130,000,000 followers, modern people, who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either.","The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.","0"
"I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise).","''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.","0"

"How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today.

"''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.''

However, I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead.","0"
"Our factual article will actually help disperse misperceptions bred by the popular media if we can just make it NPOV and stick to the actual facts.","(Gosh did I really use the word ''fact'' over five times just now - that is why I need Xandar here - I cant speak English!)Good Granny again!","0"
"Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.","You also continue to be wrong and, as far as I can tell, are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position.","0"
"If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy (and it is not clear to me that it does), I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal, although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church, and much more encyclopedia-worthy, to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum.","Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy.","0"
"On the ''sex scandal'' front I think the article should read as below to give a better WORLD VIEW and completely fair description...''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse, though the figure is very low the sensationalistic United States media which is generally centered to a WASP audience in particular enjoy blowing it out of proportion to present a negative view of Catholicism.","The first part of the first sentence (''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse'') sounds fine.","0"
"Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD.","I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.''

"The child sex abuse scandal and the abuse of aboriginal people is very significant to the Roman Catholic Church.","Yes, this article plainly needs more of that sort of thing.","0"
"I think that the article should have only a few sentences on the sex scandals - that is very recent, whereas the Church's efforts to set up missions have been quite longstanding (think of the Jesuits).","I understand.","0"
"The article states that ''As of 2004, the vast majority of worldwide sex abuse cases have been in the United States'' - would you agree to that?","The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S. is 'investigational bias'.","0"

"For these reasons, I feel that his response to the spill deserves mention.--The section on the oil spill is way too long.","This is a biography cover his entire life. Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible.","0"

"This is a biography cover his entire life.","While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.","0"
"Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama's biography, but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not. This section should be cut down to two or three sentences at the most.","I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''.","0"
"However, your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and/or BP—and it undoubtedly exists—is the Christian Science Monitor (who, I'll hazard a guess, supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened), and I don't really think they're a reliable source.","Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.","0"

"Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD.","What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable: new information should be carefully balanced against old, with due weight accorded to each.''

"I honestly don't think for an institution spanning over 2000 years the ''homosexual intercourse'' thing is important/relevent enough to warrant a mention in the intro.","The homosexuality issue cannot be removed.","0"

"I think the whole paragraph about them should go, possibly replaced by something very simple along the lines of, ''After Vatican II, Mass was permitted to be conducted in vernacular languages; the original Latin Mass can also still be performed.'' Details of differences between the two should probably go in the article about the Mass, since this is just a summary.","I disagree, because it's more than just a difference in language; this change was very destructive to the Church the way it was rolled out...Statues and stained glass windows were smashed...people were threatened with excommuniction for kneeling during the consecration as reently as 2 years ago and there was the lie that the Latin Mass was ''outlawed'' causing several breakaway groups in the Church.","0"
"Also, the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all.","And, a recent report that has audited some US dioceses has found non-compliance of their own prevention abuse guidelines.","0"
