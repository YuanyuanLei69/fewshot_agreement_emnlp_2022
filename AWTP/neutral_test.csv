"Ros, feel free to post a suggested image here on the talk page.","Alienating language is not an effective manner by which to defend the article from POV images.","1"
"''A modern portrayal of Santa Claus'' I added because there isn't a color image of a standard iconic Santa on the entire page.","There are enough free-use images that are okay to use, so long as it doesn't impede the loading of the page by slow connection computers.I don't mind an image gallery further down in addition to what we have now.","1"
"My intent was cleverness, which I clearly fell short of.","I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt (which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit, coney, cunny etc.","1"
