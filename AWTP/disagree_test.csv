"Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym).","But, the finiteness of the speed of light is indeed ''likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation'', namely to the creation of theories about stellar and galactic evolution.",0
"Saying B is a practical effect of A, when B and A are both abstract sciences, seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur.","But nor A, nor B are abstract sciences here.",0
"I think that B qualifies as a ''Practical effect'' of A, or even better as a ''Practical consequence'', or, if you like, as a ''Useful consequence'', or as a ''Useful effect'', or as a ''Useful application''.",I guess this is what happens when you come to a page frequented by science geeks (not an insult: I'm one too). The ability to measure a distant star is considered ''practical'' on the same level as everyday usage of a computer or a GPS.,0
It might be trivial but I think that the sentence ''The manner of death was certified as ''undetermined''.'' needs citation.,"Proganda. Both the commentary, and moral and legal conclusions.",0
"People would have been able to see the real Terri, not the one fabricated by the mass media and government powers that be.","She had massive brain damage and was unable to speak, walk, recognise people, or enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The real Terri? She was long since gone.",0
Proganda.,Propaganda regarding the 'vegetative state' and also the photograph of Teri's brain as irrelevant.,0
I will second that.,"Unfortunately, the motion's ''first'' says he has departed.",0
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory.,Dont lie This Tank was here long before 1992.,0

"As long as you're rewriting what monuments were built for, perhaps you'd like to revive the one about Latvia's freedom monument being built to thank Stalin for liberating the Baltic states.",This is Transnistria not Latvia.,0
I do agree we neeed some photos but the use of photos of the tank and statue of Lenin are propaganda photos to try to associate PMR with communism.,"That is not a photo of the Lenin statue, it's a photo of the Transnistrian parliament, which happens to have a statue of Lenin in front of it.",0
"Take down the statue of Lenin, then.","You are missing the point of my remark, Lenin is not the font of all evil as you appear to imply.",0
"What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture.",Strongly oppose.,0
"However, we are not in the business of weighing the references and pronouncing The Truth®.",We weigh the references and produce an article where the majority and minority are given proportional weight not equal weight. This is still not proportional to the amount of sources.,0
"Waterboarding is torture, the use of torture here is a descriptive term - it explains what it is, and vital for an inclusive description of what waterboarding is.","By showing who says waterboarding is torture, and who says it isn't, we can educate the savvy reader.",0
"What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture.",This proposal is incorrect on policy.,0
"I'm tired of saying exactly that, the problem is with a handful of editors who refuse to accept that that is what is meant by a neutral point of view and continually misrepresent the policy as 'no point of view'.","I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia.",0
"I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia.","It wouldn't be 'adopting a very strict version of neutrality', it would be adopting an incorrect misinterpretation of the policy, one that is specifically outlined as incorrect in the policy.",0
"This is not an issue of undue weight, but if anything of systeic bias (and is this case, of systemic bias in the sources).",It's undue weight because in historical perspective this is just one example.,0
Could we consider using WP:SS to reduce the undue weight given to current US practices (which are only one example of many) once this is unprotected?,I don't see how WP:SS would help.,0
But when we are trying to present a picture of waterboarding as a general practice it does not make sense to have more than half of the article be examples from the last five years about the US military.,It's inevitable that most of this article is going to be about the recent use of waterboarding by the U.S.,0
"But the level of detail in a lot of the article can be reduced--the quotes are too extensive, we don't need to say much about KSM/Abu Zubaida other than that the U.S.","has acknowledged using waterboarding against three suspected terrorists after September 2001: KSM, Abu Zubaida, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.'''' Thats just not true, it does not give any context to those statements.",0
"Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. At the same time we could do the much needed re-write of the US section now the CIA says it has waterboarded.","Look, this article doesn't need to tell the story of how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was interrogated; he's got his own article, where that information can be found. All this article needs to do is note that ''the U.S.",0
This article is not about waterboarding.,"I see. So that's why it discusses the Spanish inquisition, the Algerian war, and the Khmer Rouge?",0
"So that's why it discusses the Spanish inquisition, the Algerian war, and the Khmer Rouge?","Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes.",0
"Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes.",I would reduce the amount of time this article deals with recent US waterboarding by removing the ''Controversy over classification as torture in the United States'' as well as ''As a political issue in confirmation hearings'' and ''As a political issue in 2008 presidential election''.,0
"If this is indeed the case, then the article titled Waterboarding in the 21st Century is, in its title at any rate, misleadingly anachronistic and, contrary to what some of its advocates seek to avoid (i.e. an 'Anglo-American' bias), succeeds in reinforcing, more insidiously because unacknowledged, precisely that.","Rename WB in the 21C whatever you want, just get the recentist stuff about america cut down in this article so this can be the ''article giving the wider view in terms of both history and geography'' that it should be.",0
"Rename WB in the 21C whatever you want, just get the recentist stuff about america cut down in this article so this can be the ''article giving the wider view in terms of both history and geography'' that it should be.",I think not. You continue to miss the point.,0
"the misleadingly anachronistic consequence of the present emphasis, however well intended, and the fact that a clear consensus has yet to be established in favour of what you have already done.","Yes i forked the content when four people said it was OK and no-one had objected, i thought you had got over that?",0
The term waterboarding and the controversy around it revolve around its recent use by the united States government.,Yes the term is recent but as you point out the practice itself is old.,0
"Why isn't there a Gini category which says that United States' Gini is high, beside the Gini number?",That information is included in the infobox.,0
"Taking a quick look around, I notice that some countries list a category, others list a rank, and others list a number only.","They have both category and the actual Gini coefficient next to each other. Bosnia, UK, France, Egypt, Greece, and certainly some more have just the coefficient stated, like the US does, but the vast majority has both (please don't make me calculate percentage :).",0
"I am not saying we should use only one, but the contrary, state both category and coefficient like in the ''Sweden'' article. Of course, this should be done for all of those countries, but we have to start somewhere.","Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''. On exactly what basis do you claim this so-called ''category'' to be a ''fact''?",0
"Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''.","Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low').",0
"Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low'). Are you saying that we cannot even divide by three because it is considered original research and not simple logical deduction?","Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Why not divide by two, or four, or five, or six, or eight?",0
"If we're going to name categories, those names and categories must be based on external sources that meet our verifiability standards. We're not allowed to create category divisions ourselves, understand?","However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc. would not be accepted as the verifiability policy states that 'drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research'.",0
It is evident if a country is positioned in the lowest quarter in the same list in which it is shown to be 39th overall.,But again: on what basis are you choosing to divide into three parts...rather than into two...or rather than into four...or rather than into five...or rather than into...?,0
I suggest to re-phrase to ''The USSR formed the alliance with the UK and the US.''--,"So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct.",0
"So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct.",No.,0
The British (and French) guarantees to Poland stipulated no actions of the former in the case if Poland would be attacked by the power other than Germany.,"Um, Britain and France declared war on Germany as a direct result of their guarantees to Poland, do you not recall the British ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from Poland?",0
"Um, Britain and France declared war on Germany as a direct result of their guarantees to Poland, do you not recall the British ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from Poland?",The guaranty to some country is not an alliance.,0
"Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.--","Paul, this is apparent amateur revisionism is tiresome.",0
"Paul, this is apparent amateur revisionism is tiresome.",What ''amateur revisionism'' are you talking about?,0
I suggest to re-phrase to ''The USSR formed the alliance with the UK and the US.''--,It seems uncontroversial to say that 'The USSR joined the Allies' - the 'Allies' of World War II were a temporary grouping which wasn't centred around formal treaties.,0
Perhaps 'The USSR joined the war against the Axis' might be a better phrasing?,Saying that the USSR joined the war against the Axis is a bit confusing: this implies that it made an active decision to join the war when in fact it was invaded (and taken by surprise) and the USSR only fought the countries which had invaded it.,0
"It wasn't until August 1945 that the USSR declared war on Japan - until this time it had been neutral towards the Japanese, despite them being a member of the Axis.",the USSR actually did join the Allies in a formal way (treaty with Britain etc)--it did not have to do so--note the US did NOT join the Allies in 1917 and Finland (fighting Russia) did not join the Axis.,0
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used.,Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it.,0
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used.,"No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet.",0
[43] Thus what remains to be decided is whether the term terrorism or ''violent incidents'' should be used.,"If we can't use the word terrorism, an opinion I'm sceptical about, then we must use words such as murder. People died here, that is NOT merely a violent incident.",0
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules.,''It was agreed...'' = Using the passive tense to describe a decision without naming who or when is classic propaganda-speak.,0
An official of the PMR calling it terrorism and linking Voronin to al-Qaeda (!) is wholly sufficient to keep the term ''Terrorism.'' —,No.,0
"In my opinion, both the present and proposed texts are unsatisfactory, because they pay undue attention to this pre-WWII event.",I believe both the Spanish Civil War and the bombing of Guernica must be borne in mind to understand causes and roots of WW2.,0
That works.,"Frankly speaking, that proposal opens a Pandora box.",0
"Under the heading ''Spanish Civil War'' and concerning the bombing of Guernica, it is proposed to replace : ''[...]with a propaganda figure of 1,654 people killed widely circulated in the west, leading to charges of ''terror bombing''.[28] In reality the attack was tactical operation against a city with militarily important communications close to the front-line, and modern estimates yield no more than 300 - 400 dead at the high-end.[28][29]'' With : ''[...] with a figure of 1,654 people killed widely circulated in the west, leading to charges of ''terror bombing''.","Yes, Beevor supports those casualty figures, and cites them to two Spanish-language books.",0

"From June 26, 2011; The San Diego Union-Tribune's SignOnSanDiego: Congress, put country first: End oil subsidies by John H.","I haven't commented on most of your references, but this one does not say much of the Tea Party.",0
What about including Republican presidential candidates positions on Energy policy (that have tea party movement backing)?,Why?,0
If we could develop a section that covers the TPM relative to that topic I think that it would be good.,"Certainly appears to be about the TPM, here are some excerpts: And with anti-pork Tea Partiers loose in Washington and deficit cutting in the air, it’s not as politically inconceivable as you might think.",0
There are TP supporters who want to close Guantanamo Bay and overseas bases. We need sources that explain how prevalent these views are and whether TP-supported politicians would act on this.,"I'd assume that there are TP supporters who want to do any number of things. Unless those beliefs are held by a majority, or at least a significant minority, of TPM members then i don't see why we'd include them.",0
We need sources that explain how prevalent these views are and whether TP-supported politicians would act on this.,the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board.,0
the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board. challenging the tp support for reducing the size of military and ending subsides is rather laborious.,"The thing is, the Paul family are outnumbered by TP supporters who don't want to do that.",0
Unless folks have sources this is just a forum discussion and should move to another website.,It's not conversation. It's a fact that the public voices in the TP with an interventionist foreign policy outnumber those who don't.,0
An Rfc is not sufficient because editors either ignore it when it is not favorable to their POV or they quickly take action as soon as they see one comment that could be in anyway interpreted in favor of their POV.,Might be best to find an uninvolved admin to summarize the RFC for us.,0
Might be best to find an uninvolved admin to summarize the RFC for us.,We already have that. Are you going to keep asking uninvolved admins until you get a comment that you can in someway interpret in favor of your POV?,0
We already have that. Are you going to keep asking uninvolved admins until you get a comment that you can in someway interpret in favor of your POV?,Where is this consensus from the previous uninvolved admin.,0
"Unless we move back the Rfc tag (which would be pointless), the RFC is now closed.","Note that the archiving of the RfC was done by a 'bot, and has no official status.",0
"If we go for #5 then we'll move the three non-summary sections (''Theoretical concepts'', ''Characterizations'', ''Marketing'') to the TMT article.",These sections however equally apply to both the TMT and the TMM. Also four external editors supported option 1 while only three supported option 5.,0
"If serious concerns are being expressed around suggestion #5, in particular, if constraints on the best summaries are being proposed, then I propose we even do a complete Rfc on the subject because, if we have to create a consensus around the best summaries within suggestion #5, we must do it right.",That sounds painful. An rfc is a cumbersome way to edit an article; particularly if you want to wait weeks for input by uninvolved editors (who almost by definition have little interest in the topic).,0

Of course Bevel is co-equal to Dr.,"One Randy Kryn recently reverted a change I made almost three weeks ago to restore the name of James Bevel to the following sentence: ''A growing civil rights movement, symbolized and led by African Americans such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Bevel used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination.'' I believe it is obvious that Bevel has no business appearing alongside Parks and King in this context, and I have reverted Kryn's edit.",0
Of course Bevel is co-equal to Dr.,"For the moment, the available sources clearly indicate that historians simply do not consider him a ''first-tier leader of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement'' on or close to par with King.",0
"The major civil rights historians (David Garrow, Taylor Branch, Adam Fairclough) know that this data is accurate, and Garrow even proofread further manuscripts.",I observe again that neither Branch nor Garrow has written anything anywhere that might be understood to express the view that Bevel was even nearly as important as King and/or far more important than any other civil right movement leader besides King.,0

I restored the source and changed the wording to (hopefully) better reflect what it is actually saying.,"I completely agree with your point that the citation does not point to a ''review'' of Canada's ''economic weight in space science...'' BUT IMO the present sentence can readily be construed as such. In brief, the sentence misinforms by giving a tabular ratio undue weight. The cited source does not report a ratio that pertains directly to ''academic institutions'' (sic, this is what WP presently is saying) (this is not the Times Higher Education World University Rankings) but purports to be a tabular ranking of an 'impact factor' (that is being floated by the source as a conceptual surrogate for something like ''average publication quality'') of academic papers in space science ''from'' (sic, the source) Canada. I readily concede that using the term ''institution'' is sort of logical, since it is quite likely (but not confirmed for us) that this was the descriptor in the database, but from a WP point of view, ''institution'' isn't what the source says, and while we are probably right, we don't know (at least not from this source as written). The source uses a vague term, ''from'' and that's what we can cite (if the source in all it's considered aspects is adjudicated as providing material of encyclopedic character, and not of undue weight.) IMO we could arrive at... '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters collated data in a proprietary index of academic papers from 1999 to 2009; those from Canada ranked third in impact... ...'' The cited source does not itself purport to look at ''research'' papers only (sic, this is what WP presently is saying, and by saying it, WP implies that was all that was indexed, and that's not what the source says), but at a composite of ''...only journal articles (original research reports and review articles) indexed by Thomson Reuters...'' So correcting that point, and simplifying a little (by losing excessive words), and using the source itself, we get something like, '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters, collating data from 1999 to 2009, ranked Canada as having the third highest national average of citations per academic space science paper...'' or simpler, we have ''Canada has the third highest number of citations per academic space science paper...'''' ...

"No, it isn't clear and it isn't unambiguous. A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and the challenge to Wolf is to explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. Remember, the physics doesn't change for a choice of coordinate systems, nor does it change for a choice of a set of coordinate systems (i.e., a frame). Fictitious forces are fictitious. So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other?","You confuse the mathematical term ''coordinate system'' with the physical application of this mathematical construction in which a coordinate system is applied to describe physical events in a frame of reference. For this application of the mathematical construct, the coordinates are given physical interpretations in terms of space and time. For this application, a Cartesian coordinate system is not essential of course, and many other types of coordinate system are employed depending on how they simplify the problem. For example, an arc-length coordinate system might be used, or a polar coordinate system. I'm sure you know this - you're simply playing games here.",0

And here is the rub: there are two usages of ''fictitious force''. In the approach of Stommel and Moore, in a inertial frame there are fictitious forces if (and only if) you use curvilinear coordinates. On the other hand, in a non-inertial frame there are ''additional'' fictitious forces due to acceleration of the frame relative to an inertial frame. The quotations I have provided (with links where you can read the entire discussion surrounding these quotes) provide their discussion for the case of polar coordinates.

Right up until the outbreak of the Second World War, it was not certain that the Dominions could take any independent stance on the declaration of war or neutrality. In this one vital aspect the unity of the British Empire lingered on, and it was based for the most part on the doctrine of the indivisible Imperial Crown; it was felt that anything less than the unity of the Empire would mean that the King could be advised to declare war on himself with respect to another of his territories. It was not at all certain that Britain had lost its unique right to advise the King on matters of war and peace for the whole Empire.''[4] That's a very important ambiguity and why Canada's independent declaration of war in 1939 represents another step in the long process to independence.",0
