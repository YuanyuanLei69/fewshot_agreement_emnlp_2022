"As phenomena on Earth clearly do work (which requires energy), a part of the energy is not lost into space but rather does work on Earth.","On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths).","0"

"As a speaker of Hiberno-English I can assure you the term British Isles is a common term for these islands.","Where is your evidence that this term ''British Isles'' is used in Hiberno-English? (minus Ulster English; even then, the Irish nationals who speak Ulster English would be even more inclined never to use the term due to the political situation in the North.) From my experience, I know no one who would use the term to refer to Ireland and Britain. To associate the term British with Ireland is largely unheard of in Ireland. It baffles me that you use it. How about you give ME evidence to prove otherwise?","0"
"If ''the'' ''consensus definition'' does not include the actual position of those who it purports to describe, then it's a worthless false consensus.","It doesn't purport to describe people who call themselves atheists, it describes people who are atheists.

"I am arguing that historians of capitalism would disagree with you: you can have capitalism without ''free'' markets, because ''free markets'' have never existed.

"It is a complicated topic. Anyone who admits how complex it is, will, I think, ind out current introduction pretty reasonable and not overly long.","It's not that complicated. The definition is rather simple: an economic system where production is primarily directed by the owners of capital. That's all there is to it. The rest follows from there.","0"
"I read this section on the reasoning for not creating a ''personal life'' section and still don't see why a personal life section has not been created.","Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability.","0"
"Emphasizing private ownership of capital is hardly glorifying; indeed, it is Marx's number one point.","As for private property, I disagree with Marx, changing which entity legally owns the means of production does not necessarily change the underlying mode of production. The PRC's or Singapore's large state sectors are evidence enough of this, although they are publicly owned, they still operate for a profit and often reinvest this profit into the economy, the wage-system (which Marx considered to be a defining feature of capitalism) still remains in place as workers are still exploited in the Marxian sense (China is described as capitalist or state capitalist by non-socialist and non-Marxist commentators and political scientists).","0"
"(and where exactly - outside of the Ottoman Empire - were they allegedly deported to?) IMO (based on review of the scholarly/historical analysis) the word/term ''deportation'' is in fact a catch phrase of genocide deniers who attempt to minimize what actually occured - as there was no deportation (but instead what occured was uprooting [mass ethnic cleansing - if you will] of the native population and forced starvation and massacre through direct and indirect means - ie.","I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)?","0"

"Consider bread production in the U.S. That's a free market. The government doesn't tell the producers how much to produce and what to charge. In other words, it's ''unregulated.'' The government doesn't regulation production and consumption. That is, bread market is a free market. There is no such thing as a capitalist system where there are no free markets. The distinguishing characteristic is free markets.","Take an authorative historian of capitalism and you'll see that capitalism most certainly exists without free markets. Even your bread market is regulated for food safety, quality control, price subsidies to farmers and so on - far from ''free''. But let's say that even if a free market could exist, it doesn't mean that we should make the definition of capitalism so narrow that it excludes cases where markets are regulated or ''interfered in'' by the state.","0"

"Weren't the Mahayana texts created by the Mahāsāṃghika, which is THE oldest vinaya of Buddhism and the ''default'' vinaya of Buddhism, while Theravada is some side branch of some people who split off from the Mahāsāṃghika.","''oldest branch'' is a very unclear phrase in this context. When talking about human genetic or linguistic history, ''oldest branch'' would refer to the group that split off earliest from the mainstream population; for example, we can talk about the Anatolian languages are the oldest branch of Indo-European because they have both innovations and archaic features that are not shared by any other attested Indo-European languages. However, that's different than what most people are likely to think it would mean: actually, all branches of Indo-European or of Buddhism are equally old, because they all go back to the same source (otherwise, it would be a mistake to think of them as branches).","0"

"The problem with your version is it leaves out mention of persecution of Catholics, and many other factors.","By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.","0"
"I am not sure what would be the best word - however ethnic cleansing (though not my favorite phrase) perhaps describes the intent of the actions and uprooting (from homes/villages etc) also somewhat describes at least the portion regarding the removal of persons and forced (death) marches pretty much describes what occured from there on out.","''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide?","0"

"It's ''pray against it, search your soul for what you have done and how to change, and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay.''

"Within that context, general curvilinear coordinates are the most comprehensive, and when the discussion is framed in those terms, the entire subject becomes unified, and one sees that what had seemed to be distinct concepts are really just different ways of looking at exactly the same thing.","I'd agree that ''just the same thing'' can be described in various coordinate systems. However, the fictitious forces and the classification of the various contributions as ''centrifugal'', ''Coriolis'', or ''Euler'' depends strongly upon the observer's state of motion (e.g. are they rotating? and about what axis, oriented how?) and not upon their selection of coordinates (Cartesian, arc-length, etc.) to describe what they see.","0"
"The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world.","My data seem to disagree with that - see, for example, here, page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th, and that's counting the Gaza city area, not the entire strip, yielding a much higher density of 16,450/km2.","0"

"Retrieved 15 December 2011.  Discussion Which puts Encyclopædia Britannica Concise at odds with the Encyclopædia Britannica that you were quoting on December 4, which goes on to say: Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons...","They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes.","0"
