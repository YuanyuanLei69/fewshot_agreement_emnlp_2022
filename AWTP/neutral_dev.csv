"I'm not so keen on: Suggested re-wording: Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism, and controversy over its prohibition of abortion, contraception and euthanasia.","I'm also concerned that the reason the Church opposed some forms of contraception isn't because condoms kill babies, but because of their view on sex and marriage.-","1"
"How about: ''Over the centuries, the church has engaged controversies of many kinds.","There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe, and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC, so it's not necessarily a new thing either.","1"
"You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight, which exactly clarifies the point that I am making: ''An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject.","Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.''

"Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.","It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought.","1"
"It is certainly not for the introduction sefction to the church.I am sorry, you are NOT deciding what goes in the lead of the Catholic Church article.","And why are we still using the non-Catholic word ''pro-life'' ( consistent life ethic may work better).","1"
"and another 5% to issues in Canada.","Always best to do that, I think.","1"

"Do the two different forms of mass need to be discussed in detail in this article?","I think everyone is trying to build a good article in good faith.","1"
"Please note that the article does not in any way assign blame to BP, something that is beyond the scope here.","I gave an example text above which eschews the blame game and other details best explored elsewhere, although I conceded at the time that it was only an initial draft.","1"
"When all is said and done the event might be worth a section this long, or maybe shorter, and we will have to make room for the rest of the story as it arises.","But if someone wants to remove aspects of this, I have a hard time imagining it will be as responsible a representation of what is left, and I'd like to see these points addressed, not just undertaken.","1"
"Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.","Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.","1"
"It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP's failure to stop this early, as their plan suggested they could and would; yet at the same time, it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil, considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month.","You seem to be saying that we should have a link to what a drilling rig is.","1"
"If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for.","And, while BP was 65% owner of the field, and so of the oil gushing from that field, the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals, and the investigations are looking into their actions, inactions and histories as much as BP's.","1"
"CNN has an article about Obama personally promising to triple the cleanup manpower [43].","Thanks.","1"
"The reader doesn't need any more than by way of introduction, before reading about what this has to do with Obama, in order to understand Obama's life and times in 80,000 characters or less."," ;)","1"
"On May 28, 2010, Obama said ''I take responsibility.","We could fight any mention of the spill, or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world, and err on the side of making this section, you know, bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care (both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated).","1"
"If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press.","And they are based on public perception, not legal conclusions or proven facts.","1"
"It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly.","Thanks.","1"
"In theory, a good idea.","—Preceding unsigned comment added by","1"
"--","I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''.","1"
"For example, Gerald Ford had a dog is not clear.","Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.","1"
"I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous.","I hope it can be confined to large-scale water-borne disasters in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'm afraid from now on out, every time there is any lingering problem that a government leader cannot quickly fix they'll call it X's Katrina.","1"
"We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina.","I'm not an apologist for BP, who should pay every penny they owe and then some, and may well do so, but I am trying to use the record to correct the recounting of the way the newsiness has unfolded, or the abbreviated version of such, neither of which is remotely encyclopedic.","1"
"We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina.","Gerald Ford had a dog, Liberty is better.","1"
"There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article.","Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings, and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout.","1"
"I fully agree.","Obama's role, and the public's expectations of his administration, revolve mostly around BP so far, not Haliburton or Transocean.","1"
"If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for.","Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.","1"
"I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all.","As to your point about piping, I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic.","1"
"I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous.","Until and unless one of the abovementioned things, or some other major detail, arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end, I really don't see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers.","1"
"I would suggest something more like this: Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident.","Okay, I've made some minor cleanups and corrections.","1"
"I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead.","-","1"
"If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press.","What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean (allegedly faultily, with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks, indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton (allegedly shoddily; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year).","1"
"IMO that part is fine as it is.","The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs.","1"
"-I agree that the full Nicene Creed should stay.","Could she clarify those?; perhaps there is indeed more merit to those suggestions than I can currently see.","1"
"It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page.","I think readers who are unfamiliar with the RCC or other Christian religions which use the Nicene Creed won't necessarily understand what it is saying.","1"
"Also, eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes.","Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence.","1"
"Re the moves, I understand that this really is an editorial decision, but one that does have other implications, as you allude to (although ones I did not understand; see below).","It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations, something that I think we all agree should be avoided, whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest.","1"
"The section is probably too long, as I have already said.","If one were asked to write about a poem, one wouldn't just re-print the entire poem ...with the implication of 'read it for yourself, it is so obvious.' Almost all Christendom ascribes to the creed.","1"
"Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues.","While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown, there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV.","1"
"I could go either way; I just want it to be accurate and grammatical.I've made some small changes to the lead wording for improvement of flow.","The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead.","1"
"I will put the figure in when I get it.","Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession, whether it be a doctor, dentist, store worker, gym instructor, etc...","1"
"if people are that interested in it, they will find a link in the article.","I know y'all will be unhappy, but these changes won't fly.","1"
"Karnacs, many people may ''know'' about scandals in the Catholic church, but rather than distorting historical perspective, something like Summorum Pontificum is a much bigger current event as far as the Catholic church is concerned.","I'm still trying to be very patient and nice, but good granny, if you don't read the policies/essays/etc., don't quote 'em.","1"
"I fixed the fragment, but if you want to word it better, go right ahead.--","This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals.","1"
"This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals.","The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue, although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out.","1"
"(Gosh did I really use the word ''fact'' over five times just now - that is why I need Xandar here - I cant speak English!)Good Granny again!","On the ''sex scandal'' front I think the article should read as below to give a better WORLD VIEW and completely fair description...''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse, though the figure is very low the sensationalistic United States media which is generally centered to a WASP audience in particular enjoy blowing it out of proportion to present a negative view of Catholicism.","1"
