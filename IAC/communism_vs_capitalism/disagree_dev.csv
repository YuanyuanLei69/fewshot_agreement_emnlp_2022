The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men. When the USA first had the vote, Europe still had kings and emperors.","The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote. They didn't want mob rule and chaos. ""Most of the Founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote. 'Property', in those days, also included slaves, of course, and half of the Founders were slave owners....The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote. In 1787, there were about four million people living in the 13 original states. But only about four percent of them, it is estimated, could vote. Excluded were the one million slaves, the two million women, anyone under the age of 21, and all non-property owners.""

 oh no!! broker has threatened to stop loving this country if we help the poor!! we better go back to capitalism!!","You will never help the poor with a socialist system. The first casuality of a socialist state is the spirit of charity. The concept of charity in European societies does not exist, because it is the government job to the help the poor.
 
 Government officials just don't strike me as being natural care givers. What then happens is you get a token ""official"" who pretends to give a rats pututie for carring about the poor, to make all the heartless people in a socialist state feel good that the government is doing something.",-1,0
"1411","That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer.","Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?",-2,0

"5134","I wouldn't like to credit an economy-wide change with benevolence. Were it a sacrifice avoid employing children, children-employers would have a competitive advantage. Yet they virtually died out in every developed market before any law was passed.","Source? Children were regularly employed in the UK well into the 19th Century, and laws restricting child labour were passed as early as 1802.",-1.57142857143,0

We saved European governments in WW2. The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men. When the USA first had the vote, Europe still had kings and emperors. Europe has become more like the USA and needs to work harder to become more like the USA. The USA had true freedom for more than 100 years before Europe started to get rid of their kings. In a few European countries they still have thier kings. I do not want to see a return of kings the the USA. Europe is almost like the USA, they just need to try a little harder.",-4.16666666667,0
