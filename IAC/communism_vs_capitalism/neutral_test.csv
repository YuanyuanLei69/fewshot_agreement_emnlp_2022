 can you please respond to FDR and his New Deal that saved the country?","Look at the DJIA. In the early 30s the economy was starting to turn around. Was it the New Deal? I'm willing to accept that. But the economy was about as low as it could go and could go no where else but up. In the years just before WW2 it looked like the economy was about it take another dump. Saying the New Deal saved the country does have some merit, but it is shaky at best. I can say for sure the economic explosion after WW2 was due to massive defense spending.",-0.333333333333,1
"1771","Take for example Judge Learned Hand's indictment of ALCOA. What 'crimes' was ALCOA punished for? To quote Hand:
 ""It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every new- comer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel."" [Alan Greenspan, ""Antitrust"" published in Ayn Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal] 
 In other words ALCOA was being punished for being too good a company, too competent in its management, in other words Alcoa's crime is that it is too competitive.","And would not being 'too competitive' lead to a monopoly? (if not for govenment action)",0.4,1
"1907","Okemoticon_confused, this doesn't address my point which is that none of the current bills in congress lower the costs of health care or anyone.","Well, you know what happens when they try to eliminate waste. The opponents start screaming that the government is ""rationing"" health care.
 
 In any case the inclusion of the 40 million uninsured wil be financed mostly by waste elimination. At least it is a start. The status quo is untenable. 
 
 The essential point here is that the universal healthcare systems in Europe, Japan and Canada deliver MORE healthcare for less money. It is not the case that in Canada, healtcare is in short supply because the government is rationing it. They are ahead of us in all metrics except waiting time for non-essential surgery. One example is the waiting time in emergency rooms as some of us have actually experienced. We may not be able to achieve the same efficiency overnight but we have to stop putting our head in the sand.",0.571428571429,1
"1357","Fortunately, the Bolshevik Revolution failed. 1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.
 
 Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.","Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war. The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice, around the time of the world wars. The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine, which forced the Soviets to do the same. I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.
 
 The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan.",-0.571428571429,1
