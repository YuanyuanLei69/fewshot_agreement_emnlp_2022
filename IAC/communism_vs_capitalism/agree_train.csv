Will the United States one day become a socialist nation? Does socialism work? Would avoiding socialism hurt the future of the US or would socialism hurt the future of the US?","Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.",2

In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system.",2

Under a regime where identification papers must be presented on demand, anyone who for whatever reason does not have those papers on them becomes suspect, liable to be rounded up and imprisoned.",2
