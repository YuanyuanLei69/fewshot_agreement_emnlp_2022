"3796","People do not like to be cheated. They do not like to be victims of fraud. If economic systems are not governed and regulated, people can be victimized by the systems.","And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality.",0
"3091","Communism meaning the government russia had from the 1940s to 1990. Democratic- republic: the government the US has today.","Well, in that case I would go for the US government any day. Soviet russia was so far removed from the communist ideals of equality as contemporary Russia. Power, wealth and influence was concentrated in a precious elite... In fact, it`s probably the same elite that rules Russia today. I can`t think of any Soviet benefits over US-style democracy, apart from the societ educational system (but that`s not even entirely a political issue).",0
"7218","You mean what you got was an eye opening shocker into the world of leftist propaganda, and I can see that like a good sheeple you swallowed it hook line and sinker. Thankfully though, most people chose not to submit themselves to his brand of commentary and stayed away from the drivel you will so easily endorse because the movie tanked. Didn't you notice how empty it was in there for an opening weekend?","Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.",0
"3312","I agree. People complain about imports but then buy them. People complain about the little toys in Wal-Mart being made by cheap labor while they drive their imported cars. What a bunch of hypocrites. Don't they realize that their ONE car is about as valuable as the whole toy department (or close to it). Many of these same people have a Toyota and Honda in the garage and complain about jobs going overseas.","Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants.",0
"2412","The healtcare reform addresses these issues. What you are writing is pure demagogy.","Really? I never know why people can't objectively look at things. Where would this reduce ANY health care costs? From every study I've seen it will cost Americans more",0
"7427","You missed the whole point of my story. I was not disgusted at the poor people I was disgusted at the government under a socialist mindset. I love poor people, heck I was one for a while (and really kinda still am).","Oh, you have a problem with Socialism? Is that so?",0
"8573","What is your point?","Possibly that the US was not supposed to be, and is not a democracy? In any case, the rulers were not ""common"", neither were the people ""free"".",0
"5355","Dae,
 
 I hear you and have said many times that I'm not a Laissez Faire type guy. My point was that the ability to accumulate capital (personal property) is the reason that the US is the country it is today. Sure there's a place for the govt. in ANY system, including this one. However, the reason our country has done so well, for so long and the reason we're so productive as workers is the fact that we have a right to participate in the system and accumulate wealth. 
 
 Yes, the govt. will be needed to provide certain services. Yes, it is necessary to have rules, taxes, and a govt. to provide security and facilitate trade and etc... I've never said any different. However, there's a difference between saying that and saying that everything good has come through the govt. That's not true and if it was the USSR (or Germany) would rule the world today. The private sector is what drives the govt. and the economy. Without the Private Sector, there wouldn't be any govt. or tax money or tax payers to fund all the wonderful things that the govt. does. But too much govt. and the private sector whithers and with it, the govt. as well.","I think you undervalue the combination of poor immigrants and vast untapped natural resources as it pertains to our success.",0
"6552","If I get the government to steal your pig, give it to me, and then I throw pig droppings at you all year and then keep all the pork, that is fascist economic theory. 
 
 See the difference???","I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands.",0

 i'm sure every old person from the time of FDR to the present was very pleased to receive their social security check when they turned 66 years old. if we dont continue running on a deficit, then our generation will receive a check too. and who knows, you might really really NEED it. many old people use it to help pay for their prescriptions. its easy to condemn social security when you're young, but just you wait until retirement age.","When FDR started social security he was betting that most americans would not be around to collect. The average life span at the time was below 66 years. Since then americans have been insulting the state and disrupting it's plans by not dying young enough.",0
