 i'm not a big fan of massive defense spending, but it is government spending nonetheless. therefore, if you say that ww2 stopped the depression, then you are also saying that government spending can take us out of an economic slump. same thing applies if you think it was the New Deal","That is exactly what I am saying. By no means do I condone big government saving the economy by any means, defense spending or anything resembling a modern New Deal.
 
 What may suprise you here is that I am afraid of people with guns! Especially a large well equiped military. A large well equiped military can have politcal power unto itself. It is a large credit to our professional officer corps that we don't have a miitary coup every few years.
 
 I just wish the rest of our government had the same discipline. Then I could entertain the idea of socialism. When the state has political power, it never gives it back. Before I get flamed, I am not advocating a military junta as form of government for the United States.",1

"5735","Hindus in U.S. Exemplify Capitalism's Basic Virtue
 Francis Fukuyama's formulation of the fundamental criteria of citizenship in European nations -- ""blood, soil and ancient shared memory"" -- captures perfectly the fatal flaw at the heart of European multiculturalism, and reveals the hypocrisy of the European contempt for the American experience (""A Year of Living Dangerously,"" editorial page, Nov. 2). Critically, what is missing from that formulation, and from Prof. Fukuyama's prescription for cure, is the role of capitalism, and the worship of the almighty dollar.
 
 As Hayek and his disciples have pointed out, capitalism is the most democratic and virtuous of social systems: dollars are not black, white or red. And a society that accords social and cultural respect to those who succeed in the economic sphere is, by definition, more inclusive than one based on any other set of criteria.
 
 Let's take a really (one would think) remote cultural group in America: Hindus. Something like 40% of hotel/motel properties in America are owned by Patels and their cousins. And they contribute to American society at every level: philanthropic, cultural and social -- because of the respect they are accorded for their economic success. One generation: from immigrant to university donor and honoree.
 
 But societies that place economic success well below ""blood, soil and ancient shared memory"" in their pantheon of virtues are fated to spend eternity trying to square the circle: integrating those who do not share in those historical criteria, and never will.
 
 Barry Augenbraun -- St. Petersburg, Fla.","Actually, one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world, South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world.
 
 Do all of these groups hold values in common? Or, is there a distinct brand of Hindu capitalism as opposed to Chinese capitalism as opposed to South Korean capitalism? And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.
 
 I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though.",1
"7414","The argument that child labour is necessary in some economies is a strawman, it was used when the unions here forced the changes in working conditions through.","Unions fought to keep children out of work for the same reason they fought to keep blacks and women out of work - they want a monopoly on employment.",1
"3979","It's not. Education, from K-12 and higher is incredibly expensive. Most private schools and universities live on the donations of their alumni. My private highschool was short $2,000 after tuition. $60 million short every year.","Well, your thinking with a given market of a few. Public school is monopoly, and the price is way out of line according to the real demand. I'm quite sure that it would adjust accordingly...hell, if one could afford a computer, then one can afford an education via online.",1
