"2324","Steeeeve, ALABAMA voted out ""miscegenation"" in 2000 ""by act of legislature"".
 http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/al/main03.htm
 Loving v Virginia ruled Alabama's law as unconstitutional over 30 years prior.
 
 The truth is that when the court notes that a law is unconstitutional, the law becomes unenforceable.
 The COURT does not remove the law from the books. 
 The legislature must accomplish that act by its actions.
 
 But the action of the court, invalidating the law, PRECEDES the action of the legislature...
 
 I am asking about states where the legislature, without having the courts already striking down the law, took it upon themselves to remove the miscegenation law all by themselves.
 That is the point.","And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature. 
 
 Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
 
 It doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action.

"7584","For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.
 
 But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.
 
 We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their ""lifestyle.""
 
 There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy. We feel deeply threatened, for we sense that we are losing the battle. Not simply the battle against homosexuals, but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as ""Christian America.""
 
 At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate. No more. The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society. And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall, we have become politically desperate, and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists.","The other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible",1

"2964","South Africa's highest court has ruled in favour of same-sex marriages, which are banned under current legislation. 
 
 The Constitutional Court ordered that parliament amend marriage laws to allow gay weddings within a year. 
 
 The constitution outlaws discrimination against gays and lesbians, but social attitudes remain more conservative. 
 
 The court ordered that the definition of marriage be changed from a ""union between a man and a woman"" to a ""union between two persons"". 
 
 Last year, the Supreme Court of Appeal had ruled in a case brought by a lesbian couple that the current law discriminated against homosexuals. 
 
 But the home affairs department went to the Constitutional Court, arguing that only parliament could change the law. 
 
 ""The common law definition of marriage is declared to be inconsistent with the constitution and invalid to the extent that it does not permit same-sex couples to enjoy the status and benefits it accords heterosexual couples,"" said Justice Albie Sachs in his ruling, AFP reports. 
 
 After the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled last November that Marie Fourie and Cecilia Bonthuys should be allowed to wed, they later found they were unable to register for a church wedding at the Department of Home Affairs. 
 
 Keketso Maema, a lawyer for the Lesbian and Gay Equality project, said he was disappointed that the Constitutional Court did not order the immediate legalisation of gay marriages. 
 
 ""It's a bit disappointing. It feels like it's one step forward and still another one step backwards,"" he told Reuters news agency. 
 
 Church groups in South Africa have argued that the issue should be put to a referendum, and say that most South Africans would oppose the legalisation of gay marriages.

I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in ""sinister"", but in the sense of ""abnormal"") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.","Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as ""deviant"" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be ""tolerated"", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.
 
 You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.
 
 Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.
 
 Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the ""benefit"" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.
 
 Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity.",1

 Also, TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) -- New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that same-sex couples are entitled to the same rights as heterosexual couples.
 
 But the court left it to the Legislature to determine whether the state will honor gay marriage or some other form of civil union.
 
 Advocates on both sides of the issue believed the state posed the best chance for gay marriage to win approval since Massachusetts became the only state to do so in 2003 because the New Jersey Supreme Court has a history of extending civil rights protections.
 
 Instead, the high court stopped short of fully approving gay marriage and gave lawmakers 180 days to rewrite marriage laws to either include gay couples or create new civil unions. (Opinion -- pdfexternal link)

"6993","Early Christian authorities rejected marriage, for the very reason that it was Goddess-oriented, and also on grounds of eschatology. Since they believed that the world was going to end at any moment, according to Jesus' promise, they saw no point in continuing another generation--for their savior specifically stated that the world would end in his own generation (Luke 9:27). However, as the decades wore on and the world did not end, fathers of the church turned even more firmly against marriage because they thought universal virginity was needed to bring about the promised kingdom of Christ. 
 
 St. Jerome said the purpose of every godly man should be ""to cut down with the ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage."" St. Ambrose called marriage a crime against God. Origen said, ""Matrimony is impure and unholy, a means of sexual passion."" Tatian said marriage is ""a polluted and foul way of life,"" and Tertullian described it as an obscenity, a moral crime, ""more dreadful than any punishment or any death."" St. Augustine flatly declared marriage a sin. Saturninus explained that God made only two kinds of people, good men and evil women, and marriage turned good men toward evil. Jesus himself said there could be no marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30, Mark 12:25). St. Bernard wrote that it is easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his own soul.
 
 For many centuries therefore, marriage remained outside the church, under the auspices of common law. It was grudgingly accepted by religious authorities only when new laws restricted a wife's rights of ownership and inheritance, taking the means of independence away from women and turning them over to men. 
 
 Priests had abandoned the early church's rule of celibacy and had begun to take wives in the 5th and 6th centuries. But in the 11th century, the church decided to forbid clerical marriages, because they produced children to inherit property. When an unmarried priest died, all his property reverted to the church. Therefore, new papal decretals commended clergymen to turn their wives out on the street and sell their children as slaves. Some of the wives stayed on as concubines, though they were disinherited in the church's favor. By this means the church acquired a great new influx of wealth, although the women and children who were left destitute suffered terribly. 
 
 Marriage continued under the common law up to the 13th century, having no endorsement by canon law. Historian F.C. Conybeare says, ""Nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved by the church."" The earliest approach to a Christian ceremony was a simple blessing of the newlyweds in facie ecclesiae--on the porch, outside the church door--to prevent the so-called ""pollution"" of God's house. Though this blessing technically violated canon law, in 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal status because it had become too popular to ignore. It was only in the 16th century that the church finally made the priestly blessing mandatory (and, of course lucrative), refusing to recognize common-law marriages any more.","Freethought Today, November 2008",1

But I still disagree with your conclusion that ""there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders."" As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state.

In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex.

 You seem to be suggesting that the arguments by political leaders in favor of ""traditional morality"" and ""family values"" are entirely meaningless and are just pandering to popular prejudices.

 AUSTIN, Texas - The Texas Senate (search) approved a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage with a 21-8 vote Saturday, sending the issue to voters.
 
 State law already prohibits same-sex marriages. If approved in a statewide vote in November, Texas (search) would join 14 states that statutorily and constitutionally ban same-sex marriage. Massachusetts is the only state that allows such marriages, although Vermont and Connecticut have approved same-sex civil unions.
 
 Opponents have criticized the ban as discrimination against gays and lesbians and warn it could harm heterosexual families if domestic partner benefits, powers of attorney and common law marriage are called into question.
 
 Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, said none of those scenarios would be affected and would not prevent same-sex couples from adopting children. The House has voted to ban gays from becoming foster parents, but that measure has received little support in the Senate.
 
 Staples rejected arguments the amendment would discriminate against gays and lesbians and the estimated 43,000 same-sex couples in Texas.
 
 Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, equated the amendment to Jim Crow-era laws that discriminated against blacks.
 
 ""At least they had the good sense to never write their bigotry into the state Constitution,"" said Ellis, who called the amendment ""trash.""
 
 Staples said he is offended by accusations the amendment is anti-gay.
 
 ""There's a distinction between intimate associations and the right to have the government recognize or subsidize your arrangement,"" Staples said.","So???? Are we supposed to be surprised? Hardly emoticon_rolleyes 
 
 State constitutions and / or their amendments don't mean diddly squat if they are not in agreement with the US cconstitution.",1
