"3302","An interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.","I did not say that I agree with a tax incline, and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time. However there is a difference that I should point out. There is a reason for the tax incline: those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes. Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income, however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much. I won't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote, I'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality. But remember, there is a reason behind that tax incline. The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible. In this case, the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness. But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate. The point is: there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income. There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite.

"9492","(3) Although Olson effectively demonstrates that there is no reasonable justification for prohibiting same-sex marriage, only 14% of conservatives agree. What's going on here? The answer, as Olson intimates, is religion. Almost one-half of all conservatives believe that the Bible rather than the will of the People should determine public policy in the United States. Those who attend church services weekly supported Proposition 8 by a vote of 84% to 16%, whereas those who do not attend church regularly opposed Proposition 8 by a vote of 83% to 17%. Olson rejects ""religious teachings that denounce homosexuality as morally wrong"" and believes that the Constitution ""prohibits us from forcing our religious beliefs on others."" But most conservatives don't agree with him.","Count me as one of those 14% since he hasn't demonstrated anything of the sort. And it isn't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life.

 What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist?

 This is the result of your secular humanist pop culture which has completely secularized our society and has attempted to erase God and any recognition of his values from our society over the past 50 years. But what is most sad is that you will respond with the opinion that we don't even have a problem at all.

"4787","I didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have ""common law"" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?","Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.
 
 Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.

"2321","SAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge challenged the backers of California's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday to explain how allowing gay couples to wed threatens conventional unions, a demand that prompted their lawyer to acknowledge he did not know.
 
 The unusual exchange between U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker and Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the group that sponsored Proposition 8, came during a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the measure as discriminatory under the U.S. Constitution.
 
 Cooper had asked Walker to throw out the suit or make it more difficult for those civil rights claims to prevail.
 
 The judge not only refused but signaled that when the case goes to trial in January, he expects Cooper and his legal team to present evidence showing that male-female marriages would be undermined if same-sex marriages were legal.
 
 &#8216;Naturally procreative relationships&#8217;
 The question is relevant to the assertion that Proposition 8 is constitutionally valid because it furthers the states goal of fostering ""naturally procreative relationships,"" Walker explained.
 
 ""What is the harm to the procreation purpose you outlined of allowing same-sex couples to get married?"" Walker asked.
 
 ""My answer is, I don't know. I don't know,"" Cooper answered.
 
 Moment later, after assuring the judge his response did not mean Proposition 8 was doomed to be struck down, Cooper tried to clarify his position. The relevant question was not whether there is proof that same-sex unions jeopardize marriages between men and women, but whether ""the state is entitled, when dealing with radical proposals to make changes to bedrock institutions such as this ... to take a wait and see attitude,"" he said.
 
 ""There are things we can't know, that's my point,"" Cooper said. ""The people of California are entitled to step back and let the experiment unfold in Massachusetts and other places, to see whether our concerns about the health of marital unions have either been confirmed or perhaps they have been completely assuaged.""
 
 Walker pressed on, asking again for specific ""adverse consequences"" that could follow expanding marriage to include same-sex couples. Cooper cited a study from the Netherlands, where gay marriage is legal, showing that straight couples were increasingly opting to become domestic partners instead of getting married.
 
 ""Has that been harmful to children in the Netherlands? What is the adverse effect?"" Walker asked.
 
 &#8216;Proof of no harm?&#8217;
 Cooper said he did not have the facts at hand.
 
 ""But it is not self-evident that there is no chance of any harm, and the people of California are entitled not to take the risk,"" he said.
 
 ""Since when do Constitutional rights rest on the proof of no harm?"" Walker parried, adding the First Amendment right to free speech protects activities that many find offensive, ""but we tolerate those in a free society.""
 
 Walker made clear that he wants to examine other issues that are part of the political rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage but rarely surface in courtrooms. Among the questions he plans to entertain at the trial are whether sexual orientation is a fixed or immutable characteristic, whether gays are a politically powerful group, and if same-sex marriage bans such as Proposition 8 were motivated by anti-gay bias.","Judge challenges backers of gay marriage ban - Crime & courts- msnbc.com
 
 It's funny.
 I have been making these types of comments FOR YEARS to refute that pathetic attempts trying to give a constitutional justification for why the government should be able to discriminate against gay marriage.
 
 People have scoffed at the constitutional requirements of equality, but FINALLY somebody is addressing it.

 On another note, it's also interesting to see the anti-gay side taken to task.
 They casually toss out accusations that gay marriage somehow harms straight marriages or society without justification. Some like Jyoshu actually toss out such arguments, and then try to ignore the existence of such arguments...
 And now that argument is getting scrutinized by the courts and is being taken to task.

 This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality. The sexual revolution, for example, sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage. The women's liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society. Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness, and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage.
 When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of ""What's in it for me?"" concepts like responsibility, self-sacrifice, and lifelong commitment become secondary. Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying?
 And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further. From the moment God created marriage, it was designed with a man and woman in mind. God designed two sexes male and female-He did not create four sexes. Homosexual marriage cannot fulfill God's purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here.

I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life.

Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental ""morality"" to my basis.

 Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service: 
 
 ""This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible. Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling. Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way."" 
 
 During his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute, a charge that he then vigorously denied. Now, of course, he's been caught, and he admits it. 
 
 Meanwhile, Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita. He said, ""I don't believe there's any issue that's more important than this one.""
 
 It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage, the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice, are exposed for the hypocrites they are.

 [QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]
 
 Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation.

"4214","""My personal views on the subject of marriage have been shaped by my own experience, tradition and upbringing. But as Governor of New Hampshire, I recognize that I have a responsibility to consider this issue through a broader lens.
 
 ""In the past weeks and months, I have spoken with lawmakers, religious leaders and citizens. My office has received thousands of phone calls, letters and emails. I have studied our current marriage and civil union laws, the laws of other states, the bills recently passed by the legislature and our history and traditions.
 
 ""Two years ago, we passed civil unions legislation here in New Hampshire. That law gave same-sex couples in civil unions the same rights and protections as marriage. And in typical New Hampshire fashion, the people of this state embraced civil unions and agreed we needed to continue our tradition of opposing discrimination.
 
 ""At its core, HB 436 simply changes the term 'civil union' to 'civil marriage.' Given the cultural, historical and religious significance of the word marriage, this is a meaningful change.
 
 ""I have heard, and I understand, the very real feelings of same-sex couples that a separate system is not an equal system. That a civil law that differentiates between their committed relationships and those of heterosexual couples undermines both their dignity and the legitimacy of their families.
 
 ""I have also heard, and I understand, the concerns of our citizens who have equally deep feelings and genuine religious beliefs about marriage. They fear that this legislation would interfere with the ability of religious groups to freely practice their faiths.
 
 ""Throughout history, our society's views of civil rights have constantly evolved and expanded. New Hampshire's great tradition has always been to come down on the side of individual liberties and protections.
 
 ""That is what I believe we must do today.
 
 ""But following that tradition means we must act to protect both the liberty of same-sex couples and religious liberty. In their current form, I do not believe these bills accomplish those goals.
 
 ""The Legislature took an important step by clearly differentiating between civil and religious marriage, and protecting religious groups from having to participate in marriage ceremonies that violate their fundamental religious beliefs.
 
 ""But the role of marriage in many faiths extends beyond the actual marriage ceremony.
 
 ""I have examined the laws of other states, including Vermont and Connecticut, which have recently passed same-sex marriage laws. Both go further in protecting religious institutions than the current New Hampshire legislation.
 
 ""This morning, I met with House and Senate leaders, and the sponsors of this legislation, and gave them language that will provide additional protections to religious institutions.
 
 ""This new language will provide the strongest and clearest protections for religious institutions and associations, and for the individuals working with such institutions.
 It will make clear that they cannot be forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held religious principles.
 
 ""If the legislature passes this language, I will sign the same-sex marriage bill into law. If the legislature doesn't pass these provisions, I will veto it.
 
 ""We can and must treat both same-sex couples and people of certain religious traditions with respect and dignity.
 
 ""I believe this proposed language will accomplish both of these goals and I urge the legislature to pass it.","Weird, str8 atheists have been civilly marrying for eons without special stipulations - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor
 
 Meh....
 
 I personally think ""religious protection"" is much adieu over nothing, as the EXISTING first amendment adequately protects. With interracial marriage, we didn't have churches ""forced"" to perform interracial marriages they didn't want to perform.
 The same would be true of gay marriage, and I have yet to see a U.S. example disproving the protection of a church from not having to perform the gay marriage, and/or not having to allow it within their private church.
 
 But whatever...
 The legislature can easily make these changes, if the governor is accurate in saying that is all the changes amount to.
