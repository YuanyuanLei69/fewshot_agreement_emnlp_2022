"7363","Sigh.
 I knew once I started digging I would unearth NARTH lies...
 
 Let's start with their claims on the ""twin"" studies, shall we?
 From the ACTUAL article they pretend to quote...
 Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained 0.34-0.39 of the variance, the shared environment .00, and the individual specific environment 0.61-0.66 of the variance
 ....
 In men, the full twin model suggested heritability estimates of 39% for any lifetime same-sex partner (95% CI:00-59%) and 34% for total number of same-sex partners (95 CI: 00-53%), whereas unique environmental factors accounted for 61%
 Genetic and Environmental Effects on Same-sex Sexual Behavior: A Population Study of Twins in Sweden
 
 Also, quoting the author of the study:
 ""Overall, genetics accounted for around 35 per cent of the differences between men in homosexual behaviour and other individual-specific environmental factors (that is, not societal attitudes, family or parenting which are shared by twins) accounted for around 64 per cent. In other words, men become gay or straight because of different developmental pathways, not just one pathway.""
 Homosexual behaviour due to genetics and environmental factors Queen Mary, University of London
 
 With no surprise, NARTH lied and tried to down-play the genetic results, whereas the ACTUAL STUDY CONFIRMED genetic contribution to sexual orientation. emoticon_rolleyes
 
 =======================================================================
 
 Addition:
 I saw NARTH quoted ""townhall.com"", which is absolutely absurd for any scientific pretense.
 They reference: ""Prager, D. (2005). ""College Taught Her Not To Be a Heterosexual."" Available on the web at: Townhall.com.""
 
 They didn't give a direct link to the article, and when I looked at the article I realized why...
 Dennis Prager : College taught her not to be a heterosexual - Townhall.com
 The article IS NOT scientific by any pretense.
 Dennis, an editorialist, interviews ONE WOMAN and from there proclaims this individual's experiences as ""typical"" and proof of his conclusions on millions of college women.
 And the funny thing is that Dennis reaches this conclusion IN SPITE OF what this woman actually tells him.
 This woman describes her life experience, and her interpretation of how she came to be where she is today.
 Dennis, in his thorough lack of knowledge on homosexuals, presumes to contradict her experience. It's obvious he had reached his opinion long before the interview, and nothing the woman said was going to sway him.
 
 And NARTH ACTUALLY CITES THIS in their ""research""???
 Yet another reason why I think ""NARTH"" should NEVER be confused with legitimate science. They are an organization formed for political purposes and backed by people with political purposes. Political purposes which EXCLUSIVELY revolve around being anti-gay...","You have not proven any lies....Sorry, you have not.
 The studies were done in different countries.
 AND, since the APA is now also reporting the lack of
 genetic evidence, obviously there are no lies involved.

 causes of homosexuality?
 
 These are professionals, belonging
 to the APA, including their former presidents and leaders...Sorry but you
 are wrong, the paper includes studies from different countries
 on twins, the facts are it is an ""environmental"" cause not a 
 genetic cause......that is what the studies are showing and even
 the APA is beginning to change it their writing suggesting reparative
 therapies will work, depending on the cause...

"7141","1) I haven't read the Bible cover to cover. So, please cite the where the term ""marriage"" is used in the Bible.","Where to start. The term Marriage appears 41 times in the NIV (New International Version). The term Marry appears 42 times in the NIV. But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation don't want to consider at all. For example, here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled. 
 
 Hbr 13:4 Marriage {is to be held} in honor among all, and the {marriage} bed {is to be} undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
 And here is where God consecrated the relationship (Marriage) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve. He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time. 
 
 No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world, homosexuals included. Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal.
 Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them(Adam and Eve), and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.""Exd 22:19 ""Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.
 Sex with animals was once a death penalty offense. Today, we have web sites promoting it.
 
 Lev. 20:13 ""'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
 
 ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their 
 women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
 
 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
 
 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things 
 deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also 
 approve of those who practice them.
 
 Now all one must do to rationally determine that God, through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality. If God considers homosexuality so unnatural an act and a death penalty offense under the OT Law, do you really believe that He thinks gay marriage is right, acceptable or normal?",-2.14285714286,0

 The poll also identified significant differences on the same-sex marriage issue along racial lines. But the opposition to gay nuptials by blacks doesn't appear to be as strong as local gay marriage opponents have predicted.
 
 An overwhelming 83 percent of whites responding to the poll said they favor legalizing same-sex marriage, while 12 percent oppose it. A bare majority of 51 percent of blacks said they oppose legalizing gay marriage in the District; 37 percent polled said they support it.
 
 According to the survey, 4 percent of whites and 12 percent of blacks said they had no opinion on the issue.
 
 Although the poll's finding that an overall majority of 56 percent support legalized same-sex marriage at this time, LGBT activists familiar with ballot measures on the issue in other states could view the D.C. poll results with caution. In a number of states, including California, voter support for same-sex marriage dropped sharply following well funded and what LGBT activists called highly negative campaigns waged by same-sex marriage opponents.
 
 Voter initiatives or referenda seeking to prohibit same-sex marriage have won in every state where they've been placed on the ballot.
 
 In D.C., a 1978 law barring ballot measures that would result in discrimination against minorities protected by the city's Human Rights Act has so far prevented local opponents of same-sex marriage from putting the issue up for a public vote. The opponents have vowed to continue to challenge city rulings against a marriage ballot measure in court.
 
 The Post poll shows that white and black voters differ sharply over whether to bring the gay marriage question to a public vote. Among blacks, 70 percent responding to the poll favor holding a citywide vote on the issue, while 25 percent say a ballot measure should not be held. Six percent had no opinion.
 
 Among whites, 58 percent opposed bringing the gay marriage issue to a public vote; 39 percent favored such a vote. Three percent had no opinion.
 
 The Post's poll included responses from 1,135 adults reached by either landline or cell phone during Jan. 24-28. The paper says the poll has a 3 percent margin of error.","http://www.dcagenda.com/2010/02/08/majority-backs-gay-marriage-ballot-measure-in-poll/

 Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce ""remotely"" from Virginia.
 
 Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.",-1,0

That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.",-1.57142857143,0
"7130","People as a whole are largely biased, uninformed, and care only about the wellbeing of the majority, persecuting the minority any chance they get. Simply put, the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority, and this can be seen everywhere throughout history. The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed, for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all; it is the voice of the majority.","Yours is the voice of a bitter gay person talking, who has only seen one side of things (probably hardship). But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right. In fact I think typcially, the populace DOES take care of people--I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people. That's my opinion.
 
 I think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know that this is not a civil rights issue, despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way. I will say this though: gay people need to be treated as well as anyone else in this country and acts of violence should not be permitted. We should all be able to get along. But that doesn't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it.
 
 As I said, states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition, and 13 states have already done so--many others are working on it. You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily.",-3.25,0

 Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called ""lawlessness"". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.
 
 It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some ""agenda"" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.
 
 I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.","Hey, laws are just laws, they can be overturned by any activist judge. So what is there about marriage which is absolute? If nothing, then anyone can marry anyone or anything, its just the whim of a judge which decides. That is where we are heading, and heading fast.
 These laws stop them for now. But even five years ago, no one would have believed that same-sex marriage could be legislated over the objections of the voters. 
 The gay lobby argues that all love should be celebrated and marriage allowed, tradition notwithstanding. So, the next logical step is that a group of people are being discriminated against, or a human/pet couple is being discriminated against, and the rot spreads.",-2,0
