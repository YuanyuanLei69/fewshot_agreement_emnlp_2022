 * the state of being a married couple voluntarily joined for life (or until divorce); ""a long and happy marriage""; ""God bless this union""
 * two people who are married to each other; ""his second marriage was happier than the first""; ""a married couple without love""
 * the act of marrying; the nuptial ceremony; ""their marriage was conducted in the chapel""
 * a close and intimate union; ""the marriage of music and dance""; ""a marriage of ideas""

The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights, liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples. Civil Unions are non-transportable, meaning a civil union from one state cannot be recognized in other states. 
 
 Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage, fine. That goes for heterosexuals as well. I just can't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a ""civil union"" being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability. 
 
 I have als been asked before, in another forum, if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states. My answer is, yes. Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition, benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states.

 Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election, with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it, though both candidates support civil unions (PACS).
 
 ....
 On June 5, 2004, former Green Party presidential candidate Noël Mamère, Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Bègles, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, Bertrand Charpentier and Stéphane Chapin. Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights.
 
 French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"6038","First Same-Sex Marriage Licenses Issued in DC - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men
 
 
 Thanks to yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, marriage equality is headed to Washington, DC. Gay and lesbian couples were allowed to start applying for marriage licenses first thing this morning. The District of Columbia is now the sixth place in the US where gays can marry legally and the very first located south of the Mason-Dixon line, which is notable at least in its symbolism alone.
 
 Sinjoyla Townsend and Angelisa Young, partnered for 12 years, were the first couple to receive a same-sex marriage license. Young said that ""It's like waking up Christmas morning. The marriage bureau was expected to bring in extra employees to help with the number of couples expected to apply for a license.
 
 Due to a provision in the law, marriages cannot be held right away. Instead, ""three full days must pass between the day of application to the day that the license can be issued.""
 
 So expect full marital bliss in Washington to occur on March 9.","Yet another example of a court ramming gay marriage down the public's throats. I wonder how long it'll take DC to generate a ballot initiative to reverse the court? emoticon_rolleyes",0

"1522","If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible, that's fine. But the Bible, like many other foreign documents, has no place in politics. Religious influence in government is highly un-American.","It's amazing how little you godless heathens have studied the writings of the founding fathers.
 
 Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in America's public school classrooms:
 
 The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding father's quotations.
 
 The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the 'Mayflower Compact,' dated November 11, 1620:
 
 ""....Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of
 the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a
 voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;
 Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of
 God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together
 into a Civil Body....""
 
 Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained,
 
 ""Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine...Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants...""
 
 Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case ""Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States"" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, ""We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....""
 
 In another Supreme Court Case, ""Zorach vs. Clauson"" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, ""We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."" Further, in ""United States vs. Macintosh"" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, ""We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.""
 
 At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: ""...The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that 'except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.""
 
 There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29.
 
 Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, ""The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.""
 
 In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: ""The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were...the general principles of Christianity.""
 
 Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, ""The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles...This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government.""
 
 Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the ""Stamp Act Resolutions,"" made public after his death) we read:
 
 ""Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse
 will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which
 a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be
 great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be
 miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.""
 
 Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said:
 
 ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have
 removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the
 people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are
 not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my
 country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice
 cannot sleep forever."" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)
 
 ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we
 are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their
 native land and planted them in a country flowing with all
 the necessities and comforts of life."" (Monday, March 4,
 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)
 
 Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise.
 
 Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated:
 
 ""A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never
 seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,
 that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.""
 (Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)
 
 George Washington, the ""Father of our Country,"" likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:
 
 ""It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my
 fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over
 the universe.""
 
 On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:
 
 ""It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of
 Almighty God.""
 
 Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, ""If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality."" How prophetic he was!
 
 Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the ""Father of Public Schools,"" once had this to offer: ""The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.""
 
 Don't miss the significance of that last statement: ""..without virtue there can be no liberty...."" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings)."" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.
 
 Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, ""...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....""
 
 And finally, let's not forget James Madison, known as the ""Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution,"" who once had this to say:
 
 ""Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ.""
 
 This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear.
 
 And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. ""Thou shalt not"" has been replaced with, ""If it feels good do it."" The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and ""Father God"" has been replaced with ""Mother Earth."" America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation ""of the people, by the people, and for the people,"" was clearly founded. (RighterReport.com)",0
"4825","gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it?","Well, the simple answer to this question is ""No it is not."" Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay, not in any way shape or form. Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to, the people one loves, and the person one wants to spend his or her life with.
 
 Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it, but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair, unjust, unequal, and a detriment to happiness. On the issue of gay rights, most (but maybe not all) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one, so they stand against it. They do not simply hate convention because it is convention; good convention is worth retaining.",0

 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 
 
 You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.",0

 The two cities were not condemned because of rampant homosexual activities, you of course know this, it has been explained to you, it has been shown to you, but when you want to be right nothing else matters. 
 
 Why is it that modern Christians have an undeniable obsession regarding homosexuals? Jesus obviously didn't consider it worth mentioning, but he did have a problem with divorce. Yet that is a protected right. The Holy Mother Church will disobey Jesus and grant divorce, but holds on tight to another misinterpretation. 
 
 The blind leading the blind in blissful ignorance. How pist will you be having to spend some time in the pit because of something like this?

"2834","But of course, the real issue is whether or not changing marriage is a civil right to begin with, because these ballot initiatives are generally about whether marriage should be protected from being redefined.","No, the issue is about civil rights.

The government is giving out perks and bennies, and has arbitrarily decided to exclude one group from qualifiying, even though they meet all meaningful qualificaitons. It's that simple; even you see it. Look at what you said above. Not ""getting married"" is a civil right. ""changing marriage"". Whenever you dance so prettily it's clear that you know where the landmines are, and are desperately trying to avoid them.",0
"9402","Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental ""morality"" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like ""cheating"" or ""rape"".","Really? 
 
 If ""nature"" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been ""eliminated"" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your ""individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type. 
 
 Even animals that have ""normal"" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor. 
 
 Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is ""the standard"" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is ""natural"" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a ""greater purpose"". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given ""purpose"" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was ""made"" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or ""life"", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.",0

You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper. The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever. I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief.

Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"".

"7550","What makes you so certain that the minority is right on this issue?","Well, now this is the question that really matters, and the answer is a long one. But to state it as simply as possible: denying same-sex marriage hurts many people. It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages. It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance, along with the many other benefits of marriage. It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong, and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society.
 
 There is no reason to perpetuate these harms. I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage, but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms. In fact, I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all. Thus, even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits, there would be no reason to keep it illegal; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone, unless it has a very good reason to. And there just isn't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.",0

 According to the bible, the sin nature affects all aspects of our lives from diseases to the aging process to unnatural proclivities to sins such as rape, murder, adultery, homosexuality, incest, susceptibility to sex, alcohol and drug addiction, and innumerable other activities of the flesh which declare that we are seriously flawed due to our fall from grace which was brought about by our original sin of rebellion against God by disobeying Him via Adam and Eve.

"6248","I've never quite understood why so many gay rights advocates give such leeway toward Democrat candidates. Here we have one flat out saying they don't support gay marriage. Yet as usual, the only ones being criticized for it are the Republicans, and the DNC candidates are getting a pass on it. It seems to me that the real news here is that Biden, the Democrat nominee with gay special-interest constituents, so emphatically came out against gay marriage at that debate. But of course, we aren't hearing any of that from the gay press, who (as usual) are giving their candidates a free pass. Why aren't they demanding Biden explain his emphatic answering of ""no"" to that question? Why aren't they demanding that HE clarify?","Because it's all quite clear. Decades of effort from the religious right, conservative republicans, and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic.

The democrats, as a whole, want to do the right thing, but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything. They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action. 
 
 This is of course a generalization, but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable. Generally speaking dems don't trumpet gay rights because they know how many votes it'll cost them, and thus prevent them from actually working for gays rights. Reps don't trumpet gay right because they don't support gay rights.

"4577","In my opinion, we don't give the American people nearly enough credit to assume they can't be trusted with issues like this. Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think gay marriage is wrong is simply because it IS. But I can tell you that I believe strongly enough in the American system that if enough of the public get behind gay marriage and support it to the point where it becomes legal in all the states, I would accept that as what America wants. What I don't accept is judges (individuals) deciding these issues, even going so far as to go against the American people. That is a VERY dangerous precedent that is much more monarchial than anything.","I know that there was a time that America wanted slavery. I know that there was a time that America wanted women to be inferior. I know that there was a time when America wanted to (and did) kick out atheists. But I do not care what America wants. I care what helps the most people. And if America wants to help the most people, then I do not mind letting it. But to suggest that it is a good thing to allow the majority of Americans to vote on how many rights the minority gets is to ignore the reality of the tyranny of the majority. 
 
 To hear you speak on monarchy, it sounds to me that you believe slavery, women's sufferage, segregation, or any past instance of tyranny of the majority was fixed by a majority vote of the people. But in reality, it was the national-level government officials and the judges who came to the aid of the minority, not the majority. And the majority disapproved of those decisions until they were replaced by a younger generation.
 
 Our Constitution is designed to give ulitmate power to the people but to prevent them from making decisions themselves. It is designed to allow them to decide which individuals make the decisions, but the majority does not get to make those decisions. Our Constitution gives the majority vote no power except the power to decide who is elected (in fact, it originally gave legislators the power to elect the Senate, not the people). It certainly gives the majority vote no power to change the Constitution. It does this because any one person or group cannot be trusted with power. The majority will abuse its power as surely as anyone else will, even if that majority is well-intentioned, and the majority will be held accountable to no one.
 
 The majority should never be trusted to decide the rights of the minority, and I think that is the most important thing I can say.",0
