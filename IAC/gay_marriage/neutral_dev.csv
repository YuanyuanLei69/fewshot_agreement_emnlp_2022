"1396","What I'd prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views, whether it's popular or unpopular. But even knowing we're talking about political candidates (who may lie to get votes), when a candidate says something is his or her view, I think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically. Otherwise, there's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure, and so forth. Political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as HIS or HER view, they are taken at their word that IS their view. ""No"" can't mean ""yes"" and so forth.","No, that's too niave an approach. We know politicians are going to tell some lies, I trust that's a given. We, as political consumers, can't simply take politicians at their word. If we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they're saying. We need to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, how big their lies are. Obviously we shouldn't need to do this, it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word. Bad the sad reality is that we can't, not at this stage anyway. 
 
 In this particular case, if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage I'm just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason. It's sad that such double speak is needed, I'd love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies, but until that wonderful day I'm not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word, nor am I going to jump up and down and point fingers at every falsehood. I'll try to judge the politicians by their actions, and their lies by their magnitude, scope, and quantity.",0,1

I was agreeing with a post by Flygirl which pointed out that the hospital displayed a basic lack of common decency, which I trust you also agree with.","Sure I agree with it. The thing is, you used to argue (not in these exact words of course) that decency on the part of the hospital wasn't required, all that gays needed to do was visit a lawyer and they'd be all set.

"558","You mean where the judge did the job she's paid to do by ruling on the constitutionality of a law? Or is this only a problem when it's laws that you like that are ruled unconstitutional?
 
 This is Civics 101. If the legislature writes a law that is unconstitutional, it's the job of the judicial branch to strike it down. The legislature can then rewrite the law, or get the constitution amended. I've yet to see you demonstrate this process being abused in the matter of gay marriage. All you've done is point out rulings you don't like.","True so true emoticon_xgood
 Now a true judicial activist would rule the unconstitutional the very state amendments that definds marriage between a man and a woman even though they are in the constitution.

"8772","- Democrats are tokenizing gay rights groups. If the recent election and stance by John Kerry does not alarm gay rights activists, something is terribly wrong. In the end, there was very, very little difference in the stance between the two candidates regarding gay rights. The marriage amendment was the only difference, but to be fair, gay activists should say that Kerry saw them no more 'human' than Bush. Unfortunately for gay people, they have been taken and cheated by the Democratic party. The most they have gotten is token words and occassional promises that never really take place. But in the debates, Kerry was just as unappoving of gay marriage as Bush was. So why would gay rights activists overwhelmingly support Kerry and the Democratic party? Can't they see they have been sold a rotten bill of goods? Democrats have been no more helpful in the last 20 years--Clinton himself would not veto DOMA, signing it instead. It is difficult to take gay rights groups seriously when they throw their enthusiastic support at only Democrat canididates who are practically no different than Republican ones on the issue. Frankly, it smacks of partisanship and backroom politics. Gay people are the losers. Does that mean that gay people would be better off supporting Republicans? Not necessarily. But at least a little less blind political allegiance would help. At this point, it would seem that even if the Republican party ran a gay candidate who supported gay marriage enthusiastically, gay rights groups would still endorse the Democrat. Yes, it's THAT bad.","I think the Democrats are generally seen as the lesser of two evils. Your point about gay rights groups perhaps endorsing a Democrat out of blind party loyalty over a pro- gay marriage Republican is an interesting point. Perhaps the answer is for those in all parties who are gay, to be more aggressive in promoting their equality. A lot of work needs to be done in both the Democratic and Republican parties.",0.4,1
"2400","Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it.

It'll just be a matter of seperating the real answers from the bogus ones. Given how politcal the issue is I'm not going to accept any claims for correctness that don't cite actual specific law.

 The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted ""legally"" was ruled on by the courts.
 
 What is discussed above is entirely separate.
 To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.

"6970","Actually I have no problem with civil unions as long as civil unions replace the marriage certificate.","For those that argue over the pretense of ""marriage is a religious institution"", I don't know why they don't push SOLELY for what governmental involvement of ""civil unions"".
 
 After all, if the government has a hand in the institution of marriage, it's not just a ""religious institution"".
 
 Moreover, those fighting against gay marriage are doing so SOLELY in the governmental arena. If a gay couple gets married in their church, that's entirely legal in 50 states with no attempts to make it illegal.

"1671","Leaders of the campaign to outlaw same-sex marriage in California are warning businesses that have given money to the state's largest gay rights group they will be publicly identified as opponents of traditional unions unless they contribute to the gay marriage ban, too.
 
 ProtectMarriage.com, the umbrella group behind a ballot initiative that would overturn the California Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage, sent a certified letter this week asking companies to withdraw their support of Equality California, a nonprofit organization that is helping lead the campaign against Proposition 8.
 
 ""Make a donation of a like amount to ProtectMarriage.com which will help us correct this error,"" reads the letter. ""Were you to elect not to donate comparably, it would be a clear indication that you are in opposition to traditional marriage. ... The names of any companies and organizations that choose not to donate in like manner to ProtectMarriage.com but have given to Equality California will be published.""
 
 The letter was signed by four members of the group's executive committee: campaign chairman Ron Prentice; Edward Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic Conference; Mark Jansson, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and Andrew Pugno, the lawyer for ProtectMarriage.com. A donation form was attached. The letter did not say where the names would be published.
 
 The unusual appeal reflects the increasing tension surrounding the tight race over Proposition 8, which would change the California Constitution to limit marriage to a man and a woman. In recent days, both sides in the debate have accused their opponents of threatening their respective campaign volunteers and misleading voters.Calif. gay marriage ban backers target businesses
