 Hmmm...wonder if I could get my partner to actually step onto a plane...
 
 Hey, has TF Green changed all that much in the past fifteen years? 
 
 At least I've got some friends I could stay with!!! (and no...I don't mean you...remember I used to live in RI)","TF Green was a small little airport when I moved here 10years ago. It is now 10 times that size with multiple terminals and dozens of airlines. Yes, it has changed. It would be fun! My friends are trying to talk me into a UUC minister. Since we don't really have anyone to officiate the ceremony, I am guessing that is the ruote we will need to take.
 
 We did decide today to axe the cake thing....too hetero for me.
 We decided it really will be at my boss's house.....yeah!
 We picked a date in September......woo woo.
 
 I will update you all as we plan!",1.2,2

 We even have one quote.
 
 
 
 So it seems that gay people and our families are to remain 2nd class citizens to preserve this evil mans heterosexual privledge. How is it that ""the way he was brought up"" is more important then protecting gay people? 
 
 What of they way gay people were brought up? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents? I was brought up by my father, taught in school that all people are equal. His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up. 
 
 I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse. I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan. Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan.","Very sad news. 
 
 I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.",2.2,2

"2675","Its such a joke that the anti-gay side claims that gays are a threat to the family. I would like to see them come up with some situation where this was done to a heterosexual family.","Yeah, but then they'd have to admit that the reason it was done to a ""heterosexual family"" is because that family was black, interracial, Jewish, or some other object of prejudice.
 And there is no way they would admit that comparison...",2.5,2
"8199","They only need 1/4 of the legislature, so they'll probably get that. But if it actually gets to the polls? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming ""If gays get married society will collapse and we'll all be doomed!!!11!1!!"" and then nothing happened. And of course the most organized group in Mass. opposing gay marriage is the Mass. Catholic church, and people aren't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what's right and wrong. The anti-gay side really doesn't have much to work with; it'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics, and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong.","This will be interesting.

"6318","Wow, San Francisco........What a shocker........","In this case, I have to agree with you. We're talking about the most absolute bizarrely liberal (to the point of absurdity) place in the country. The idea of 'rights' has gotten dog-gone crazy there . . . they even regulate the nutritional content of food for pets, and require dog-houses have raised floors in them. They've basically done away with a number of illegal drug laws. They're working to BAN handgun ownership altogether. (One has to wonder how we can take their insistence of gay marriage as being constitutional seriously when they are trying to completely ignore the 2nd Amendment!)
 
 Despite their liberal regulatory fanaticism, it's actually a very beautiful place to visit!",1.6,2
"8104","My GOD! anti gay or not, where's common decency?? My heart breaks for that poor family. I hope that hospital has to pay through the nose for what it did to those poor children, denying them the opportunity to see their dying parent. I really don't care what the politics are in that poor, backward state. there is simply no excuse for treating childen like that. Also, this is a hospital, and there was an accurate medical history available to them they did not avail themselves of. This is gross negligence!","I agree...",5,2
"1685","First off, Congratulations are in order (HUGZ)!
 
 As for a ceremony:
 
 If were to ever get married, I think it would be relatively small (50 to 100 people max) and out in a an open meadow (weather permitting), or at least a lush green park or back yard. My partner and I would escort each other up the aisle in matching grey tuxes, to a simple platform with a white garden archway decorated in white flowers, where a justice of the peace presides over a simple ceremony. We would read vows to one another and then be pronounced partners in life, and then just have a fabulous garden party.
 
 How doeas that sound?","Pretty close to what we are doing.
 
 It is going to be outdoors, in my boss's backyard (nice area). It will be small, family, friends, 40 people tops. We will have some kind of food, haven't figured that yet. Got a really small budget. We plan on the vows, and rings and our parents doing something.
 
 Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide.",2.16666666667,2
"1847","Is it possible that the ""rigidity"" of many evangelical churches and what they expect of their members drives couples to divorce when one partner isn't as ""on board"" as the other? Many people have only joined these churches of late and were already married when they did. Just thinkin'.","I think you nailed it!

"4868","The 2010 US Census will now include married gay couples. The Census Bureau have announced that married gay and lesbian couples would be counted in the 2010 national tally, previously barred in several states by the 1996 law DOMA, which defines marriage as a heterosexual union for federal agencies.
 
 ""They will be counted, and they ought to report the way they see themselves,"" says Steve Jots, spokesman for the Census Bureau. ""In the normal process of reports coming out after the census of 2010, I think the country will have a good data set on which to discuss this phenomenon that is evolving in this country.""
 
 ""This is about folks' identity,"" Jost added. ""We are experienced in dealing with changing social phenomena and how to measure and report it, and we want to get it right.""","Gay Blog - QueerSighted

"9038","The only reason that this was even posted was because it was another attempt to discredit anyone that is against gay marriage. The fact that most politicians cheat isn't a revelation.","Amen!! Sheeesh, here we go again with this garbage. The funny thing is, it only seems to mostly be the pro gay rights people who go on these silly ""hypocrisy"" witch hunts. People could, no doubt, just as easily find cases to trump where proponents of gay marriage have been promiscuous, divorced, engaged in prostitution, or whatever-other vice-of-the-day is in terms of discreditation. And that too would, of course, be hypocritical. But I never see posts about that here--nor would I want to. The real reason these cases are posted about is that there are folks here who simply enjoy seeing people they fundamentally disagree with and that they just don't like get publicly humiliated. All the while, there's not a one of these 'exposers of hypocrisy' who would much like having someone do that to them. Personally, I think this need and obvious enjoyment some here have over seeing people get publicly humiliated is, well, sorta disturbing.",1.2,2

 Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one ""goes further"" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &#8220;left behind&#8221; feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce.",2,2

"7134","If marriage is so sacred socially, then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce, and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time shouldn't be allowed (Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette). This shouldn't be a social issue because if it is, it's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes. 
 
 The government should approach this as a legal matter, which it is, and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy. If you have a problem with it socially, then you probably also have a problem with homosexuals in the first place, and thats a problem that you need to deal with on your own. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions (or dare I say ""marriages"") to same sex couples and let that be the end of it. If the word marriage bothers you so much because of the religious background of the word, get over it. The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word's definition is derived from. Atheist couples get married in courthouses because ""marriage"" in the legal sense has no religious affiliation. So, this being a purely legal matter, there should be no question that any two people can enjoy this legal right.","I COMPLETELY AGREE.

 To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....
