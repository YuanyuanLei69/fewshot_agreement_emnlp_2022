 Who's really playing the game here?
 I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.
 
 Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)
 
 For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)
 1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.
 2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.
 3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.
 
 It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.
 
 Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.
 
 You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying ""well I want to""...or in your case... ""shhh...it's a secret"".
 
 You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings. You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights, yet won't give us reasons for your position. I find that appalling. Yet you are content with labeling me as ""playing games"".

 Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service: 
 
 ""This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible. Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling. Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way."" 
 
 During his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute, a charge that he then vigorously denied. Now, of course, he's been caught, and he admits it. 
 
 Meanwhile, Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita. He said, ""I don't believe there's any issue that's more important than this one.""
 
 It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage, the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice, are exposed for the hypocrites they are.

 by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff 
 
 Posted: February 22, 2008 - 1:00 pm ET
 
 (Miami, Florida) Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond had planned to take their three children on a family cruise. The Olympia, Washington couple had been together 18 years and with their children were looking forward to the holiday.
 
 But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami, Florida. Pond, a healthy 39-year-old, suddenly collapsed. She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind.
 
 But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about Ponds's medical history. 
 
 Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state, and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family. 
 
 A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery.
 
 Other than one five minute visit, which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at Langbehn's request to perform last rites, and despite the doctor's acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation, neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival. 
 
 Soon after Pond''s death, Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children. She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner.

 Note the above.
 She was informed she was in an ""anti-gay state""...
 
 1) As I have pointed out before, some of the ""anti-gay marriage"" amendments go well and beyond just ""no gay marriage"" to antagonizing gays by stating in law that gays cannot perform certain legal functions, regardless of whether or not it is called ""marriage"".
 
 2) Does anybody have any real doubt that if the two ladies had just walked in as ""friends"", that this problem would not have happened?
 
 3) I think this furthers my point regarding how some people's actions and statements FURTHER anti-gay bullying, and that refusing to acknowledge this relationship, or ""blame"", is futile.
 The hospital perpetrated this gross violation of human decency invoking the STATE stance.","Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not, it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health. The hospital staff erred in denying the visits, especially those of the children. The denial of the partner's bedside visit is also deplorable. There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party. If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them, it should certainly be permitted.

"5393","The term PACS stands for Pacte Civil de Solidarité, which was introduced into French law on 15 November 1999.
 
 Put simply, a PACS is a contract signed by two people of the same sex or opposite sex, who are over 18 years old and want to organise their life together. It's an agreement that cannot be entered into by two people who are part of the same family, who are already married or who are already part of a PACS.
 
 The contract - which can prepared by the parties themselves or by their lawyer - is registered together with all relevant documents at the registered office of the civil court in the area where the couple live.
 
 ..................
 
 
 The couple are free to detail their obligations to each other in the contract. But in any case by law they are obliged to help and assist each other. 
 
 The precise level of support is proportional to their income. The couple are jointly responsible for any debts incurred by the other through normal daily living - but not if those expenses are deemed excessive. All other debts remain an individual's personal responsibility. 
 
 Unless the couple have decided to hold their assets in common according to the system of 'indivision' - where each item bought after the PACS is signed is deemed to belong jointly to both of the partners - the estates of each partner remain separate. Each partner remains the owner of the assets he or she buys - and responsible for his or her debts. 
 
 The main advantages of a PACS are concerned with tax. The 'pacsés' as they are known in France benefit from being taxed as a couple - and not as two separate individuals. This can often reduce their overall income tax burden
 
 And since August 2007, the surviving partner of a PACS benefits from the same inheritance tax regime as a surviving spouse in a married couple - which means there are no death duties to pay.","Bonus question:

It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people. People as a whole are largely biased, uninformed, and care only about the wellbeing of the majority, persecuting the minority any chance they get. Simply put, the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority, and this can be seen everywhere throughout history. The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed, for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all; it is the voice of the majority.
 
 I cannot know the intentions of the creators of the California goverment when they created their judicial system, but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation, then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do: judge laws which persecute the minority, assuring that the government cannot engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation. If the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51% of the population wishes to force upon the other 49%, then our government would be tyrannical in no time.

If it were not so, there would be no discussion upon the subject. I don't think you can really ask this of people and expect it to make sense. Yeah, a lot of people are harmed, but mostly because of religion and moral beliefs. Without these beliefs there would be no opposition to gay marriges. Ugly, but true.",0,1

Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.",0,1

I'd like to think that she does care about the moral concerns of most people in the nation, but it's starting to become more and more apparent that may not be the case.
 
 At the rate they are going, gay rights people in this country are going to bring a constitutional amendment on themselves before they truly realize the value of actually trying to see the issue through someone's eyes other than their own, and actually dialoging rather than trying to dictate their views onto the nation. By then it will be too late.",-0.833333333333,1
