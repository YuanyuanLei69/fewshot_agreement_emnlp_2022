"5725","It becomes somewhat irritating to deal with people who's ignorance is matched only by their arrogance. Election day saw a sweeping repudiation of legally sanctioned same sex marriage in 11 different states, including relatively progressive Oregon. This follows similiar votes for amendments defining marriage in California and Missouri. What does this all mean? Well, for starters, it indicates that a federal marriage amendment has a fighting chance. It should remind us that sanctioning gay nuptials hasn't one thing to do with the oval office occupant.
 It is well known, or should be known, that the process for amending the constitution does not involve the President.
 
 The Amendment Process
 
 There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how it can be amended. One has never been used.
 
 The first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).
 
 The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.
 
 Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken, the amendment must be approved by three-fourths of states. The amendment as passed may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention. See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention. Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default. Only one amendment, the 21st, specified a convention. In any case, passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority.
 
 It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process (though he would be free to make his opinion known). He cannot veto an amendment proposal, nor a ratification.
 
 In spite of this, opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal. Apparently, it's easier to identify a single scapegoat or hold up an unworthy strawman for condemnation than it is to recognize that there is an overriding public sentiment against alternative lifestyles being officially sanctioned.","I've seen people (on TV:)) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment. Don't ask me how they figure this. It's just what they were saying.",2

 ""The California Democratic Party is now a leading partner in statewide efforts to ensure that all California families enjoy the legal protections that they deserve,"" said Eric Stern, National Stonewall Democrats Executive Director who addressed the convention. 
 
 The resolution calls for civil marriage to be extended to same-sex couples. It passed unanimously and as the vote was being taken many delegates displayed signs that read ""AB 19"" in support of an assembly bill that would extend civil marriage to same-sex couples. The legislation was recently introduced by Assemblyman Mark Leno, an openly-gay Democrat from San Francisco.
 
 The vote makes California the fourth state Democratic party to officially call for marriage equality. The Democratic parties of Massachusetts, New York and Washington State have all expressed support for marriage equality, either by resolution or through a state party platform.
 
 The Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, authored by Leno, is expected to pass through the Assembly Judiciary Committee on April 26.
 
 The legislation would allow gays and lesbians to marry while protecting the rights of churches opposed to same-sex marriage to refuse to perform the weddings.

 I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them.

"1650","Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD
 An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe, where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 (beginning in Denmark), there is a correlation between same-sex marriage (or civil unions) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.
 
 In ""Forsaking All Others? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage' on Risky Sex,"" Thomas S. Dee writes:
 
 One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals. A specific implication of this claim is that ""gay marriage"" will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In this study, I present a simple 2-period model, which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce (or increase) the prevalence of STI. Then, I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates. These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe, where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989. The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates. However, these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV. [from the paper's abstract]
 
 Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project. He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books, including No Child Left Behind?: The Politics and Practice of School Accountability, Developments in School Finance, and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths.
 
 Dee's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships:
 
 These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce, perhaps dramatically, the social costs associated with STI like syphilis. In the United States, over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 (CDC 2004b). And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $1 billion, which reflects in large part, the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV (CDC 1999). However, the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health. For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage, these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships.
 
 
 The full paper provides extensive economic analysis, including charts and graphs, and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept.

 Religious Right Group Claims Same Sex Marriage Leads to Mass Murder | | AlterNet
 
 Is there a connection between same-sex marriage and mass murder?
 
 That's what one religious right outfit is suggesting. This week, Morality in Media disseminated a statement noting that the Iowa Supreme Court had legalized gay marriage on the same day that a gunman murdered 13 people in Binghamton, New York. The headline on the release: ""Connecting the Dots: The Line Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders."" The group's president, Bob Peters, notes that the ""underlying problem is that increasingly we live in a 'post-Christian' society, where Judeo-Christian faith and values have less and less influence."" And, he continues, this ""secular value system is also reflected in the 'sexual revolution,' which is the driving force behind the push for 'gay marriage.'""
 
 Here's the punch line:
 
 It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement! It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality; and it is the decline of morality (and the faith that so often under girds it) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders. 
 
 That is, he's not saying that gay rights activists are directly responsible for the murderous actions of gun-toting madmen. But Peters maintains that those who champion gay rights are undermining the moral fiber of society and that this assault on traditional values creates an environment in which killing sprees can more easily occur. These acts of gun violence, he insists, are the poisoned fruit of the push for gay marriage.
 
 Talk about exploiting tragedy to advance an agenda. It might be tempting to dismiss Peters and Morality in Media as marginal, but this group did receive federal funding from 2005 through 2007. The money supported a Morality in Media project, ObscenityCrimes.org, which paid two retired law enforcement officers to review citizen complaints about obscenity on the Internet and to forward the best leads to the US Justice Department for possible prosecution. A total of $300,000 was provided to Morality in Media through two earmarks Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) placed into spending bills, according to Peters. And a portion of that money went to cover Peters' salary. As The New York Times reported in 2007, no obscenity prosecutions had resulted from the Morality in Media's obscenity-tracking work.
 
 Peters tells me that since 2007 -- thanks to the fuss about earmarks -- he has received no more funds from the US government. After the earmarked grants ran out in 2007, he did apply directly to the Justice Department and was turned down. Since then, he has raised private funds to keep ObscenityCrimes.org going. That may be for the best -- particularly for Morality in Media. Peters has recently attacked President Barack Obama's pick for deputy attorney general, David Ogden, as an ""ACLU-minded"" sort who would ""likely weaken"" government efforts ""to curb sexual trafficking and sexual exploitation of children."" It would be difficult -- or, at least, awkward -- for Peters to blast a Justice Department that was funding his own work.
 
 In his statement on gay marriage and mass murder, Peters notes that Christianity and Judaism teach ""that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves and to forgive others."" But on the subject of gay marriage, he does seem to have a rather unforgiving approach.

 As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.
 
 From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians. Personally, I don't see the difference between what is ""good"" and what is ""evil"" when it comes to religion on here. I've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here.
 
 If this is your idea of what is good, I want no part of it.
 
 As far as the two, secular rights and religious rights, it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it, faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid...what's the point in that?","I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.
 I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. 
 Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. 
 It's easier that way.",2

"16501","Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD
 An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe, where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 (beginning in Denmark), there is a correlation between same-sex marriage (or civil unions) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.
 
 In ""Forsaking All Others? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage' on Risky Sex,"" Thomas S. Dee writes:
 
 One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals. A specific implication of this claim is that ""gay marriage"" will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In this study, I present a simple 2-period model, which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce (or increase) the prevalence of STI. Then, I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates. These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe, where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989. The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates. However, these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV. [from the paper's abstract]
 
 Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project. He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books, including No Child Left Behind?: The Politics and Practice of School Accountability, Developments in School Finance, and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths.
 
 Dee's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships:
 
 These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce, perhaps dramatically, the social costs associated with STI like syphilis. In the United States, over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 (CDC 2004b). And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $1 billion, which reflects in large part, the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV (CDC 1999). However, the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health. For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage, these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships.
 
 
 The full paper provides extensive economic analysis, including charts and graphs, and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept.

 Neff's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate, a logjam in part due to Brownback's questions about Neff's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination.
 
 Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment, said Chris Bockheim, her judicial assistant.
 
 Earlier this month, Brownback, a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008, said he would lift the hold he put on Neff's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions.

 Vermont legalizes gay marriage
 The Associated Press
 
 6:57 PM CDT, April 7, 2009
 
 MONTPELIER, Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber.
 
 ""We haven't decided who's going to propose to who yet,"" former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner, Chuck Kletecka. ""But we've been together 25 years in September, and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day.""
 
 ""Sounds good to me,"" Kletecka replied. ""I accept.""
 
 The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill.
 
 Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000. It jumped to the lead again Tuesday: After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage, Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own.
 
 Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire, Maine, New York and New Jersey. The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut, Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts, not their legislatures.
 
 ""For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process"" because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November, said Eric Davis, a retired Middlebury College political science professor.
 
 Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law. While legislatures debate some of the same principles, the process may become much more personal. In Vermont, some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories.
 
 Getting gay marriage approved in a political, rather than purely legal, forum is a big step, said Boston University law professor Linda McLain, an expert on family law and policy.
 
 ""What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it,"" she said.
 
 She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere.
 
 Opponents said they, too, believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state. The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional.
 
 ""To the millions of Americans who care about marriage, we say, 'Get ready. President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act,'"" said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage, which waged a radio campaign against the measure. ""The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states.""
 
 To date, the same-sex marriage movement's main gains have been in New England, which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000.
 
 Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago, saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues.
 
 In Tuesday's vote, a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor's veto. The goal was easily achieved in the Senate, which voted 23-5, but in the House the vote was much closer, 100-49.
 
 The speaker's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature.
 
 Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis, who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992.
 
 ""It's been almost 20 years to get to this point,"" Dostis said. ""I think finally, most people in Vermont understand that we're a couple like any other couple. We're as good and as bad as any other group of people.""
 
 Craig Bensen, a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question, said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1.
 
 ""The other side had a highly funded, extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen,"" he said. ""The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding.""
 
 The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday. But some changed their votes Tuesday.
 
 Rep. Jeff Young, D- St. Albans, who voted no twice because he's philosophically opposed to gay marriage, joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas' veto.
 
 ""I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective, I had to vote with my caucus,"" he said. ""You have some pet projects, you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen. I want to get a railroading bill through. I wouldn't even have had a chance to testify, let alone get it through. Now, people will listen to me. It's the way the political game is played.""

"71931","It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation. The belief that the ""sanctity of marriage"" would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better identifies the source of the opposition. Whether expressly or impliedly, much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained- even fundamental-religious belief.
 
 Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage. As demonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31
 
 This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa's same-sex marriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (""The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .""). The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, ""Marriage is a civil contract"" and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code § 595A.1. Thus, in pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage.

 Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108. Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples, while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various religions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108-09.","Wise words!",2

Election day saw a sweeping repudiation of legally sanctioned same sex marriage in 11 different states, including relatively progressive Oregon. This follows similiar votes for amendments defining marriage in California and Missouri. What does this all mean? Well, for starters, it indicates that a federal marriage amendment has a fighting chance. It should remind us that sanctioning gay nuptials hasn't one thing to do with the oval office occupant.
 It is well known, or should be known, that the process for amending the constitution does not involve the President.
 
 The Amendment Process
 
 There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how it can be amended. One has never been used.
 
 The first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).
 
 The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.
 
 Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken, the amendment must be approved by three-fourths of states. The amendment as passed may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention. See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention. Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default. Only one amendment, the 21st, specified a convention. In any case, passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority.
 
 It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process (though he would be free to make his opinion known). He cannot veto an amendment proposal, nor a ratification.
 
 In spite of this, opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal. Apparently, it's easier to identify a single scapegoat or hold up an unworthy strawman for condemnation than it is to recognize that there is an overriding public sentiment against alternative lifestyles being officially sanctioned.","I've seen people (on TV:)) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment. Don't ask me how they figure this. It's just what they were saying.",2

You won't achieve anything trying to attack straight marriage -- as an institution, the only ones who can undermine it are straight people who choose not to marry. I guess I just can't see the point of this particular thread.","Just wanted to repeat that cause it warranted repeating.",2
"2926","What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.","Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.",2
"904","Yeah, sure your right. Take Ellen for example. It was not too long ago...or perhaps it was (I'm getting old) that she came out of the closet screaming about being gay...and how proud she was to finally be able to say it out loud.","And that's when her career and popularity took a nosedive.

"10032","DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Sen. Sam Brownback, who wants to champion social conservatives in the presidential race, said Tuesday he wants a Senate panel to re-question a judicial nominee who attended a same-sex union ceremony.
 
 Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony, her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases.
 
 Neff's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate, a logjam in part due to Brownback's questions about Neff's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination.
 
 Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment, said Chris Bockheim, her judicial assistant.
 
 Earlier this month, Brownback, a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008, said he would lift the hold he put on Neff's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions.

"1003","DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Sen. Sam Brownback, who wants to champion social conservatives in the presidential race, said Tuesday he wants a Senate panel to re-question a judicial nominee who attended a same-sex union ceremony.
 
 Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony, her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases.
 
 Neff's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate, a logjam in part due to Brownback's questions about Neff's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination.
 
 Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment, said Chris Bockheim, her judicial assistant.
 
 Earlier this month, Brownback, a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008, said he would lift the hold he put on Neff's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions.

If he's the Republican nominee for the presidential election, boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle, not to mention the fact I haven't voted Republican since George W.

 Vermont legalizes gay marriage
 The Associated Press
 
 6:57 PM CDT, April 7, 2009
 
 MONTPELIER, Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber.
 
 ""We haven't decided who's going to propose to who yet,"" former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner, Chuck Kletecka. ""But we've been together 25 years in September, and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day.""
 
 ""Sounds good to me,"" Kletecka replied. ""I accept.""
 
 The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill.
 
 Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000. It jumped to the lead again Tuesday: After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage, Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own.
 
 Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire, Maine, New York and New Jersey. The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut, Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts, not their legislatures.
 
 ""For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process"" because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November, said Eric Davis, a retired Middlebury College political science professor.
 
 Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law. While legislatures debate some of the same principles, the process may become much more personal. In Vermont, some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories.
 
 Getting gay marriage approved in a political, rather than purely legal, forum is a big step, said Boston University law professor Linda McLain, an expert on family law and policy.
 
 ""What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it,"" she said.
 
 She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere.
 
 Opponents said they, too, believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state. The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional.
 
 ""To the millions of Americans who care about marriage, we say, 'Get ready. President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act,'"" said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage, which waged a radio campaign against the measure. ""The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states.""
 
 To date, the same-sex marriage movement's main gains have been in New England, which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000.
 
 Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago, saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues.
 
 In Tuesday's vote, a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor's veto. The goal was easily achieved in the Senate, which voted 23-5, but in the House the vote was much closer, 100-49.
 
 The speaker's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature.
 
 Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis, who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992.
 
 ""It's been almost 20 years to get to this point,"" Dostis said. ""I think finally, most people in Vermont understand that we're a couple like any other couple. We're as good and as bad as any other group of people.""
 
 Craig Bensen, a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question, said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1.
 
 ""The other side had a highly funded, extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen,"" he said. ""The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding.""
 
 The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday. But some changed their votes Tuesday.
 
 Rep. Jeff Young, D- St. Albans, who voted no twice because he's philosophically opposed to gay marriage, joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas' veto.
 
 ""I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective, I had to vote with my caucus,"" he said. ""You have some pet projects, you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen. I want to get a railroading bill through. I wouldn't even have had a chance to testify, let alone get it through. Now, people will listen to me. It's the way the political game is played.""

Also, if the name wasn't important to those like VOR, they would have no problem with gay people using that name of ""marriage"". They know the name marriage carries with it a certain social significance and recognition that civil unions do not. That's why they want gay people to use only the lesser term. They don't want gay people and being gay, to have an equal level of recognition in this society.",2
"7193","It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation. The belief that the ""sanctity of marriage"" would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better identifies the source of the opposition. Whether expressly or impliedly, much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained- even fundamental-religious belief.
 
 Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage. As demonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31
 
 This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa's same-sex marriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (""The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .""). The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, ""Marriage is a civil contract"" and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code § 595A.1. Thus, in pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage.

 Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108. Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples, while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various religions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108-09.","Wise words!",2

"57251","It becomes somewhat irritating to deal with people who's ignorance is matched only by their arrogance. Election day saw a sweeping repudiation of legally sanctioned same sex marriage in 11 different states, including relatively progressive Oregon. This follows similiar votes for amendments defining marriage in California and Missouri. What does this all mean? Well, for starters, it indicates that a federal marriage amendment has a fighting chance. It should remind us that sanctioning gay nuptials hasn't one thing to do with the oval office occupant.
 It is well known, or should be known, that the process for amending the constitution does not involve the President.
 
 The Amendment Process
 
 There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how it can be amended. One has never been used.
 
 The first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).
 
 The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.
 
 Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken, the amendment must be approved by three-fourths of states. The amendment as passed may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention. See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention. Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default. Only one amendment, the 21st, specified a convention. In any case, passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority.
 
 It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process (though he would be free to make his opinion known). He cannot veto an amendment proposal, nor a ratification.
 
 In spite of this, opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal. Apparently, it's easier to identify a single scapegoat or hold up an unworthy strawman for condemnation than it is to recognize that there is an overriding public sentiment against alternative lifestyles being officially sanctioned.","I've seen people (on TV:)) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment. Don't ask me how they figure this. It's just what they were saying.",2
"67741","What new class? This is a silly statement. Too general.","Yes, Joe, I agree. Does this new class apply to the new straight couples as well?",2
"8542","Wow that must really suck for those couples","Well the blame falls to the county for issuing illegal marriage licenses. Such is the price for acting outside the law.",2
"75001","Apparently, you have five questions.
 
 If by 'ability for inward perspective' you imply the ability to look at one's self, it is incongruent to say you are leary of our ability 'to think of life from a gay perspective'. What you are asking is for people to see your troubles from your perspective...hardly possible for many.
 
 Yes. Were I a logical gay man, I would accept the fact that I cannot marry a man due to the definition of marriage. I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples.","You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?",2
"2718","And neither can millions of other heterosexuals, something you ignore. As for nature, technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature. We are a part of nature. Everything we do is a part of nature.

"23511","Same here. I think there may be a few on the fence that choose but most of them are born with the compulsions they have.","I think there are probably more on the fence than there are those who are purely homosexual.
 
 I think many who are 'on the fence' become homophobes to try to deny their idea and attractions. This is characterised by a lot of verbal condemnation with an equal amount of fascination about the sexual activities of Gays.
 
 Their big verbal condemnation is more to convince themselves than to convince others.",2
"68372","No. He is saying that for a person to not look like a complete disgusting hypocrite while arguing against gay marriage on the basis of ""defending Traditional(TM) Marriage"", that person must not engage in behaviours diametrically opposed to said ""Traditional(TM) Marriage"". The strawman you are attempting to construct is just that - a strawman.
 
 
 
 As to ""the majority of Americans are against gay marriage"", who really gives a flying :xcensored? The majority of Americans thought that slavery was acceptable, that blacks and whites shouldn't marry, that ""seperate-but-equal"" policies were acceptable (and equal), that women should not have equal rights as men, that discrimination on the basis of gender, race, etc. was acceptable, and on and on. The ""majority of Americans"" have been for a whole lot of pretty :xcensoreding stupid things. Your argument isn't helped whatsoever with your appeal to majority.","Well said, SP.",2
"2901","Even though the Revision argument may have merit, it is not what the focus should be on. Proponents of marraige equality should be getting the message out that ballot box discrimination is not OK. This is the argument that should be taken to the courts. It should be made clear that civil rights are not a voting matter, and that even if 90% of the people voted to ban gay marriage, targeting a historically vulnerable group and stripping them of a fundamental right is not something that should be put to a vote.
 
 That's what the courts are for, to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.","You make an excellent point, Shooter. 
 
 While I don't feel the ""voter referendum"" idea should be abolished completely, there should be limits as to what should and should not ever be put to a simple majority vote, which I feel is like a state being able to cancel out the republican (little ""r"") concept upon which our country is wisely based and revert to mob rule.
 
 Whatever the majority of a state's populace's preferences or prejudices, they should NOT be allowed to put up for majority vote issues that openly contradict that state's constitution, as interpreted by those they elected in the first place. (I'm speaking California here. I know in some states their Supreme Court judges are appointed--nevertheless, those that appoint them are elected.)
 
 If they want to vote in new judges, fine. New legislature, fine. But once they've voted them in, I don't feel they should be able to go around, gather a few hundred thou signatures, put on the ballot an initiative to negate the rulings, and spend scads of money (mostly from out of state, yet!) to go ""booga booga"" to lie to, mislead and frighten people to overrule the decisions of the people whose legal knowlege and wisdom they voted to abide by in the first place.
 
 This voter initiative thing, at least in my state, is seriously flawed.",2

"82361","What would you rather have your politicans talk about<b></b>: 
 
 Gay marriage and how to ban it, 
 
 or
 
 Securing the borders, nuclear plants, water plants and the country as a whole from terrorist attacks. Properly funding education to ensure that the future generatios are smarter then the previous. State and federal fisical policies and the long term affects on irresponble behavior. Medicare and how it will soon be eating up ever larger portion of state and federal budgets. 
 
 Is anyone else willing to stand with me in declaring that Gay marriage is nothing but a method for politicans to avoid dealing with the real issues?","You know Duo, I actually agree with you here. I think it's a method for BOTH sides to avoid dealing with other issues. For The Democrats, gay rights is a means of tokenism to get some extra votes. For Republicans, it's a way to stir up their base to avoid dealing with unpopular policies.",2

 All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way.","Here in the Midwest, large numbers of diehard black Democrats voted for Kerry and against gay marriage. It truly was a cross-over issue that transcended party politics.",2
"871","I have a question for all those of you who are against same sex marriage. Now this takes some ability for inward perspective, a quality in short supply here sometimes.
 
 Here goes.
 
 Would you be happy to accept what you are asking gay people to accept? Would you want gay people to outlaw your marriages? Would you still support the majority decision if the majority of people were gay and it was heterosexual marriages that were being denied or banned outright? Would you accept civil unions even though they were less then marriage? Would you be happy or find it just that certain religious sects were fighting your civil rights?
 
 I know this is a futile attempt to try and get you all to think of life from a gay perspective.","You know the answer, Matt. They'd never accept it.",2
