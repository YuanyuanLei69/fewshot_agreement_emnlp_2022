"3839","Well, I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed, but I certainly don't think they all would not have been passed, and I don't think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing. Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome, but no one can ever change a law if people aren't willing to take a stand and fight for it.
 
 Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu's signature?","I believe the Congress in Mass is still fighting what their Supreme Court did and I am pretty sure they will be trying to pass and amendment there in the next year...........

"7234","NY Assembly Passes Marriage Equality Bill
 The New York State Assembly just voted to pass the marriage bill by a vote of 85 to 61. The vote comes a bit over a month after Gov. Spitzer introduced the bill into the Legislature and a bit under a year since the NYS Court of Appeals ruled that it&#8217;s the Legislature&#8217;s job to decide on the issue of same-sex marriage.
 It's not likely the GOP senate will pass it, of course, but who knows? Maybe miracles do happen... :)","Don't count on it. Republicans do not believe in equality, individual freedom, or human rights. They only kowtow to their religious right masters. If Republicans trully belived in individual freedom, equality, and human rights the would wholeheartedly support this legislation.",1.4,2
"6444","Who.....really......cares. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's a choice. Stay out of my bedroom and I'll stay out of yours. Don't make my relationship out to be worthless and I won't vote to make divorce illegal.","I don't get why either side thinks it matters much. There is evidence that many, many behaviors we see have genetic roots; including behaviors that are unacceptable to society. It is not like something being genetic necessarily matters one iota in terms of the morality the behavior associated with it. So it's just as strange that some feel proving gay-is-genetic will matter as it is strange that some feel that disproving it will matter. The moral issue of homosexual relations will go on regardless of the genetic debate, because quite frankly, one is not dependent on the other.",1.8,2

These evil fundie christianists can have affairs, 2, 3, 4, or even 5 marriages yet gay people are a threat to marriage by wanting to get married.","You hear that cry...allowing gays to marry will cause the downfall of civilization...but you never hear ""how"" or ""why""?

"2174","Just thought I would ask (for fun), what are your ideas for a same sex wedding ceremony that is not religious and is also not to ""heterosexual"" but is still is a nice ceremony? In other words, what pieces of a ""traditional"" ceremony would you keep and which would you decide are too ""hetero""?
 
 I am sure this question seems bizarre but I thougt that would make it more thought provoking, not to mention I am serious. I am going to have a ceremony and was looking for ideas. Figured you guys might have some at the same time debate the issue of what makes a ceremony or union similar and different.","First off, Congratulations are in order (HUGZ)!
 
 As for a ceremony:
 
 If were to ever get married, I think it would be relatively small (50 to 100 people max) and out in a an open meadow (weather permitting), or at least a lush green park or back yard. My partner and I would escort each other up the aisle in matching grey tuxes, to a simple platform with a white garden archway decorated in white flowers, where a justice of the peace presides over a simple ceremony. We would read vows to one another and then be pronounced partners in life, and then just have a fabulous garden party.

"1294","ADF: NH gov's proposed revisions to marriage redefinition bill fail religious freedom test - Alliance Defense Fund - Defending Our First Liberty
 
 And there it is...
 The repeated demand from the anti-gay for SPECIAL PRIVILEGES for the ""religious"" detractors.
 
 I fully support CHURCHES and PASTORS from being exempt, but it's not necessary.
 Currently, our RELIGIOUS discrimination protection is much stronger than our gay discrimination protection, but do you see churches being forced to perform inter-religion marriage if the church doctrine is against it? NO!
 Do you see atheists saying ""I like the look of this church. I don't belong, but I'm going to force you to rent the church for my wedding party anyways."" ?? NO!
 
 The existing language and constitutional protections are good enough.
 But when given more explicit (redundant) wording, what do the anti-gay marriage organizations demand?
 Something NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD before.
 They want BUSINESS OWNERS to be free to discriminate if they have ""religious objections""...
 What if their objections are NON-religious in nature? Why is the religion supposed to get the special perk???
 
 And as mentioned, NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD this.
 There were plenty of religious interpretations against black equality and interracial marriage. But did we give THEM special privilege to ignore and discriminate against interracial marriages?
 NO!
 
 The really refreshing part of all this?
 These whiny temper tantrums just don't matter... emoticon_rolleyes
 If the NH legislature includes the religious exceptions (if they are just reconfirming that churches / pastors don't have to perform ceremonies they don't want to), then the governor WILL sign it.","This all comes down to fear of retribution from gay people. They know that they have been the leading cause of our oppression, they know that the tide and culture is turning in our favor. Sometimes the oppressor finds in a minority it oppress a mirror of itself. They think it is right to oppress us and see can not see that we have no interest in oppressing them or even revenge for the oppression.",2,2
"1387","Many who voted for this said as much. They're hoping that in a few years gays will actually get full rights. We can only hope.","That's good. You're right, all we can do is hope and pray (I pray for things like this every day, and in a way, God has answered my prayer in this case).",2,2
