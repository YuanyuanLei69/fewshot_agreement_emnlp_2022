"5175","By the same logic many economists use, we could find any number of absurd things. For example there is a well known correlation between skyscraper construction and economic downturn, we could conclude from this that tall buildings depress economies and that recessions can be avoided if we disallow the construction of record-height buildings.
 
 The other thing economists need to realise is that economic statistics are entirely historical, they provide empirical information about a particular group at a particular time, not universal truths about mankinds' behaviour in general. Even if we run an experimental design in the realm of human action showing X causes Y, differing social and cultural norms may result in the precise opposite effect at another period of time.","So, the cavaet is ""The death penalty is a deterrent in the USA TODAY!""

 It's reasons like this I'm glad we left the UK. When you threaten to rape and murder and entire family, and you're in less trouble than the person you threatened, that's not a sign of the country being safe or worth living in; especially when this is the rule and not the exception.","You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured.

 ...","This may be true for a case that hasn't already been decided. It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials. However, his trial is over.
 
 Now that we've been through the expensive trial, we've yet to go through the expensive appeals after the sentencing. After we get through that, if he still retains the death penalty, it's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison. The latest estimate I've heard for keeping a prisoner alive is between 50 and 75 thousand dollars a year.
