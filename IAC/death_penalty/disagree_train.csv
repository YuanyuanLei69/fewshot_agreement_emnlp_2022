"258","It actually saves us money. The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again. Also I have the same question for drug users, gamblers, etc. Why make society pay to imprison them when all they are doing is hurt themselves?","Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times. The lowest estimate of the yearly cost for imprisoning somebody is around $22,000. The average amount of time a prisoner spends imprisoned after getting a life sentence is 60 years. Take into account the cost of building jails in order to house all these prisoners and you up the amount even more. After the average of 60 years for a life sentence, tax payers have spent $1,320,000 on ONE SINGLE PERSON. Imagine what this money could do in the education system? You said yourself, the only thing that may push the cost of the death penalty over life imprisonment is the ridiculous amount of appeals that are given. If only one appeal was given before the sentence was final, it would be far cheaper to exectue somebody than imprison them for life. How many times does a person need to prove their innocence? If they can't do it in the initial trial and after one appeal, sorry, game over...you lose. You can read more at this site:

"4255","Here is a link about people who were released prior to the death penalty due to being shown to be innocent (124 people since 1973). It also lists at least seven people who were executed despite strong doubts about their guilt. Of course, it is difficult to officially prove innocence after death since there are no criminal court proceedings for the dead.
 
 http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&scid=6","So again, this points to the fact that the appeals system is effective at preventing ""innocent"" people from being executed? I had asked for 5 examples of innocent people who were executed. Chemist99a stated that ""we execute too many innocent people"". Someone has yet to give me 5 examples of innocents that we have executed. 
 
 And by the way: The information about the seven ""potentially innocent"" people that have been executed is quite laughable in some cases.",0
"1880","If human life is an absolute value than how can you allow serial killers to remain a threat to others by NOT executing them?emoticon_confused","Well, because the value of that life doesn't depend on what the perosn does, it is independent from that. I want to protect human life, that's why murderers go to jail, but I can't kill a person as penalty because I deny that very desire to protect life.
 
 WhatÂ¡s the difference, then, between the state killing a crimminal that has been condemned by a court, and me going to a jail and doing it myself? Should I be put in jail? Wasn't I performing justice?",0
"7344","He should be killed straight away. Henry VIII would have no problem with lopping off his head! Neither would I.","You know, you and Saddam may have more in common than you might have thought.
 
 But really, I think they may be on to something with Sharia Law. If you steal, they cut off your hand. Pretty good deterent. If you do drugs they execute you. If you commit adultery they stone you to death. But Saddam thought that Sharia law was too harsh to be used in general practice.",0
"7146","""If it doesn't submit to you peacefully then you shall besiege it...and put all it's males to the sword...and take the women and children as you spoils."" - Deut. 20:12 - Love your enemies????","Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars. Sorry, just doesn't work that way.",0
"4765","Would you agree if the death penalty was banned?","No, for the reasons stated above and one more. Some people don't deserve to live....like SH, for example.",0
"8450","The death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else. In prison, the criminal could a) kill another inmate, 2) kill a guard, 3) escape and kill a civilian, 4) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime.","Well, it also deprives that person of rethinking their life, and maybe become a missionary for children in Afirca or something. You cannot judge a man's life on what he has done, you can judge him about those acts, but not his entire life.
 
 The death penalty is a contradictory measure. On one side, we say we want to protect the value of human life by putting murderers in jail, but on the other, we show utter contempt for that same value. How can you say you are protecting the life of your citizens (because you value it), while at the same time you end someone else's life. This is absurd.",0
"7622","Sorry Jo. Here in the US if an intruder comes into your house, you don't have to get a lawyer and spend your life's saving proving that you aren't the criminal. Here, we pay the $100 to have the blood removed from the carpet, let the coroner carry out the body and move on. emoticon_xkill","And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing. I'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed.",0
"6569","You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.","You know what is far worse than not executing murderers? Letting 'em sit around, watch tv, and eat pizza. ;\

"622","I made the same mistake.","No, this is not about abortion, and I think that is very clear. If I wanted to discuss abortion, then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there.
 
 The point about abortion that I brought up is that it questions the premise offered by thelmoose with respect to juvenile development. In fact, this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders.
 
 On the one hand, it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to have the same right to abortion as an adult, but on the other hand, it is argued that they do not posses enough moral maturity to be able to be held to the same standard as adults when it comes to the decision to commit cold blooded murder.
 
 For your convenience, I underlined the key parts. We have here two contradictory statements. That is what I was pointing out.",0
"3140","So much safer.","So it's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you're late at turning in your homework?
 
 Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.
 
 But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm.",0
"4789","Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a ""perfect"" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before.","Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.",0
"7912","We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.","Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the ""18 and over execution rule"" in the eighth amendment.",0
"3948","After the person's case is thoroughly investigated, and they are guilty, the death penalty should stay","But the problem is with determining whether or not a person ACTUALLY is guilty. If we could determine 100% for sure whether or not a person is guilty, I would definitely be pro-death penalty. However, I don't think it is worth the risk to sacrifice one innocent life in order to punish others.",0
"2234","I don't agree with capital punishment because I believe all people have a right to life but I have to agree that the greater punishment for criminals is to keep them alive. Death is quick and easy, a life forced to live with what you have done is far greater punishment. Let them rot in a cage for the rest of their natural lives.","But if a loved one were murdered for simply protecting his/her family, what would life in prison do for justice? For you? For the low-life - but maybe get him paroled for some pacified, gutless reason/excuse?",0
