"6369","Why do we need doctors for this anyway?","Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.
 
 Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.
 
 He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)",1
"3678","Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?","Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.",1
"5981","Nope. There really isn't.
 
 100%","so thats quite contradictory to me... you would allow a law that killls millions of innocent babies a year
 
 and
 
 get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law... wierd sounds like a liberal to me.",1
"5167","I have had some experience with this topic...
 My father was murdered when I was 12, the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death..
 flash forward 24 years
 He ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine. His lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with ""retardation""
 Mind you he ""walked"" 3 times.. all of which I was there to witness. I was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. Back to the drawing table.. Last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his IQ test. The limit for the death penalty is 70. He was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. So now he is off death row, and the DA has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty. I have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. I do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say I am too close to the matter. But I did feel let down when they took him off death row, now I feel like there will never be justice. I put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as I dreaded witnessing it, I also looked forward to it.
 I do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful....
 but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be I should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure I could do it.
 so with all that I still don't really know if I in my heart, support the death penalty or I am just after revenge.
 The victims of violence I would imagine go through this struggle.
 Side note... the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor... he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in.. and it was several years later when he killed my dad.","So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!
 
 If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.
 
 There are some who need to be put to death.
 
 Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.
 
 If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself.",1
"3208","I don't under stand this one. I think you are saying that a ""death penalty"" trial costs too much? See comments for #1","yes, and it is also a complex train of economics leading down all the way to your door.",1
"5821","How is that a affect of deterrence? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences. A dead man has no fears. 
 
 Furman Vs. Georgia, where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent.","--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison.",1
"4389","Illinois just allowed 167 death row inmates released from death row. Just in case one of them might not be guilty. I say, what about the other 166 that are guilty?","Just so you know Peach, the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison. At least that one who's not guilty might now have a chance to be free.",1
"9101","It deals with the death penalty...really the court is one vote away from getting rid of it because some liberal judges don't like it.","I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.",1
"6085","You don't mean Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, do you? The Russian spies? Nah, you said wrongfully accused.....","Yes, I mean the couple who was wrongly accused of being Russian spies in the 50's and then exicuted. This was stupid for at least two reasons. One, they weren't spies. Back about 5 years ago, they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them. Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an idiot and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.
 
 
 Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves.",1
"6573","Can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual?
 
 Put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime?
 
 Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional. This has been the case from the beginning of our Republic, and has been reaffirmed multiple times. In other words, it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty, in general, is unconstitutional. That has neither been the case through our history, and is not the current state of the law.
 
 *Note: I am speaking within the context of the United States, and its Constitution.","I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.",1
"8704","It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.","Yes, we should have a speedier route to the needle. If we miss a few, send a few innocent people to their deaths, no harm no foul.",1
"8495","When that occurs is variable.","So why cannot juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis? Under the theory of variable neurophysiological development, we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding, and also some individuals 18 and over who do not.",1
"7659","If you have a position please share it. No need to start new threads as some sort of news service.","Well, the Vatican taking a proper moral stand is so rare and note worthy.",1
"1414","While anyone can accept that a ""perfect"" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to ""get revenge.""","And again:",1
"5922","Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals. Cost has nothing to do with it for me.","Well, why do you support it?",1
