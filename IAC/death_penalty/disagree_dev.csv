"3233","This may be true for a case that hasn't already been decided. It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials. However, his trial is over.","Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.",-3.5,0
"9013","""If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother...they shall take him to the gates of that town...and all the men of the town shall stone him."" - Deut. 21:18","Amazing how you simply took out the parts of the verse that didn't support your arguement. ""If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, ""This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard."" Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid."" Profligate:completely given up to dissipation and licentiousness. Licentiousness:lacking legal or moral restraints; especially : disregarding sexual restraints",-2,0
"6927","There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis.","What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?
 
 Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?",-2.6,0
"497","I don't know what exactly to think of it only I think it saves us the cost of prisons!","No it doesn't!
 
 It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.
 It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.",-3.6,0
"6090","With enough of a population size, you can check the effects of dozens of variables at once.","You can check the statistical relationship between dozens of variables, not the effects of them.
 
 For example if I correlated left hand strength with right hand strength across a billion individuals I would probably find a correlation of about 0.93, however this relationship is not causal, cutting off one hand will not result in a 90% strength reduction in the other.
 
 Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect.",-2.4,0
"8933","I agree entirely. Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.","So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?",-1.14285714286,0
"5153","""No one who's testicles are crushed or who's penis is cut off shall enter the house of the lord."" - Deut. 23:1","I'm sorry, but that's not what my version said.
 ""No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD ."" Emasculated = castrated Emasculation was not an accident. (What this verse has to do with the death penalty is beyond me.)",-2.83333333333,0
"5038","the death penalty works.
 
 No convicted fellon excecuted by the state of Texas has evr gone on to kill again.","Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)). 
 
 Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma√ïs Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998)).",-1.4,0
"6517","--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison.","How is that related to deterrence? 
 
 Once again, deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences.
 
 What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence.",-3.14285714286,0
"6464","I don't know what exactly to think of it only I think it saves us the cost of prisons!","I would favor capital punishment IF our system was always fair and equal, it is not ..... would O.J. have walked if he had been a poor man? I would support capital punishment if we only convicted guilty men ... that is not the case. The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing, and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death. To me the harshest punishment would be to wake up knowing that this day would be like yesterday and tomorrow will be like today - for the rest of my life. Anyone who has had surgery can tell you that being put to sleep with chemicals is absolutely painless. Deterrent? Do states with the death penalty have a lower murder per capita than those that do? From a fiscal standpoint, it is cheaper to keep the convicted in prison for life than it is to execute them, and a whole lot easier to correct an error. Will we continue to have state sanctioned revenge? Probably.

"129","""If it (the town) accepts your terms of peace and surrender, then all of its inhabitants shall serve you inslavery."" - Deut. 20:11","Read the entire verse and don't edit out parts of it.""When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city."" Hmmmm...death or slavery. Wow, that's a hard choice.",-2,0
"6324","I don't care much either way, as long as he never walks around loose again. But life in prison is going to cost the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. That money could be better spent in the war on terror.","First of all, death penalty cases usually cost more than keeping a prisoner alive for his life.
