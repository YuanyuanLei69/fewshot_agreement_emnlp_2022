 Meanwhile, I drank a fifth of Tequila last night. Perfectly acceptable. Nothing wrong with it.","Does this seem a little ironic to anyone else? Either becoming intoxicated is acceptable or it isn't, why does the method make one acceptable and practitioners of the other ""losers""?

"4867","What? Are you trying to claim that marijuana slows the progress of cancer? Or did you mean.","Actually it's funny. Mice deprived of THC (it naturally occurs in the brain) are smarter than regular mice, but die much earlier. Not because of cancer, but of ""natural"" causes. It wouldn't be hugely surprising if THC supplements made you live longer, albeit at a lower level of intelligence, even if the smoking aspect of taking it had negative effects that counterbalanced that.",1
"5768","While I agree with the law, I don't agree with your reason. By your logic we should just dump all laws as someone is always willing to break them.
 
 The reason to me is the great number of people who do it. The society itself has changed. The laws should be changed to reflect that. 
 
 Up here in VT, something like 55% of all residents admit to smoking marijuana on a regular basis. It still illegal, but people don't report marijuana usage and cops don't arrest people for it unless they a near a school or have enough to charge them with intent to distribute.","I think the reason for the law would be that there's no reeason to have the ban in the first place (ok, no GOOD reason).",1

 I guess so, since I'm trying to explain why it's silly for it to be illegal.
 But, guess what, you are rationalizing why beer is legal.
 And you're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years. 
 Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off.
 But you and I both know that all this depends on the person.
 
 If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day.
 There you go...
 If weed is good enough, one or two tokes is all you need.
 You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you didn't tax your liver with alcohol. (You also didn't tax your kidneys and GI tract with caffiene.)

 Good lord, let's all go watch Reefer Madness everyone.
 
 Please, explain how you ""lost"" these friends ""to weed.""
 If your friend of a friend got his head blown off, that had everything to do with it being ILLEGAL...
 
 But really dude, you're making this up anyway and it's silly.",1
"8112","Well, I don't work with any ""reefer heads"" or pot smokers now...this was awhile back.","Sure about that?",1
"5576","Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.
 
 I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.
 
 You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.
 
 One ""benefit"" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.","Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.",1
