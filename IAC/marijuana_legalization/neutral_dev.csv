"2641","Heh? That's news to me. Most potheads I know smoke in parks, while heroin/cocaine addicts don't use their drugs in public for somewhat obvious reasons.","Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.",-0.428571428571,1
"6676","You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.","Holland hasn't legalised, its decriminalized. This allows drugs to remain in the hands of the dealers, keeping prices high. We need full legalization.
 
 The quantity of alcohol use rose during the Prohibition. Not proof that legalising drugs would cut use, but certainly a reason not to assume they'd rocket.",0.666666666667,1
"5322","Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s. The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the ""success of the war on drugs.""","Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers.",-0.75,1

"2981","Then a marijuana addict will rationalize his/her behavior by saying things like ""well atleast I don't do herion""...thats like a theft saying ""atleast I don't steal at gunpoint""...i mean you are still stealing.","He he, I guess I would definitely consider myself a weed addict. emoticon_xclown 
 Although, the addiction is more psychological than physical.
 If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so, you get really pissy and irritable, but that's about it.
 But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it, they just do it cuz they like it, nothing too complicated about it.",0.166666666667,1
"2238","I'm about as far right as you can get politically. So far right that I don't believe that the government has any grounds for regulating substances that we want to ingest, smoke, snort or inject. Where I differ from those on the Left is I don't feel compelled to help the druggies who get themselves in over their heads. To me, if you jump in a lake with weights around your ankles, don't expect me to jump in after you. Want to spend your life stoned, fine. Just don't expect me to pay your medical bills when you get sick. ""Die ****er!"" As Scrooge once quipped ""better to die and decrease the surplus population."" :)","Idealy this MIGHT not be a bad solution...however, the risks to everyone else and the pain it would cause the rest of society would probably be greater.",-0.5,1
"6760","Wrong, the muder rate has been cut substantially since the 1980s. There has been a steady decline in the US for violent crime over the last 25 years.

 Some facts for those interested in what a failure law enforcement has been. Direct numbers. Showing that both numbers and per capita rates have declined steadily for the last 10 to 15 years. Hardly an indication of anything being a failure or not working frankly.","Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s.
