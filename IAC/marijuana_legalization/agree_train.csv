"5460","Hemp could save our nation's economy if that bastard William Randolph Hearst hadn't made it illegal because he wanted to make millions from paper manufactured from tree pulp","Actually, had hemp and marijuana been legal and cultivated widely in this country since 1937, it would have tanked along with the rest of our economy. Right now as an outside industry looking in, it has the potential to generate billions of dollars in California alone. The taxes generated alone from the sale of marijuana could be massive. 
 
 The Obama administration has made clear that it is no longer going to support the practice of raiding so called cannabis clubs in California, where ""medical"" marijuana is dispensed. Many in California want to take it a step beyond, and move towards decriminalization and regulation of cannabis in the same way we regulate alcohol. 
 
 Will the federal government step in and stop this, or are they going to actually do the constitutional thing and support state's rights to make and enforce their own laws? Will the federal government consider amendment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970?",2

"17791","I say legalize pot and tax the hell out of it. Why should us alcoholics have to pay all the sin taxes?","There are biliions of dollars to be made from the taxation of marjuana. Institutions like The DEA and the state and federal prison systems would see fincncial stress relieved from them. Its also a realistic way to increase revenue to lower the deficit
