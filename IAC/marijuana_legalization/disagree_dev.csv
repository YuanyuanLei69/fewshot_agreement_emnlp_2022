 I'm not sure how a stoner's worse than an alcoholic really.
 
 -Wez","Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.
 
 Stoner is not good, alcoholic is not good, herion addict is not good. You ask if I have evidence...yes, my own two eyes. Don't believe me then so be it, but there are many articles that say the effects of marijuana...at the very least it is like smoking. I stress very least.",-2,0
"7519","The marijuana addict will work, buy weed, smoke it, work to buy more. AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff. Now you do crack...then herion...then you are dead. Good job stupid junky.","Yeah, see this is the old ""gateway drug"" fallacy.
 If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?
 If a drug can act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?
 So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something ""harder""? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.",-4.2,0

"2235","You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.
 
 Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.","First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.",-2.8,0

So when will YOU grow up?","Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda.",-3.5,0
"2827","I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like ""Marijuana will kill you."" Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.
 I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.","You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category.

"2656","Wez it doesn't matter whether they are legal or not. You can still get them. If keeping them illegal has worked at all I would say go for it, but it hasn't. If I want a drug I can get a drug in about an hour. The same goes for any of you.","Legalising them would increase use however. Most people can't get hard drugs easily. If they get hard drugs at all, it's still a lot harder to get hard drugs, than say alcohol.
 
 Then there's the risk factor. Most people aren't willing to take that and risk becoming embroiled with dealers.
 
 I don't particularly want an increase in hard drug use.
