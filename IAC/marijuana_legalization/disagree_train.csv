"8406","I'm sure you've been high on marijuana before. And when you're high, you're too ignorant and doped up to know that it's the marijuana that's making you act like a XXXXX.","And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?",0
"5950","[*]Smoking tobacco is quite unhealthy even without pesticides.","Oh, really? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants? NO.",0
"6025","He was probably an idiot to begin with then.","Actually he wasnt or I wouldn't have used that example.",0
"6021","Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.","If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption).",0
"7457","Should it be legalized? Absolutely not. 
 Is it harmful? Excessively.
 Should it be taxed once legalized? Heavily; at least five times what the purchase price is.
 Should laws still aply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Without question.","How is marijuana ""excessively harmful""? Please define ""excessively"". Do you consider marijuana more harmful than alcohol? 
 
 And, why would you want it to cost 5X the normal purchase price? Wouldn't that just encourage people to continue to buy it one the street where it would still be readily available and significantly cheaper? 
 
 As for the rest of your post...seriously...grow up.",0

 NOW YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK HERE DUDE.
 I'm sure there are some people that deal all kinds of things, but someone who regularly sells pot pretty much only sells pot. I'm not saying 100%of the time, but pot smokers don't go into some ghetto crackhouse to get their pot.
 Jesus, man, are you that out of touch?","No, I think that he's right on target. The drug dealers that are caught here in Michigan usually get caught with weed AND more hardcore drugs. Theyy're ""full service"" dealers. Weed is a gateway drug, you know. :)",0
"7077","Not a coincidence, just a stupid population to look at to understand whether marijuana does or does not lead to ""harder"" drugs. And the word of some guy you heard about is how you draw conclusions?","Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?",0
"5991","As for marijuana being bad for you..you sound like my friend who is a pot head. Let me be the first to say (since I know way to many weed addicts...side effect of liking DMB I guess) marijuana does do more damage then one might think. It WILL make you an idiot if you are a chronic user.","Come on, it won't make you an idiot.
 It will make you a lazy, forgetful slob if you let it.
 Nobody's saying that marijuana is health food, they're just saying as a drug it's no worse than certain currently legal drugs.",0
"7459","I can agree with legalizing Marijuana, but it is very similar to alcohol. Your reaction time is slowed down considerably. Before being legalized, there needs to be a test, similar to the BAC test. It shouldn't be illegal to smoke marijuana, but it should be the same as alcohol; you can't smoke and drive.","But you can drink and drive, you just cannot be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive. There is no test possible in the field (like a breathylizer used for alcohol) that would allow for testing of THC levels. It should be like anything else, if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment, you get detained and taken for further testing, which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab. And since you bring it up, marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol. Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC.",0
"5692","And your argument is not a good one. If I said ""this food is bad because it's poisonous, so lets use this one and add poison to it."" Does that make any sense? NO.","Actually, your argument makes no sense. It's not the pesticides used on the tobacco crop that makes it harmful, it's the chemicals they add to the tobacco to make the smoke more palatable. Your whole point here is moot.",0
