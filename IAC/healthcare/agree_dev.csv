 What you really are saying is that the safety nets in place are not sufficient, because they do exist. Millions of Americans do not have health insurance, but that does not mean they do not have access to medical care. Could the available resources cover more services, be easier to access and be provided with higher quality, yes without question. EMT's don't ask for proof of insurance before you get on the ambulance. They may take someone to a certain ER, but they get in. Many states have medical services for children and pregnant women. Seniors and disabled have Social Security and Medi-Care along with many other health and social services at the State and Federal level. None of which existed 100 years ago. Not bad considering the country is only 234 years old. Some countries have better health services, some better education opportunities, some overall quality of life, but none rank as high as we do having the freedom and population that we do. 
 
 Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is no statement with regards to the quality of that life, that we have freedom to do as we please or that happiness will be acquired. This statement means your life is protected from being taken unjustly (but it happens) we are protected from being unjustly detained (but it happens and is different than freedom) and that unjust are not restrictions are placed on us. The DOI is concerned with the unfair treatment of the people by government. Stating that the government should be and is obligated to the interests of the governed. We the governed forget that our government is supposed to be the collective voice of those being represented. 
 
 Who and how is the standard of care to be determined? Do we restrict the pursuit of happiness because certain activities are more likely to require use of resources? Do we mandate preventative care to better manage limited resources? Does this apply to all people or just citizens? Here illegally or legally, but not a citizen?
 
 The desire is noble, the reality imposing, the solution unknown but the the fight worthwhile. Those who choose to participate in the government that governs them, will many times feel frustrated and disappointed, but will always have the potential for their voice to be heard amid the deafening silence of the uncaring masses","And yet it is the will of the people that must voice this moral obligation. I feel that bitter politics upon both sides has cast a dark cloud over any sort of serious debate over the matter. It is seen more of as a democratic potential victory or a republican loss than the real meaning behind such legislation which is to improve the quality of life among our citizens.
 
 More often than not issues that become important and even dire to our nations well being are simply twisted into political capital rather than seen as an improvement for the common good of all people.",1.16666666667,2
