 A bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on Christmas eve.
 
 Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government, yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new ""manager's amendment"" that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations. Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what's in it, not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning. After procedural motions that allow for no amendments, the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24.
 Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce.
 
 The rushed, secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that ""reform"" has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state. An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it, as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week. The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open, and clean up the mess later.
 ***
 &#8226; Health costs. From the outset, the White House's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses, and they're sticking to that story. ""Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn't read the bills,"" Mr. Obama said over the weekend. This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it.
 The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer WellPoint, which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill. WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178%. A small business based in Richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23% increase. Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family with two kids living in Indianapolis will pay 106% more. And on and on. 
 These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare&#8212;above and far beyond the status quo&#8212;because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would distort insurance markets. All but a handful of states have rejected regulations like ""community rating"" because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care, increasing costs for everyone. Benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics.
 As for the White House's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed ""waste,"" even Victor Fuchs, an eminent economist generally supportive of ObamaCare, warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic. ""The oft-heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice,"" the Stanford professor wrote.
 
 &#8226; Steep declines in choice and quality. This is all of a piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the $33 trillion the U.S. will spend on medicine over the next decade should go.
 This centralized system means above all fewer choices; what works for the political class must work for everyone. With formerly private insurers converted into public utilities, for instance, they'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost-conscious decisions.
 Unnoticed by the press corps, the Congressional Budget Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so ""substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types, prices, and number of private sellers of health insurance"" that companies like WellPoint might need to ""be considered part of the federal budget.""
 With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in Washington's hands, quality will decline. Ultimately, ""our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all,"" as Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages. Take the $2 billion annual tax&#8212;rising to $3 billion in 2018&#8212;that will be leveled against medical device makers, among the most innovative U.S. industries. Democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-coated stents are driving costs too high, though patients and their physicians might disagree. 
 ""The Senate isn't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day,"" Brent Eastman, the chairman of the American College of Surgeons, said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing ObamaCare. For no other reason than ideological animus, doctor-owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they're allowed to treat. Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare will ""destroy over 200 of America's best and safest hospitals.""
 
 &#8226; Blowing up the federal fisc. Even though Medicare's unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008, Democrats are crowing that ObamaCare will cost ""only"" $871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $132 billion, according to CBO. Yet some 98% of the total cost comes after 2014&#8212;remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week&#8212;and most of the taxes start in 2010. That includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than $200,000 that rose to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid's final machinations.
 
 Job creation, here we come.
 Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but doesn't start paying benefits until late in the decade. But the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5% next year and deeper after that. Everyone knows the payment cuts won't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower. The American Medical Association's priority was eliminating this ""sustainable growth rate"" but all they got in return for their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend.
 The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic. To hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet, the Senate sets up government-run ""exchanges"" that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400% of the poverty level, or $96,000 for a family of four in 2016. Supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers don't provide insurance or work for small businesses.
 
 As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute points out, this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation&#8212;whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits&#8212;very differently. Under the Senate bill, someone who earned $42,000 would get $5,749 from the current tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $12,750 in the exchange. A worker making $60,000 would get $8,310 in the exchanges but only $3,758 in the current system.
 
 For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill is not just a new health system but also ""a new welfare and tax system"" that will warp the labor market. Given the incentives of these two-tier subsidies, employers with large numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert them into ""contractors"" or do more outsourcing. As more and more people flood into ""free"" health care, taxpayer costs will explode.

 This past weekend I went to the hospital after injuring myself in a race. From the door to triage: 2 minutes. Triage to admission: 10 minutes. Examined, treated, and discharged within 30 minutes. Discussion of payment: 0.
 
 Never in my life have I had difficulty in seeing any doctor I wanted to, nor have my friends or family members. 
 
 All this for far less expenditure per gdp than the US.","Well, my daughter cut her chin (in the U.S.), which required some stitches. My wife arrived to the emergency room with my daughter around 6:30 PM. We did not come back home until after midnight.",2
"98052","I still do not understand what these people are demonstrating for or against. Are they demonstarting for being dropped in the middle of cancer treatement? Are they demonstrating for being denied coverage due to pre-existing condition? Are they demonstrating for increasing healthcare costs? Are they demonstrating for keeping 50 million people uninsured?","I know what you mean. I also wonder how they think their children or grandchildren will be paying for their medical bills.
 
 Note, by way of comparison, this Pittsburgh local t.v. clip of the September 20th March for Jobs (part of Healthcare Justice Week, this week). See how clearly and intelligently the protesters articulate their objectives, and without the disgraceful display of blind malice we have otherwise witnessed from the teabaggers:

"21881","It is the ""per capita"" that is important. We are not going to be saving any money on a cash flow basis. In theory we are going to be treating more people for the same money. Essentially the goal is a gain in efficiency.
 
 The problem I am seeing is that so far I have not seen anything in the bill that really touches on waste in our health care system. I have used this example before. A while back I injured my ankle. I went to the doctor to get it checked even though I was fairly certain it was just sprained. He agreed that it was probably just sprained, but sent me down for an MRI just to be sure. 
 
 Why a $3000 MRI instead of a $70 X-ray? I don't know, and when I asked him, he did not really seem to know. The MRI gives better detail, but in checking for broken bones that is not really a consideration. He said that was just the protocol they use now. 
 
 If we want o0ur health care system to work for everybody at a reasonable price, inefficiencies like that need to stop. The price of prescription drugs needs to be brought down and the American people need to be educated enough to understand that the ""need money for research"" excuse that the drug companies use to explain away their 2000% markups is BS....over 80% of medical research for new prescription drugs in this country is ALREADY funded by taxpayer dollars through NIH grants. Using the cost of that research...which we already paid for...to justify a 2000% markup is insane. 
 
 We need to remove medical exemptions from anti-racketeering and price fixing laws. We need to overhaul our horribly outdated patent system when it comes to drug formulations and medical devices. 
 
 The new bill does not do any of that....at least not the parts I have seen. The new bill basically focuses on getting more people insured and putting more money in the insurance companies pockets. While we may see a slight efficiency gain from increased preventative care, I dont think the savings will be enough to come anywhere close to ""fixing"" the system.","So in short the best case scenario is we go from $6,000 per capita to.......$6,000 per capita. Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well, some of them. 
 
 This seems optimistic to me.",2
"2454","I'm really not so sure about Obama's healthcare plan, when I read it it seems kind of wishy-washy...# like what does ""Reform the insurance market to increase competition by taking on anticompetitive activity that drives up prices without improving quality of care."" actually mean?# In practice?# 
 
 I'm more interested in the Health Care for America plan more, it&#8217;s a proposal put together by the political scientist Jacob Hacker with the support of the Economic Policy Institute. I&#8217;d suggest reading Thinking Big to get a better idea of the plan, but the basic idea is that employers pay money into a public fund, enough to cover their workers.# The public fund should have quality coverage for all, including preventive care.# Workers get to choose - keep your insurance, choose a different private plan, or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman, pick your healthcare providers and doctors.# Employers choose too. Those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost.# HCFA and Medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population. So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans, and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom, the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency, improving quality and cutting costs, even in the private insurance plans.# The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog.# What do you think?","I think you are on to something.
 
 The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.
 
 Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.",2

 5. Payment to doctors for Medicare patients will decrease 21.5% next year and more after that. How many doctors do you think will continue to treat Medicare patients when that happens?
 6. The plan will cost $871Billion over the next decate, but 98% of the cost occurs after 2014.
 7. Medical device manufacturers pay $2Billion/year in taxes. This will rise to $3Billion/year in 2018, removing $1Billion that could be used for R&D and adding it to the cost of current devices instead.
 8. The rest of the country will pay ALL of Nebraska's state contributions to Medicare FOREVER because that was the bribe that the Democrats made for the 60th vote.

"21882","It is the ""per capita"" that is important. We are not going to be saving any money on a cash flow basis. In theory we are going to be treating more people for the same money. Essentially the goal is a gain in efficiency.
 
 The problem I am seeing is that so far I have not seen anything in the bill that really touches on waste in our health care system. I have used this example before. A while back I injured my ankle. I went to the doctor to get it checked even though I was fairly certain it was just sprained. He agreed that it was probably just sprained, but sent me down for an MRI just to be sure. 
 
 Why a $3000 MRI instead of a $70 X-ray? I don't know, and when I asked him, he did not really seem to know. The MRI gives better detail, but in checking for broken bones that is not really a consideration. He said that was just the protocol they use now. 
 
 If we want o0ur health care system to work for everybody at a reasonable price, inefficiencies like that need to stop. The price of prescription drugs needs to be brought down and the American people need to be educated enough to understand that the ""need money for research"" excuse that the drug companies use to explain away their 2000% markups is BS....over 80% of medical research for new prescription drugs in this country is ALREADY funded by taxpayer dollars through NIH grants. Using the cost of that research...which we already paid for...to justify a 2000% markup is insane. 
 
 We need to remove medical exemptions from anti-racketeering and price fixing laws. We need to overhaul our horribly outdated patent system when it comes to drug formulations and medical devices. 
 
 The new bill does not do any of that....at least not the parts I have seen. The new bill basically focuses on getting more people insured and putting more money in the insurance companies pockets. While we may see a slight efficiency gain from increased preventative care, I dont think the savings will be enough to come anywhere close to ""fixing"" the system.","So in short the best case scenario is we go from $6,000 per capita to.......$6,000 per capita. Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well, some of them. 
 
 This seems optimistic to me.",2
