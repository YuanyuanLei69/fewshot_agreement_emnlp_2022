"7461","Dr Gillian Leng, Nice deputy chief executive, said 'The committee concluded that Lapatinib is not a cost-effective use of NHS resources when compared with current treatment.'","So, what is the current treatment and how effective is it? Obviously it is more COST effective.

"4971","Your figures aren't substantiated by any cites, but nevertheless, one can infer on the basis of what people have said they do want, i.e. a public option and/or single payer, that the dissatisfaction with the bill is mostly for reasons quite unlike your own.","No need to infer diddly.

 If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.com
 
 So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?",0

 I just love how Liberals like to twist this to mean that it's the government's responsibility to care for us via food (food stamps), income (welfare checks), Medicaid/Medicare/S-Chip, etc.","I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?",0
"3365","Anyway, health care is not a civil right","SO an inalienable right put forth by our founding fathers is thus not true? Is the concept of life within only the context of birth? Maintaining health is a matter of civil rights of the most dire and personal to us all.

"3907","Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. 
 
 So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?","You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase.",0
"7067","The public option before the Congress is not subsidized.","Yes it is. It will be funded by government money, the taxpayer will foot the bill.
 
 The argument that it will not be ""subsidised"" is based on the ridiculous hypothesis that somehow, someway, it will turn a profit and pay back the enormous injection of public funds needed to start it up (of course, providing an interest-fee-unlimited-repayment-term-loan is in itself, also a subsidy).
 
 If it behaves in such a way as to maximise profit, like its private sector alternatives, what possible purpose does it serve? It's either 
 
 a) Pointless. Why don't we also have a ""public option"" pizza restaurant chain and a ""public option"" door to door sales force?

 b) Very bad.

 This is nothing but a government giveaway of dynamic proportions. It's not only going to low-income uninsured - it's going to people who are currently employed and actually HAVE insurance.

"5787","I can't think of any good reason to qualify the delivery of healthcare other than need for a physician.
 
 Where one lives or doesn't live, makes no difference, and neither does the fact that a person has broken the law.
 
 Health care is a civil and human right in a democratic society.","Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one.",0

 All the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes i.e. longer life expectancy, fewer preventable deaths, lower infant mortality, in most cases more doctors per capita. They have lower cost in spite of the fact that the U.S. insurance companies insure only the healthy. Over there they treat the sick. What are the insuranc ecompanies doing with our money?? How come the small businesses, the self-emplyed are priced out of the market and left to die in pain??",0
"5217","It's easy to understand why the insurance and drug companies would want to avoid Health Care Reform at most any cost.","Actually insurance and drug companies love fascist ""reforms"", because they eliminate the need for competition. Insurance and drug companies utterly support forcing people to buy insurance. 
 
 Spare us the tired michael moore government vs corporations rhetoric, it's obvious they're both on the same side. And if you didn't realise that after the bank bailouts, the only healthcare you're in need of is a lobotomy.",0
"4280","They are utterly nonproductive, they waste health care dollars, they do not begin to adequately provide health care.
 
 Truth be told, health insurance companies do more to prevent health care than they cause heath care to occur.
 
 Profit and greed and enormous CEO salaries and excessive CEO bonuses are the only reasons for being of health insurance companies.
 
 Those who are insured by health insurance companies are almost always totally screwed. They pay and pay premiums and get very little in return.","You think its bad now? Watch what happens if Gov't takes control. I saw a great tagline the other day, it said ""If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare?""
 Anyone who doesn't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them, at least until the gov't takes over.

Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine.",0

 The lawyers are the only ones that will benefit from this passing. There will be multiple injunctions imposed on this legislation by the middle of April. This legislation will never be enforced, it can't pass a judicial sniff test.
 By the end of 2012 A large portion of the legislators that voted for this will be voted out of office, including the President that signed it. It will then be repealed and the lawyer will have to find another cash cow.",0
"8396","Sure, just as Nicolas Sarcozy, Gordon Brown, Fredrik Reinfeldt, Kevin Rudd, [et al], along with Barack Obama are too. The United States stands alone, at present, among westernized nations, in not guaranteeing health care, and therefore, the only truly democratic nation left on the planet!
 
 At the next teabagging party, they should carry signs of the leaders of all the westernized nations, including the U.S. President, with tiny moustaches.

 Treat it for the corrupt and murderous racket it truly is.","Wow! You really have been paying attention to the Democratic smear campaign of the healthcare insurance industry, haven&#8217;t you? Did you also pay attention to their relative profit margins VS those of other industries? It was 2.2% ROI!!! Banks make 10X that much and I don&#8217;t hear your demagoguery directed at them. In fact over 35 other industries make higher profits than health insurance companies. 
 Try doing some of your own research for a change and stop listening to DNC brainwashing.

 I am sorry that someone near to you was attacked. I do not believe that the attack occurred simply because the attacker was illegal.
 
 As a matter of fact, all such attacks are illegal, unlawful, whether perpetrated by an ""illegal"" or anyone else. I hope that the attacker was brought to justice and punished.","Did Jesus mention the workshy and lazy?
