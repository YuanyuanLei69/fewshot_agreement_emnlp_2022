"5577","Well then this doesn't answer my question.
 
 If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.com

I think your problem is that you are convinced in your head that that in our healthcare there is no waste. And you are trying to square it with the obvious fact that our cost is the highest with nothing to show for it. You will have to admit that there is waste.
 
 For example we have 5x as many MRI scanners than we need, we perform too many tests, we have high adminstrative cost. All these costs will be reduced. There will be fewer of these things PER INSURED. I do not know how many times I have to repeat this before you get it. The volume of this work PER INSURED will decrease. Do you understand that?",1

 By Alec MacGillis
 Washington Post Staff Writer 
 Monday, October 26, 2009 
 People are more likely to buckle their seat belt than follow the speed limit, even though the penalties for speeding are higher. They are more likely to go along with hotel efforts to reduce linen laundry if told that other guests are doing the same. 
 And the question of whether people will follow a government order that they carry health insurance -- an issue that will help determine whether universal health care is a success or costly failure -- will depend on more than the penalty they would pay for refusing, many economists say. This, they say, is the lesson of behavioral economics, a school of thought that holds that people do not necessarily make decisions out of well-reasoned self-interest. It is an approach that has gained a powerful foothold in the Obama White House. 
 ""We're human. And there are lots of other influences that go into what we do,"" said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. ""One of the most important insights of behavioral economics is that we're not all rational maximizers calculating our cost and benefits and doing things like a computer."" 
 As the proposed $900 billion health-care legislation inches toward the finish line, a critical unknown is whether people would comply with a mandate on individuals to carry insurance, one of the Democrats' primary tools to significantly increase the number of Americans who have coverage. The Senate Finance Committee, whose bill has dominated much of the recent debate, set its maximum penalty for noncompliance at $750 per year, at the same time creating subsidies to help low-income Americans buy coverage. In the House, the penalty is based on income, but works out to about the same for a middle-class family. 
 ......
 As the behavioral economists see it, compliance will depend not only on the penalties and cost of coverage, but also on the ease of signing up for coverage and whether people can be persuaded that it is a widely accepted social norm. They point to the large number of eligible people who fail to take advantage of Medicaid, food stamps and Pell grants as a sign that perceived inconvenience can keep people from taking steps in their economic interest. By contrast, the Medicare drug benefit program has achieved high enrollment partly because low-income Medicare recipients did not need to apply for subsidies if they already qualified for Medicaid. 
 ""Non-financial things matter. . . . When the choice itself is complicated, it can deter people from making choices,"" said William J. Congdon of the Brookings Institution. ""The small hassles associated with taking up programs -- driving to an office, filling out a form -- have a disproportionate effect in discouraging people."" 
 The record of mandates is mixed, according to research done by Sherry Glied, a Columbia University professor of health policy who has been nominated for a position in the administration. The rates of people buying car insurance, for example, vary among states and do not correlate directly with the size of penalties for going without insurance. Overall, she found, mandates work best when compliance is relatively easy and affordable, when penalties are ""stiff but not excessive,"" and when enforcement is prompt and routine. 
 The thinking is that people tend to settle for the default option -- in the most oft-cited example, people are far more likely to participate in a 401(k) savings plan at work if they are automatically enrolled in it, with the choice of opting out. OMB Director Peter Orszag has done research on that point, and Cass R. Sunstein, the director of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, featured it in ""Nudge,"" the 2008 popularization of behavioral theory that he co-authored. 
 Some experts argue against setting up an equivalent default enrollment for health insurance, since it would require spending money and choosing an insurer. But others, including one of the behavioral economists hired by Orszag, Harvard University's Sendhil Mullainathan, have argued for using the tax system to collect automatic payments for health premiums. washingtonpost.com","So much for choice. Obama's little socialist minions want to use the tax system to collect healthcare premiums if you don't comply.

"6138","Put a fork in it. Socialized medicine is DOA.
 
 The possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the Democrats to become Washington outsiders in quick order. They are:
 1. Get the HR to pass the Senate Bill without any changes. This will be suicidal to the most liberal Democrats and the most Conservative ones, because the Senate Bill is a neutered version of the House Bill.
 2. They drag their feet on certifying Brown until after the reconsiliation process occurs so that they maintain their supermajority. This option is ever worse than Option 1 because it exposes every Democrat in Congress for the unprincipled b@#$%rds that they are and will cause a firestorm against them for years to come. If there's one lesson that crooked politicians should have learned by now, it's the lesson of Watergate.

"9783","And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible.","Well, at least you have that right.
 
 The cheapest and most efficient way of delivering health care is through single payer financed by taxes.
 
 Every single study ever done demonstrates that the most efficiently run health care system is Medicare. It functions with a 2% overhead.
 
 As I hope you know, insurance is based on the principal of risk-spreading, and the larger the pool the more the risk is spread.
 
 Even now, if you are healthy and privately ""insured"" you are paying for others' health care. You pay premiums and the benefits go to those who are in need of benefits.
 
 The only difference is that you support all the clones and drones in the health care ""industry"" who come between the physician and the delivery of services.

 Medical Bankruptcy: Myth Versus Fact 
 David Dranove and Michael L. Millenson 
 Abstract 
 
 David Himmelstein and colleagues recently contended that medical problems contribute to 54.5 percent of personal bankruptcies and threaten the solvency of solidly middle-class Americans. They propose comprehensive national health insurance as a solution. A reexamination of their data suggests that medical bills are a contributing factor in just 17 percent of personal bankruptcies and that those affected tend to have incomes closer to poverty level than to middle class. Moreover, for national health insurance to have an impact, it would have to define ""medical"" expenses in a much broader way than is now typical of either private or government-funded plans.
