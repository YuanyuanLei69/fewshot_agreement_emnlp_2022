 Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","The wikipedia reference has recorded data from:
 
 ""The Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) is an atmospheric baseline station on Mauna Loa volcano, on the big island of Hawaii. Since 1957 MLO has been continuously monitoring and collecting data relating to atmospheric change, and is known especially for their continuous monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, which is sometimes referred to as the Keeling Curve. The observatory is under the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).""
 
 Could it possibly be that we should be considering an increased activity of the volcano? Are we interpreting what we observe erroneously?",0.5,1

 Not really. World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging, not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates. Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper.

 Cereal factories aren't that big of polluters. The largest polluters are energy plants with a few exceptions like some of Alcoa's smelters which burns one of the dirtiest types of coal in the almunimum production process.

 No they aren't. The sun is the main source of weather through the energy transfer from light to various parts of the enviroment. 
 
 
 
 We don't actually know this for sure. There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms. The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer. Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change. And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe.","Thank you for your criticism. :D",0.6,1

"1140","Global warming is nothing more than a myth that was cooked up by nature freaks who're against anything industrialized.
 
 And if that isn't true, then I don't care; we've already done far too much damage for any difference to be made now.","Hi NATO, I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all. Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.
 
 But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.
 
 So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet, since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim.",0.571428571429,1

 Hardcopy Funk and Wagnalls copyrighted 1954 -1956 reads as follows:
 
 ""Other atomospheric gases are argon, 9400 ppm; ... neon 18 p.p.m.; ... xenon. 0.09 p.p.m. The carbon-dioxide content of the air is about 0.03 percent by volume. Although it may be subject to slight local variations, this percentage is maintained nearly constant by carbon dioxide dissolving into or evaporating from the waters of the oceans. The carbon dioxide content of sea water is about a thousand times as great as that of the atmosphere.""

 Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.
 
 As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.
 
 Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.
