"8002","Global warming sure is a threat. Some of the Polar Ice Caps already melted. Average temperatures have rised since 50+ years ago at a constant rate. We better stop polluting now, or we will be in big trouble.","The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.
 Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK.

 http://www.4forums.com/political/debate-tournaments/6588-clive14-vs-jpsartre12-global-warming.html#post172723","Great insight and response to him. I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources, for so long. And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now, which just makes my decade... emoticon_xhoho Here's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08, and an excerpt from that article. Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam. It's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter.
 Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?
 By Noel Sheppard (Bio | Archive)
 April 25, 2007 - 21:54 ET 
 It's conceivable that years from now, America's media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase ""carbon credits"" to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote ""carbon neutral.""
 
 Given the media's love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.
 
 However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):http://www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html",2

As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow the earth's temperature rise, not lead it.","Because in the case of glacial/interglacial variation, CO2 functions as a feedback from orbital forcing.
