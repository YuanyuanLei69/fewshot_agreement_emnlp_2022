"274","The ""solution"" is what's causing all of the ocean currents to produce ""mega"" hurricanes, tsunamis, and other ""freak weather"". If the more ice melts, the weather could only get much worse. That is why we must act fast. I am not trying to scare you, or freak you out by this, but this is a very serious matter.","We don't actually know this for sure. There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms. The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer. Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change. And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe.",1
"2622","Global warming is causing the ice caps, glaciers, and Polar Regions of the world, like Antarctica, the Arctic Circle, and areas around Northern Canada, Northern Russia, and Greenland, to melt. What happens is, the ice is made from fresh water, when the ice melts, the fresh water mixes with the salt water in the oceans, which makes a ""fresh/salt solution"". When the ""solution"" forms, it makes the ocean currents act strange.","Flooding is more a immediate problem.",1
"3329","Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment. Now the increasing amount of natural disasters worries me a lot more than global warming which doesn't seem to be progressing to quickly (from winter to early summer, 136 of 140 days were below average temperature where I live). I could really use some global warming up here in Michigan!!!","Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.
 I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.
 These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.
 Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.",1
"7183","There is definitely a controversy between whether or not Global Warming is happening or not. I know that where I live, the year-round temperature is actually getting colder! Anyway, even if Global Warming was a proven fact, nothing should change. We should still be trying to create as little pollution as possible, right? So, what does it matter?","Because global warming changes what we consider to be pollution. CO2 emissions are only really a pollutant because they contribute to climate change, because the levels for CO2 to be toxic to humans are order of magnitude higher than those presently in the atmosphere.",1
"3289","Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?","It seems that the high priest of Global Warming is so unconcerned about its reality that In the past year, Gore's home burned through 213,210 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, enough to power 232 average American households for a month.

"9981","There isn't. The controversy is over whether it's man-made or not.","And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate.",1
"4545","The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
 
 In the report, senior U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization official Henning Steinfeld reports that the meat industry is ""one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems""[3] and that ""urgent action is required to remedy the situation.""[4]
 
 Other points the report makes are that the world's livestock industry ""generates 65 per cent of human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2""[5] and ""that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.""[6]","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock's_Long_Shadow",1
"551","Those 2% included CO2 and had a number specifically attached to it. I don't remember what that number was, but if it were 'actually' showing measurable increases, why are we not all kept up to speed on how drastic the increases are? [i.e. 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124%].","Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.

"7372","1. The planet is hotter than it's ever been before because we continue to pump CO2 into the air. 
 
 Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago.","Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?",1
"9749","Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago. 
 
 I do not know whether the above statement is true or false, but for arguements sake, lets say it is true.
 
 OK, the planet is not as hot as 4000 years ago. Is that a good thing? 
 Maybe, but the planet is heating up. And it will not just reach the heat of 4000 years ago and stop. 4000 years ago there wasn't as much toxic gases being released and other forms of pollution. I'm afraid the planet will continue heating and heating.
 Are we going to sit back and watch our planet's temp rise and rise? Does it have to reach a temp higher than that of 4000 years ago before we acknowledge the problem?","There are those people out there who are very educated and believe that it is rediculous that greenhouse gases are causing the increase in tempurature right now. It can be shown that the world was cooler 4000 years ago and that in itself indicates that there is some sort of cycle the Earth's tempurature goes through over time. So there is evidence that the increase in temp is based on a natural cycle and not greenhouse gases. I don't particularly know if it is true or not but it is something to consider.",1

 EDITORIAL: Hiding evidence of global cooling - Washington Times","Here is what your link says. It is shocking that we have discovered this SCAM has been going on for decades leading up to the current Cap and Trade Legislation and Treaties which will indebt average americans to paying for a scam to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Again, from your link:
 Scientific progress depends on accurate and complete data. It also relies on replication. The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change.
 
 It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in England. Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world. Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims.
 
 Professor Phil Jones, the head of the Climate Research Unit, and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University, who has been an important scientist in the climate debate, have come under particular scrutiny. Among his e-mails, Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the ""trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [in temperature].""
 
 Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that ""scientists often used the word 'trick' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret.' "" Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation, we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so-called global-warming ""to hide the decline."" Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann's past research, it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily.
 Here's more on this travesty: The Global Warming Scam Notice that the IPCC which has been the source for global warming lies which its defenders have been posting here for years has been deep into the scam of misinforming the public. It should also be noted that European stock advisers have called for the selling off of alternative energy stocks in light of these scam revelations.",1

"5901","Secondly, even if the western world were to actually reduce the amount of grains AND meat it consumed, this would leave them with a whole bunch of money left over, which would then be diverted into other consumables, which may be more carbon intensive than the food production process. I'd bet that many american families finding themselves with an extra $10 a week in their pockets would spend it on petrol, air con, plasma tvs, cars, apartments. So the impact on carbon emissions may well be positive instead of negative.","Perhaps, but as studies have noted, contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment.
 
 ""The livestock sector is a major player [in climate change], responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport.""
 
 I've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2.
 
 Furthermore, IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices. Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front.",1
