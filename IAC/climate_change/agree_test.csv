"2753","Termites produce two times the carbon dioxide that humans do... let's have a war with termites to get rid of some carbon dioxide. :) lol","ICBM, but I believe the termites make up the largest land-based biomass on earth.",1.14285714286,2
"7856","You'll have to ask gnojek that. It appears he thinks that any pronouncement by a scientist suggesting CO2 production is a problem is a conspiracy theory by scientists to get bigger budgets:
 
 ""As scientists we will tell you that there is a major problem that can only be solved through science , which can only be done with money. We're scientists and we really like grant money to do research. Wouldn't it be great if we had a global initiative to fund this research indefinitely, or until the global warming problem is solved...""
 
 It's the YEC movement all over again: there's no proof, the evidence could be interpreted either way, it's a scientific conspiracy theory, the Devil is behind it: it's un-Christian to cut back on fossil fuel burning etc emoticon_xclown","Ah, my bad... :p",1.6,2
"894","Oh, BTW, I've traded posts with Waxy for quite a while starting in another forum two years ago, he's anything BUT yellow bellied. emoticon_rolleyes","I know. Thus the ""wink"" smilie.",1.6,2
"8787","Don't expect the recent retractions and exonerations to change that. One of the strongest, most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told X, especially if X is shocking, if they are later told, ""No, we were wrong about X,"" most people still believe X. As Twain and Churchill knew, sometimes the truth never catches up with the lie, let alone overtakes it. As I wrote last summer in a story about why people believe lies even when they're later told the truth, sometimes people's mental processes simply go off the rails.","Absolutely true!
 I discovered that with my fluoride research...
 
 For whatever reason, most people take another's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves.
 If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill, they'll take the lie. emoticon_frazzled",3,2
"680","I also visited the university's website and looked at their data. There does appear to be information which contradicts with the above listed article's claims (e.g. - http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/nhshgl.gif). Not sure what he is talking about.","It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever ""conclusion"" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me.",2.5,2
