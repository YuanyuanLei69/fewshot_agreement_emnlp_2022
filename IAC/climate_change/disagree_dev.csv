 Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus

 Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring.
 
 
 Alarmists Claim Debate Over
 
 On June 1, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed ""the debate is over"" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.
 
 The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, ""The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.""
 
 On June 13, USA Today declared, ""The debate's over: Globe is Warming."" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.
 
 
 Scientists Disagree
 
 While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.
 
 Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. ""Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,"" wrote Singer.
 
 Singer wrote, ""Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.""
 
 Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, ""Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.
 
 ""Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.""
 
 
 Sun Called Primary Cause
 
 ""If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,"" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. ""The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences.""
 
 The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. ""Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate,"" Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.
 
 Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, ""empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers.""
 
 Added Peiser, ""In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea.""Heartland Institute - Article

 Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming &#8211; Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics
 October 17, 2006
 
 October 17, 2006
 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific &#8220;consensus&#8221; on climate alarmism.
 
 Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France&#8217;s Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled &#8220;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&#8221; (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribunes/dossier/allegre/dossier.asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the &#8220;cause of climate change remains unknown&#8221; and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.
 
 &#8220;Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,&#8221; Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that &#8220;the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!&#8221;
 
 Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. ""By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,"" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled &#8220;World Scientists' Warning to Humanity&#8221; in which the scientists warned that global warming&#8217;s &#8220;potential risks are very great.&#8221; See: Warning to Humanity
 
 Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.
 
 Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a &#8220;consensus&#8221; about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to &#8220;Holocaust deniers.&#8221; See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as ""global warming deniers.""
 
 This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists&#8217; computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.
 
 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears
 
 Earlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called &#8220;consensus&#8221; that the Earth faces a &#8220;climate emergency.&#8221; On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.
 
 &#8220;Observational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future&#8230;Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary,&#8221; the 60 scientists wrote. See: Open Kyoto to debate
 
 &#8220;It was only 30 years ago that many of today's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe. But the science continued to evolve, and still does, even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas,&#8221; the 60 scientists concluded..: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Press Room :.

It could also affect the balance of the climate system itself and even possibly alter the behaviour of the Gulf Stream.
Part of the process is likely to mean more precipitation (hail, rain, sleet and snow) at higher latitudes, and so more water flowing down the rivers.
......
If the global water distribution changes, this could have important social and economic consequences. An altered hydrological cycle might conceivably have a profound cooling effect on north-west Europe as well.
The American Geophysical Union, publisher of the journal, says: ""It could also alter the balance of the climate system itself, such as the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, a kind of conveyor belt.
...
""It is possible the increase in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could contribute to an alteration in the thermohaline circulation, because it is diluting the saltiness of the seawater and reducing its density.""","Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out, huh?
