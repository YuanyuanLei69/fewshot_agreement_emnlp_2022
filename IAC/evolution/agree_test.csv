 Why would other bats need to be able to receive and interpret this new sonar-producing capability?

"3511","Would someone care to post the ""Cliff Notes"" of ID theory?
 
 The entire theory seems like a non-sequitor to me, at least as presented by our friendly neighborhood ID peddler.
 
 In essence, it seems as though the central claim is that nothing ""intelligent"" and no ""information"" can be be created except by a creator, and that the world as we know it could not exist without this information. Further to that, the complexity and ""order"" of the universe is evidence of the work of an intelligent designer.
 
 Is that fair enough?
 
 So if nothing intelligent and no information can be created, how did the creator get created? That's step one, IMHO, and it would seem to me it all falls apart right there, but I'm assuming I'll get some kind of an ""always there"" or other such supernatural explanation. A luxury never afforded to the ""scientist"" side of the debate.
 
 As far as ""information"" (I really don't like that word anymore :p ) and complexity are concerned, it comes down to the available scientific explanations vs. ""you're wrong, the creator did it"" in various forms. In other words, it essentially boils down to an entirely philosophical debate as from what I've seen so far, it can't really be argued on a purely scientific level.
 
 Further to that, it would seem to me to be a very tenous position to hold to agree that micro evolution and perhaps speciation can occur, and that the world functions as it does because of ""intelligent design"", and yet profess belief in a 6000 year old earth.
 
 In other words, I can't see ID theory, which seems to me to be essentially a form of theistic evolution, being compatible with Young Earth Creationism, or for that matter, with any form of literal Creationism.
 
 I look forward to be edumacated on the subject.

"5911","If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist, then they have set the terms of the debate. In essence these terms are:
 
 1. 'Facts' are neutral. However, there are no such things as 'brute facts'; all facts are interpreted. Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument, then the Christians' presuppositions are gone, leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts. Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions - see Naturalism, logic and reality.","This is where intuitive, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else, right?
 
 Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position: by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race.
 
 Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically. But it would be in vain, because there are, after all, no such thing as 'brute facts'. The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic. To someone whose presupposition is otherwise, your 'facts' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased, or at least faulty in some unknown way.
 
 In short, following Ken Ham's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight. We can venture to justify no opinion or belief, because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another. I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself, and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument, for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are, in Ken's eyes, inviolate.
 
 This is hardly the result Ken could have intended. What's gone wrong? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly?
 
 The answer, of course, is that the playing field isn't really level.
 
 Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly, and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place. The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed. This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates, and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma:
 
 Good axioms yield accurate predictions.
 
 As Ken rightly observed, known facts are always subject to interpretation. But the reverse process, the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory, is not. In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find. This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality.
 
 This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal. The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant, but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom.
 
 So, part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that, in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark. The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible, as should identically located retroviral insertions. We should not have found fossils at all, let alone a nested hierarchy of forms. We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation. We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies.
 
 All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact. Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we don't know about; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past. But these rationalisations entail further predictions: we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can. If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we don't. If fossils were laid down by the flood we wouldn't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth, or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains, and we wouldn't expect there to be anything like as much limestone. If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years, we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air. And so on.
 
 Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions, predicting something we didn't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed. And that's the bottom line: Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge, but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions, indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality, Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur.",1,2
"8695","Creationists and evolutionists, Christians and non-Christians all have the same evidence-the same facts. Think about it: we all have the same earth, the same fossil layers, the same animals and plants, the same stars-the facts are all the same.
 
 The difference is in the way we all interpret the facts. And why do we interpret facts differently? Because we start with different presuppositions. These are things that are assumed to be true, without being able to prove them. These then become the basis for other conclusions. All reasoning is based on presuppositions (also called axioms). This becomes especially relevant when dealing with past events.","This opening paragraph sets the stage for the rest of the article, and on the face of it there wouldn't seem to be much to disagree with.

 1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous?
 
 2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world?
 
 3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world?
 
 4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record?

He likely would have stated that any two animals receiving differential rewards would have likely learned that if they wait then they also will receive a more liked item. Not a sense of justice but learning by observation.
 
 Tolman further would argue that conditioned taste responses for the monkey receiving the preferred reward would be of greater value. In other words, if they were rewarded sometime when they didn't do anything would their work rate go down compared to the other monkey?
 
 Would the other monkey continue at the same rate although it may not accept the less preferred food?
