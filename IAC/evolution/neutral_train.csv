 How can you say such things? The Bible says that God CREATED over and OVER and OVER again!","And the wonders all around us show us how. . .",1
"5592","That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs. It is not the job of science to fix or accommodate the inaccuracies of religion. Within science classrooms, science is and should remain pre-eminent, so that people can make informed decisions.","But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.",1
"7196","It seemed logical to me once, the idea of macro-evolution. Let us suppose we have a species called ""X"". If over a period of time the population became split by distance, we could call them ""X-1"" and ""X-2"". Again, over a period of time, changes may have happened in one group, through mutations, so that ""X-1"" may have changed so much that if the two populations were ever re-united, they'd be unable to inter-breed... thus they'd be two distinct species. Evolutionaries call this Sympatric Speciation.","Actually, mutations accumulate in both populations.",1

"3314","Im guessing its a science, because its widely accepted by scientist. Creationism is a religion, because it envolves God. Right?","Evolution is a science. ""Evolutionism"" is a word coined by creationists to make evolution sound more like a matter of faith than science.
 
 Likewise, creationsim isn't a religion, it's a belief based on religion. Sorry to be nit-picky, but precision in language helps in these sorts of discussions.
 
 Bascially you are right. Creationism is based on relgious beliefs and so teaching it in public schools in almost any scenario violates the constitution. Creationists keep repackaging it to try to make it seem non-religious, coming up with intelligent design, for example. However, courts keep ruling that it is illegal. I think the only thing you're missing is an understanding of how divorced from reality some creationists can be. They won't let a little thing like the law stop them from pushing their agenda.",1

"9","First off, the scientific method goes:
 
 1) Form Hypothesis
 
 2)Test hypothesis
 
 3)Form conclusion (or theory)
 
 *correct me if I wrote the scientific method wrong*","You guys know me. Always happy to correct anyone.
 
 As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on.
 
 In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality.",1
"7450","Well, it is all really silly. You're fighting over an issue that will never be resolved. Believ what you want, because you can never be proven wrong.

"2312","Let's see some bullet items to debate, not the sea-of-montalban's-ideas","And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the ""TROOTH"" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant.",1
"2273","If it came from nothing, how do you explain that?","Well, scientists in the appropriate fields of science are working on that. I'm not a cosmologist so I rely on scientists in those fields to research those questions. I'm a biologist. I deal with questions of biology, that is living organisms. That is why I am concerned with how living organisms change through time. In other words, that is why I am concerned with evolution. While physicists, cosmologists, geologists and so on may accept evolutionary theory, that doesn't mean that their fields of science are ""evolution.""",1
"829","Then, there are various fossilization mechanisms. I couldn't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms, so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that. 
 
 Now, how long did the fossilization take? Did it take 10 or 10,000 or 10,000,000 years?
 
 Are the fossils we see all the result of one big 'tragic' event for all, or little 'tragic' events for each?
 
 Any thoughts?","Well, Google is your friend here emoticon_idea - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.
 
 It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as ""one big preservation event"" and lots of ""little preservations"". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.

The chicken comes in from a reacting factor that showed a reaction in the presence of the subfossil 'collagen' material. He hasn't changed it on this occasion, he's just not able to read context....
Oh, by the way AA, are you planning on replying? Or do you cede that fossil discussion?",1
"6770","1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous?
 
 2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world?
 
 3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world?
 
 4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record?
 
 5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?","May I attempt to respond as an IDist would respond?
 
 1) If God-- err, the designer can pop IC systems into existence at will, don't you think He.../she/it can do so any way he/she/it damn well pleases? See also answer 2.
 
 2) IDists need no mechanistic explanation. The idea that evidence for design means design stands by itself. (Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/""unevolvable"" systems; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement.)
 
 3) Again, the validity of ID depends not on the designer's choices but only on the designer interacting at all.
 
 4) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have; after all, some IDists ""don't doubt"" mechanisms such as natural selection. For the obvious problem of the designer ""letting"" species go extinct, see answer 3.
 I'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood.
 And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people.
 
 5) Not a single one. (Either that answer, or maybe ""Well, uh, hasn't Behe done something by now?"", which still means none.)
 
 
 So there you have it. An evolutionist's formulation of an IDists response. Appropriately, because ID as a whole is essentially an argument from ignorance, ignorance plays a role the answers to all your questions. (""Don't know""/""Don't care""/""Doesn't matter."") ID simply sidesteps these issues.
 Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable, except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution. Some will claim that they ""have no reason"" to doubt common descent (a la Behe) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it.
 
 And if any IDists have a problem with my responses, they're able to post their own responses. However, they were able to do that even before I responded, and they didn't...",1
"1201","5) I have answered most of this statement above, but you must also take into account the incredible cooling that must have occurred when boiling-hot water came into contact with billions of cubic miles of next-to-freezing rainy air. You get the picture.","Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater.
 
 So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere, the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur.",1
"1211","A) I'm not a member there.","That can be easily remedied.",1
"5627","Really, it's a two sided coin. If a theory such as evolution can be taught in school, against many people's beliefs, why can't creationism, without using the excuse that it's ""illegal"".","Because the theory of evolution is the result of science and therefore should be taught in science class.
 
 ID is NOT science and therefore should NOT be taught in science class.
 
 It's that simple.",1
"3040","All other explanations include some form of intelligent, purposeful organization. If that organizing intelligence is internal, that would make it no less no less intelligent.","But then, there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence.",1
"4119","... and woe betide you if you dare to express any doubts.","Really? The poster seems to be insinuating that people who express doubts suffer some kind of sanction. Could he/she please elaborate?",1
"5774","Just because the bible is over 2000 years old doesn't make it unreliable, I mean your placing all your money on a billion year old one cell organism. You don't have any absolute proof and neither do I.","But at least Evolutionist can give physical proofs for their beliefs. It is right that nothing is completely sure and clear, but Evolutionists and Scientists have shown a lot more evidence that shows that Evolution is right, Creationists just can't show enough... (my opinion)
 
 And it's right that most stuff Evolutionists are dealing with are millions of years old, but it still all makes more sense than some stuff in the bible...
 
 There is no complete proof for any of the theories, but Evolution just gives more evidence...
 And if Creationists just want some credit for their beliefs and work, they shouldn't want evolution to be deleted vom Education. No one knows what is right but right now the theories of Evolution just shows more evidence and is widely accepted and used...",1
"9317","I am primarily interested in seeing how the creationists wriggle around this one.","Well, let's see.
 
 1 This is a skull from a modern human, the differences representing pathological deformities.
 2 The dating is based on disputed methodology. Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable.
 3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual.
 4 Where's the conclusive DNA evidence? (A nod to easyrider on the Religion board.)
 5 These claims are made by scientists, and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion (thank you marc9000).
 6 So where's the missing link between the new fossil and us? Huh? Huh?
 
 Sadly, past experience suggests that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely.",1
"825","No, it wasn't. Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion. It seems that according to AIG, 182 actually do.","Hundreds of thousands of atheist scientists do too, since common ancestry with apes harmonizes perfectly with the absence of a creator. They're seldom asked to answer about that confusion, however.",1
"1570","It's interesting how Peddler avoided discussing OR's point that shows Peddler's real goal. 
 
 Ingoring something won't make it go away.","Thanks Duo.
 
 peddler, how about you actually address the points I put to you originally?
 
 ""Off course, you might be trying to infer that because there are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant. I disagree, but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within, lets see......... how about Christianity? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable?""
 
 Cheers :)",1
"9560","I'd like to know how a fission reaction was supposedly possible in the first place. This would be hard to achieve using only light water and (today's) natural uranium (at about 0.7% U-235).","Well, since the composition of the uranium body when it was a natural reactor wasn't the same as today's natural uranium, it doesn't matter. What is important was the composition of the ore back then. Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years, it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly. It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past. It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active. About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3% or more of the composition of the uranium.",1
"3676","Read the preceding verse. ""18 The LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone.

He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found."" (Genesis 2:18-20)","Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,""Hey, Adam needs a helper."" He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals.",1

 Testing Our Defenses
 Stephen J. Simpson and John Travis

 Challenge the immune system, and you might well induce a vigorous response. Challenge an immunologist, and you can be confident of eliciting something rather similar. Indeed, our rate of progress in understanding the immune system has been anything but sluggish over the past few decades. This has encouraged a mood of optimism that new vaccines for infectious diseases and immune-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases are just around the corner. Yet despite this brisk pace of discovery and some enticing glimpses of how the immune system might be manipulated, there is much that is clearly left to explore about its inner workings. In this special issue, we consider a selection of fundamental immunological questions that still test investigators.
 
 As Casanova and Abel explain (p. 617), the genetic study of human primary immunodeficiencies is an emerging field that is revealing surprises about our evolving relationship with the world of pathogens. Kioussis and Georgopoulos (p. 620) discuss the epigenetic rules that govern lymphocyte function and development, and, Reiner et al. (p. 622) frame some of the most pertinent issues in T cell fate determination. Cell biology and immunology have long been intimate partners, and Mellman (p. 625) uses the study of antigen presentation to explain how discoveries in basic cell biology continue to underpin our understanding of the immune system. Finally, Sakaguchi and Powrie (p. 627) reveal just how much there is still to learn about the regulatory T cell and its power in preventing overzealous immune responses and autoimmunity. In News, Leslie (p. 614) describes how immunologists have struggled to understand the purpose of mast cells, and Cohen (p. 612) updates the daring efforts of gene therapists to reboot the human immune system with cells impervious to HIV. Science's STKE focuses on some molecular challenges for immunologists (www.sciencemag.org/sciext/immunology07). Lind&#233;n describes how the adaptor protein Act1 mediates interleukin-17 receptor signaling. Serfling et al. discuss the importance of NFAT transcription factors to memory lymphocytes. Finally, Wattenberg and Raben describe the negative regulation of various immune responses by diacylglycerol kinase.
 
 We are still learning about how immune cells move around the body, and in the research section a Report by Auffrey et al. (p. 666) describes a subset of monocytes that patrol the surfaces of blood vessels for damage and inflammation, contrasting their behavior with that of typical leukocytes. Mueller et al. (p. 670) offer up some intriguing evidence that lymphoid organs ""close up shop"" for new business during an immune response, by using chemokine regulation to prevent the admission of circulating na&#239;ve lymphocytes. In research that may shed some evolutionary light on an ancient system, Chen et al. (p. 678 and see related News item) describe how the social amoeba Dictyostelium uses specialized cells akin to phagocytes in animals. Finally, Carmody et al. (p. 675) reveal the means by which normally potent signals mediated by the innate immune Toll-like receptors are placated by blocking ubiquity-nation. With so much left to discover about our immune system, there seems little doubt that immunologists will find plenty to challenge them in the years to come.","And its all evolved via NDS - marvellous!",1
"1668","""infer (an unknown) from something that is known; conjecture.""","and a conjecture is;",1
"1482","Earth's turn is also slowing down and the calculations backwards on that also create a few problems.","Karl asked him to calculate the length of a day 1 billion years ago. It seems that he needs some help.
 
 A geologist came up with the following numbers from a survey of geology and astronomy texts. Most of these numbers are derived from daily growth rings in coral (bet Freeofthought didn't know there was such a thing) and similar information from brachiopods, bryozoans and pelecypods, and the like.",1

"9716","For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to jmake atonement for yourselves at the alter; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.","Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:
 
 1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.
 
 2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.",1
"9307","""A Law of Nature then is the rule and Law, according to which God resolved that certain Motions should always, that is, in all Cases be performed. Every Law does immediately depend upon the Will of God."" Gravesande, Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy, I, 2-3, 1726, quoted in CC Gillespie, Genesis and Geology, 1959.
 
 Judges 21:15 "" 4 The people were still disconsolate over Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach among the tribes of Israel. ""
 
 4. 4 [15] Had made a breach: what is here attributed to God was in reality the free and deliberate act of the Israelites and happened only by the permissive will of God. The ancients attributed to the first primary cause what is more directly due to secondary causes.""
 http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/judges/judges21.htm
 
 ""Yes, God's eternal decree is being worked out, but the working out of that eternal decree is done through his interaction with people, and through their decisions and actions. The role that man's actions take in the working out of God's will is called a ""secondary cause."" The Westminster Confession of Faith explains it this way:
 ""God is the first cause, and in relationship to Him everything happens unchangeably and infallibly. However, by this same providence, He orders things to happen according to secondary causes. As a result of these secondary causes, some things must inevitably happen; others may or may not happen, depending on the voluntary intentions of the agents involved; and some things do not have to happen but may, depending on other conditions (WCF 5.2; I've quoted from Summertown Text's modern version).""
 http://www.thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/file/99788.qna/category/th/page/questions/site/iiim","So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are, and are not first (primary) causes. And atheists believe everything is a second cause (or first cause) with no intelligence behind it. 
 
 It still doesn't make any sense to me why theistic evolutionists are in such agreement with atheists, and so far apart from ""fundamentalists"".",1
"5392","Any SCIENTIST whether creationist or Darwinian cannot represent the ID/Creationist side.

Wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist! Will wonders never cease!","Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of ""creation science"" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science.

 Common tactic - keep claiming that you will do something, then claim to have already done it later on, without, of course, actually doing it.

If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box.",1
"6139","Personally I find it similar to taking the Saxon Chronicles litterally.
 The latter parts may be reasonably accurate, (insofar as an official history can be) but parts, in particular the start are pure mythology.

"2673","No, faith and reason are mutually exclusive. Science is based on reason.","As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out.

"9230","As many polls have shown, the more educated a person becomes, the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist.","That would depend on how the poll was done, and what education levels were compared.

If a poll was conducted among the LEAST educated (prison populations - unwed welfare mothers - deadbeat dads - intercity homeless, etc) I wouldn't need a poll to tell me that almost none of them would believe in creation. It's interesting that the most educated, and the least educated, could very well have similar worldviews, largely that once life is over it was purposeless and pointless.

You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However, stasis is the norm in a stable environment. The reasons are simple. Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment. As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct. The fossil record is full of such examples. Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment.

 Where did the dirt come from?","Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations 
 
 At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link:
 Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A 
 
 The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.

"4177","Here's how life really operates.....
 
 Take a look at this link: http://people.bu.edu/jtouchon/tadpole.htm
 
 In it you will see an experiment with tadpoles. Some tadpoles were raised in an enviornment with fish; some with dragonfly nymphs; and some alone.
 
 If you were to believe evolutionists, you would have to believe that a tadpole is a tadpole is a tadpole. And specific traits would only arise from the luck of the draw. But look at the above link. What really happens is tadpole generate different traits based on their predators. The tadpoles raised with dragonfly nymphs generated shorter bodies and different colored tails than those raised alone or with fish.
 
 Thus if a population of tadpoles were raised in a pond that was newly inhabited by dragonfly nymphs, it might APPEAR that tadpoles evolved new traits via selection....but what's really happening is phenotypic plasticity.
 
 My assertion is that much of what is considered ""evolution"" in the field is nothing more than a morphological response similar to what the tadpoles show in this link. Finch beaks, moth wing variation, lizard legs, and every other so-called ""proof"" of evolution would be no different.
 
 This is why it's extrememly important that science does controlled experiments. If the experiments are not controlled and populations of animals are merely observed generating new triats in the field after serveral years or generations, there is no scientific justification in saying the traits were formed via selection.
 
 Not only that, but why is it that science is willing to test plasticity, yet is not willing to carry the test out further to see if the offspring of tadpoles emerge with shorter bodies and redder tails? Why won't they test the concept that individuals can evolve?
 
 My final comment/question, aside from the fact that this tadpole example falsifies the linked explanation for evolution, is I would like you evolutionists to tell me how this is accomplished. I mean HOW does the tail of a tadpole change to red simply because a predator is around? How does that happen without the mind or some sort of intelligence being involved? I would like an explanation.
 
 Please also keep in mind that if all observed occurrences of evolution are actually just cases of phenotypic plasticity, then there's no sense in saying Selection actually occurs. If selection doesn't occur then evolution is falsified.","From Justin Charles Touchon, author of ""Predator-Induced Developmental Plasticity of Hyla ebraccata tadpoles"", the study that SS is misrepresenting",1

It's just that hotspots apart, there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes. Within certain constraints, they appear to be random, but evolutionary theory as such doesn't demand that they should be.
 
 Second, natural selection through competition for resources isn't the only force constraining evolution (though it is the major explanation of adaptation).

 Then he starts equating the Bible Code (which has been debunked, I mean seriously debunked, start here).

It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge.

 I suppose one important point is whether feathers were a characteristic feature of all Coelurosauria at the time when the chinese specimens date from or if they were limited to those group that were directly ancestral to the birds.
 
 If they were a diverse trait, then its more likely that feathers featured in T. Rex's ancestry. However, even if this were the case it would instantly mean that T. Rex was feathered itself- there is a great period of time over which such a trait could have been modified or lost entirely. Maybe T-Rex could have been like modern large mammals that do not have insulating hair- it might have retained a few specialised feathers for other specific purposes.

It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars ""evolve"" in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.
 
 Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the ""theory of evolution,"" it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest.

"2524","Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.","On the face of it, the implication is that this kind of thing happens all the time; that everywhere you look, stress-induced hypermutation is occurring, and along with it adaptive mutations are occurring disproportionately often - that this is part and parcel of everyday evolution.
 
 The ardour with which this evidence is brandished is, however, misleading. In only a handful of studies, using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances, have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency. There is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative, and even if the results were being interpreted correctly, the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan-species mechanism of internally directed evolution is, unfortunately, wishful thinking.
 
 But what of these rare anomalous cases? The most famous was reported by J. Cairns and P. L. Foster, in which a dish of starving, non-growing E-coli (a particular strain with a Lac- mutation) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation (to Lac+) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose. Moreover, the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present, if there was another growth-inhibiting factor in play, or if food sources other than lactose were available. On top of that, although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non-selected mutations, it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation, and the bacteria which didn't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all!
 
 Understandably, this looked to them, and other people at the time, like a pretty cut'n'dried example of an environmentally-or-organismically induced adaptive mutation.
 
 However, the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented, and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions. Why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances?
 
 The answer, as it turned out, was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth' taking place in the e-coli colony was in error.
 
 The strain of e-coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky' (inefficient) mutant Lac allele, with only 1% to 2% of the normal ability to process lactose. That 1% to 2% was then deliberately 'smothered' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e-coli could process, effectively halting their growth. Because the later, visible growing colonies of e-coli had a reversion mutation to lac+, the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible.
 
 However, what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium, a small proportion of the e-coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene. This mutation conferred no advantage - until the colony was plated on lactose. Now, the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth, and the e-coli could (slowly) grow and divide.
 
 Within these slow-growing microcolonies, selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac- duplications. And the more lac- duplications a cell has, the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac+, explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation. When this happens, cell growth rate jumps considerably - but now it is the additional lac- genes which are holding the organism back, destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac+ gene. Selection now favours those lac+ revertants who lose the unstable lac- duplications. By the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye, they consist almost entirely of lac+ revertants.
 
 This hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments, and was verified in a number of ways, including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac- bacteria, increasing the number of microcolonies 100-fold, which tallies with the ~1% background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria. Also, bacteria in the late-arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac- genes.
 
 In short, the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory.
 
 It should be noted, by the way, that in addition to the late-arriving 'directed mutation' microcolonies that causes such a stir, the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early-appearing colonies from pre-plating revertant mutants, a la L&D.
 
 EDIT: Reading further around the subject, it seems no stress-induced hypermutable state was involved either. Apparently, 10-20% of the bacteria with lac- duplications also possessed 'dinB' (a mutation-promoting gene apparently, though it's beyond the scope of my research here) on the same plasmid. The mutagen 'came along for the ride' so to speak, as selection favoured the duplication of that section of DNA, and induced hgher rates of mutation in - yep - 10-20% of the adaptive population.
 
 So not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation (clearly, since the other 80-90% of adaptation happened without it), it was actually harmful.

 2ND EDIT: The same experiment yields similar results with lac- situated within the chromosome itself, only with 100-fold fewer colonies, reflecting the lower incidence of chromosomal duplication and reversion events in comparison with plasmids.",1

"6309","The following is summarized mostly from an article by George Cook in the December 1999 issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology. 
 
 Many of the details of the research that ruled out Lamarckianism are no longer taught to Biology undergrads because the old controversies are no longer in the slightest bit controversial, and the field has moved on to much more interesting debates. The students are simply taught that Lamarckianism is an egregiously failed concept.
 
 Back in the 1890's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution (Spencer for, Weismann against). Supporters of Herbert Spencer, notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally, so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments. This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York, and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments.
 
 Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example, Bumpus's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals. Specifically, Bumpus (1898) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation. In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups (the old original and the more diverse offshoot group) to a third location, and showed that each group continued true to type, notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads. This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature, and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal.

 Starting around 1909, Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions. He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics. However, he realized after a long while (1932) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics.
 
 All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause, and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics, and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics.
 
 However, the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter.","So, he's immune to new information that contradicts his beliefs.

"1878","8.) Show me one instance where an accumulation of mutations created a new species.","Strictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well, it can accumulate or lose an arbitrary number of mutations (variants of alleles); though it may change in form it will remain one species. Also, a species can split in two simply through allelic segregation: no strictly new mutations involved, just the segregation of alleles that used to be distributed throughout an interbreeding population into two seperate populations that don't or can't interbreed.
 
 It's a mistake to think of species as strictly delimited in the same sense as biblical 'kinds'; indeed, the whole notion of a 'species' is hard to define consistently. For instance, two species may (at the moment) be entirely interfertile but not choose to breed (phenotypic segregation), or they may be able to interbreed but have offspring that have a greater or lesser chance of fertility (eg horses and donkeys, lions and tigers), or they may be incapable of interbreeding. Trying to play it safe and say 'a species is a group of animals that can interbreed' also causes problems in the case of ring species. 
 
 Imagine looking down on a hill from above, and imagine a clockface superimposed on it. A species starts at 6'oclock and gradually expands its range around the hill over many generations. By the time the two ends of the expansion meet, at 12 o'clock, it's possible that those two extremes of the population have ceased to be interfertile, despite 1 being still able to breed with 2, 2 with 3 and so on around to 12.

 That being said, the people who voted for these school board folks do deserve to be called stupid. Well they would if they had much of a choice. I can't say this for sure, but knowing Kansas politics, I would say that, chances are, there was only one person on the ticket and if there were more, they probably all held the same views on evolution. That's most of Kansas for ya. As a Missourian once said about Kansans: You'd vote for a cupcake if it registered republican.
 There is an exception to this rule though. After the first evolution debacle back in '99, Kansans voted those dimwits out and put in a new board that changed what the previous board had done. It just seems that some people have a very short memory.

 You can point the following facts out to those who tell us we are XXXXXX in kansas who do not know how to run our schools:
 
 ACT Scores: Kansas has the 8th highest national scores; the highest combination of scores and percentage of students tested. (2000 scores)
 
 SAT Scores: Kansas has the 5th highest scores nationally. (1998 scores)
 
 NAEP Reading Scores: National Assessment of Education Progress. Only one state had a higher average score and percentage of students at or above proficient level than Kansas for fourth grade; only two states scored higher at eighth grade.
 
 
 There is a lot of stuff that pandion is saying ""you don't learn in high school"" that my teachers tell me they are teaching. Then again, we also rank first when it comes to introducing college level curriculum to in our high schools. 
 
 Maybe that is another reason that this is an issue brought up in kansas. Besides the fact that it is incredibly easy to get somethign in front of the school borad, the fact that we are covering more adcvanced curriculum might make this an isse.

 - Supersport
 There has been a radical change in biology, particularly at the molecular level in less than a decade as how knowledge of how genes work has increasived massively in the wake of the human genome project and the advent of 'omic' technologies. The person who wrote the article really needs to update this as they are quite a bit behind the times working from a 1998 text book - especially if you're going to be critising approachs to biotech. A huge amount has happened in the ten years since it was written.
 
 She's also using a few odd terms, DNA -< RNA -< Protein is known as the 'Central Dogma' of molecular biology and doesn't really have much to do with what she is talking about, we already know there were some exceptions to this with retroviruses and we've only recently discovered that RNA plays a lot larger role than just being an intermediate. On top of this, her 'fluid' genome is part of the central dogma - its only a very simplistic description of what happens in the cell and doesn't really go into all the modifications that the protein and RNA undergo that aren't encoded within the gene. 
 
 Most of the 4 assumptions have just been made up though,
 
 
 Is clearly wrong, as its never been beleived that one protein = one trait. Prior to the human genome project it was thought that each gene encoded one protein (hence why the estimates for the total number of genes in the human genome were so high) but we've always known that proteins interacted with each other than that many genes will only produce a trait in combination with particular allele of another gene - even Mendel knew that and he didn't even know what the 'inherited particles' were.
 
 
 Again, we've know pretty much since the first protein structures were worked out that the mRNA doesn't directly translate into the protein and that the translated polypeptide is still not the end protein - that they are both cut up and rearranged. 
 
 Assumption 3 is pretty much accurate, though we have seen some unusual cases that suggest that susceptability to mutation is heritable and even sometimes selected for (indirectly at least). There are also wierder cases of some microorganisms 'stealing' genes from other nearby organisms in times of stress. She is misrepresenting how common these things are though and how easy it is to proove this. If we replace 'genes' with 'sections of the genome' then she is dead wrong and this isn't a common assumption - transposable elements are a good example of how we know DNA sometimes does this. Basically they are bits of a retrovirus that got 'stuck' in our genomes rather than producing new viruses - they've lost most of the coding useful to the virus and now just have enough to write themselves out and them back in again. Post human genome project we know that over 40% of our genome is actually made up of these broken viruses and other similar elements.
 
 Assumption 4 is exactly the same as Assumption 3 - and even now we know that 99.9% of the time this is the case, however we're not entirely sure whether she would count the surrounding ecosystem as part of the 'environment'. We know bacteria can share (or scavenge) new genes and viruses can spread, or at least infere with, them as well.","So since you admit there's been a ""radical change"" in biology do you still think neo-darwinism explains evolution?

 Lipoprotein Lipase S447X: A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation.
 
 Brief Reviews
 Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis & Vascular Biology. 26(6):1236-1245, June 2006.
 Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan Albert
 
 Abstract:
 mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.
 
 This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.

 Emergence of Nylon Oligomer Degradation Enzymes in
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through Experimental Evolution

 Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan
 
 Through selective cultivation with 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer, a by-product of nylon-6 manufacture, as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, which initially has no enzyme activity to degrade this xenobiotic compound, was successfully expanded in its metabolic ability. Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in
 the adapted strains.
 http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/5/2020.pdf
 
 We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century.

 If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.
 
 Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup.
 Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)
 
 It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)

 THEORIES OF LIFE...
 PANSPERMIA
 Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.
 
 One idea is that the building blocks of life ""...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy."" http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html
 
 ""Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled ""Directed Panspermia"" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable."" (Behe, M, ""Darwin's Black Box"", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'
 
 ""COMPLEXITY THEORY 
 Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an ""autocatalytic set"" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).""

 A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay
 Richard Dawkins says of this ""Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.""
 http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/
 
 ""Other Theories
 In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?
 A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem. 
 There is a ""proteins first"" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, ""There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene"" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids. 
 Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12). 
 In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, ""Primordial soup or crêpes?"" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5). 
 Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as ""containers first."" 
 Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in ""cold soup"" under the ice (18, 19). 
 Chemists Claudia Huber and Günter Wächtershäuser say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7). 
 Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8). 
 Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, ""...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth"" (20). 
 Another idea is the ""PNA world."" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life.""

"5158","So how do creationists account for this: ERVs in humans match those in apes.
 
 ERV = useless code in DNA, but present in all members of a species
 
 Basically it goes like this. Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA. This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself, it also replicates the viral DNA. As we all accept, creationists as well, sometimes things go wrong during this replication process. Sometimes, the viral DNA is rendered inactive. This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it. But sometimes, this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing. Therefore, the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error (ERV) permanently and then passes it on. Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome, we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years. This is testable, every human on the planet has the same ERV's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history.
 
 For evolution to be false, and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false, you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs. When we looked, we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences. The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution. We have the same error in our DNA that all apes have. Each of these errors has a cause that we can trace to a single event. How can you deny that that single event took place in a common ancestor?","Is there anyone who doesn't think species come from earlier species?",1

 B. Convergence
 As seen in the docking simulation, the solutions all converge on relatively similar local optima. Examples of molecular and structural convergence are abundant in nature. Also, abiogenesis spectacularly converged into a reasonably optimized genetic code (with a few derivatives) and life's memetic algorithms. Convergence in virtual simulations and in nature thus serve to point to similarities between them.
 
 C) The Biased Nature of Evolution.
 D) The Biased Nature of Evolution.
 After running the docking simulations, the software seemed to have been biased towards a few local optima even after random variation processes. The parallels between development has already been highlighted above. Parallels between development and evolution also exist. Compare the developmental program to evolution. 
 
 Evolution also seems to be biased towards a few endpoints:
 Peer-reviewed article:
 An End to Endless Forms: Epistasis, Phenotype Distribution Bias, and Nonuniform Evolution
 It is argued to be as a result of genetic instructions dating earlier in evolutionary time. (Preadaptations).
 
 To conclude, parallels exist between our own designed docking simulations employing memetic algorithms and the evolution of life.
 These include (Figure 1):
 1) Memetic algoritms
 2) Convergence
 3) Biased to a few endpoints
 4) Local optima (optimal biomolecular machines)

 about a billioon years ago life appeared.","Well the oldest fossils are (IIRC) 3.8 billion years old.......",1
"3584","If living things didnÂ’t reproduce, then life would quickly disappear: and since life has existed continuously on Earth for nearly four billions years, then life must be able to reproduce.","While that may be true of life in general, all it really logically entails is that SOME Â– not all Â– organisms throughout all of lifeÂ’s history were able to reproduce. And at a smaller scale, it does not apply to any individual organism: it doesnÂ’t tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce (take for example, mules).
Must All Living Organisms Die?
An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die. After all, if a living organism didnÂ’t die, then it wouldnÂ’t need to reproduce in order to persist, even for 4 billion years. We need to ask, Â“Does this assumption of universal death hold?Â” Yes, well, at least for all instances of life that we currently know of. Thus, it is a conclusion based on induction, not on necessity.
Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely. Sound far fetched? Well, we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that. And to an extremely limited degree, we have succeeded. Of course, we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding, but if we were to eventually do so, then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive? No. WeÂ’d be like Â“immortal mulesÂ”: weÂ’d be alive, yet incapable of reproducing Â… but unlike mules, we wouldnÂ’t need to be continually replaced by reproduction. After all, we could stop reproducing (women might really like that idea!) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist.
Perhaps, though, we Â“immortal mulesÂ”, by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo, would still somehow die: after all, nature shows us that those organisms that donÂ’t adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just donÂ’t last. Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part. This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves, but to improve ourselves as well. Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution, either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations, adapting our bodies to changes in the environment.
And if we ever reach this ultimate goal (is it a good goal?!), then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction .

 The molecular composition of something is not, in general, sufficient to determine its form. 
 
 The morphology of organisms cannot be explained by the action of their genes.","I think this is pointing out that an organism doesn't start as naked DNA, its within a cell that has split off from another organism (possibly developing inside it even) which is being exposed to triggers from the environment.

 The bit where you seem to get confused is to then think what are the triggers acting on? Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way. The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves.
 
 The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see. Genes are turned on, off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects, Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them.

 Michael Ruse:
 
 The most dramatic discoveries in evo-devo have been quite unexpected DNA homologies. It turns out that organisms as different as fruit flies and humans share considerable amounts of practically unaltered DNA, especially those stretches that are involved in development itself--ordering the rates and ways in which the parts of the body are formed (heads before legs and so forth). The jury is still out on the precise significance of all of this. Some seem to think that selection will now have to take a back seat in evolution: ""The homologies of process within morphogenetic fields provide some of the best evidence for evolution just as skeletal and organ homologies did earlier. Thus, the evidence for evolution is better than ever. The role of natural selection in evolution, however, is seen to play less an important role. It is merely a filter for unsuccessful morphologies generated by development. Population genetics is destined to change if it is not to become as irrelevant to evolution as Newtonian mechanics is to contemporary physics","And you know what? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human. One of the reasons they are different, and subject to different epigenetic regimes, is because despite genetic homologies (which evolutionary theory predicts), their genomes are significantly different. They have some different genes, in different quantities, and in different arrangements, and that is critical. Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation.",1

 It is evolution that in reality openly admits that everything came about accidently/randomly through an unknown, undiscoverable and indiscernible series of mutations that just happened to result in the constant and consistent harmonious regulation of life on Earth.

 As for your assertion that evolution is random/accidental, you are, yet again, making a false statement (either through ignorance or deliberate falsehood). Mutation is random, natural selection done by waiting to see which mutation makes survival (and propagation) more likely. There will also be random events such as natural disasters, ice-ages, droughts etc which do introduce a bit of random luck into the equation, but that's about it.

Instead you copped an attitude and responded with snide remarks. You invited the disrespect because you gave none. You are rude and verbally abusive and then play the martyr when you are mocked. We've seen it before. Your behaviour is quite typical of creationists in general, but especially those who can't back up their assertions.
 
 [edit to add] Here's how science works. A scientist makes an observation of some natural event or the effects of some natural event that he/she doesn't understand. Drawing on experience and current theory in that field of science, the scientist formulates a speculative explanation due to natural causes. This is called an hypothesis. If the scientist were to declare, ""It's a miracle!"" then that would shut off all inquiry and place the assertion beyond challenge. That would be giving up. It is important that the hypothesis is open to challenge, that is to say, it must be falsifiable. The scientist then makes a prediction of some potential observation that is a logical requirement of the hypothesis. In other words, the predicted observation must be true if the hypothesis is the correct explanation. This is what I meant when I spoke of predictive value above. The scientist then designs and carries out an experiment that tests whether the observation can be made exactly as predicted. If the scientist is correct, then he publishes his hypothesis in an appropriate scientific journal where his work is evaluated and the testing can be repeated. Sometimes further predictions are made and tested. If the experimentation shows that the hypothesis isn't correct, then it is amended to account for the new experimental data and the process is repeated with further predictions and tests. Sometimes the hypothesis is abandoned entirely.
 
 I certainly hope that your ""proof"" has been subjected to the kind of challenge that scientific theories undergo. Science advances by being challenged. Religion doesn't advance and challenges have resulted in burning at the stake, torture and death.",1
"7361","Hobbes specifically said that this is not the case. Cooperation exists, and is essential. Without it, the life of man would be ""a war of all against all"", and would be ""solitary, nasty, brutish, and short."" But man is inherently, biologically social, at the level of the family and the tribe. Daniel Boone, moving further into the wilderness whenever he could see the smoke from someone else's cabin, or solitary hermits in the desert, are quite rare, and even they are dependent on the rest of society for sustenance. Solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments short of serious physical damage.
 
 Nor is a war of all against all true in evolution. Evolutionary theory includes the evolution of cooperation and altruism along with murder, hunting, and the like. For example, the cooperation of the cells in your body to form organs that support each other, and the mechanism of apoptosis by which most pre-cancerous cells and others that have suffered damage destroy themselves. Or the convergent evolution of numerous species of hive and nest insects (and naked mole rats) from solitary precursors. Or the cooperative evolution of eye and brain structures from light-sensitive cells, or bird's wings along with hollow bones, or symbiosis of all kinds, including intracellular organelles such as mitochondria.

"8024","Modern evolutionary synthesis
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 Jump to: navigation, search
 
 The modern evolutionary synthesis refers to a set of ideas from several biological specialities that were brought together to form a unified theory of evolution accepted by the great majority of working biologists. This synthesis was produced over a period of about a decade (1936-1947) and was closely connected with the development from 1918 to 1932 of the discipline of population genetics, which integrated the theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics.
 
 Julian Huxley invented the term, when he summarised the ideas in his book, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis in 1942. Though the 'Modern Synthesis' is the basis of current evolutionary thinking, it refers to a historical event that took place in the 1930s and 1940s. Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include R. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, George Gaylord Simpson, and G. Ledyard Stebbins.
 
 The modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the specialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of the twentieth century. Discoveries of early geneticists were difficult to reconcile with gradual evolution and the mechanism of natural selection. The synthesis reconciled the two schools of thought, while providing evidence that studies of populations in the field were crucial to evolutionary theory. It drew together ideas from several branches of biology that had become separated, particularly genetics, cytology, systematics, botany, morphology, ecology and paleontology.","And",1
"5014","A large fraction of the noncoding part of a eukaryotic genome is used to make RNA that is sufficiently stable in a cell to be detected by different technological approaches (1-4). The biological significance of this pervasive transcription is unclear and controversial. One possibility is that only very short regions of such unannotated RNA are biologically relevant (5). In-depth characterization of RNAs as to their subcellular compartmentalization, size, modifications, and genomic origins can potentially provide clues to their functions. This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) (long RNAs, lRNAs) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt (short RNAs, sRNAs) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome. First, the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs. Second, these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries. Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with, as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse.","Those who care enough to read the above and understand what the authors have studied will hardly jump on the bandwagon and declare that Genes are Dead.",1

The argument from design is presented as ""proof"" of God or an ""intelligent"" designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't ""proof"". Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.
 
 Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way.

However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.
 
 Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe. Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.
 
 Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:
 
 1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.
 2. The earth is about six thousand years old.
 3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.
 4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.
 5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.
 6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.
 
 None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:
 
 1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design. 
 2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity. 
 3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. 
 4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.",1

 here that pain can arise from both material and from non-material causes. 
 O.K. A physical (or material) cause of pain would probably be associated with
 some kind of pathology, injury, auto-immune system disorder etc. - so there
 should be an organic explanation for it and there usually is. Sometimes no
 such explanation can be found and this may be down to limitations in 
 the present state of medical knowledge (which you say is beside the point).
 Now pain that has no apparent physical cause you seem say can be identified 
 by psychologists has having a non-material origin. The kind of non-material
 origin that you mention ""the power of the mind"" is really a catch-all explanation 
 that explains nothing. If you know of any non-physical causes of pain,
 please specify.",1

 I'm actually speaking from experience. I didn't dream this stuff up. I've lived it. I used to have a condition called chronic prostatitis...which is an inflammation of the prostate that often happens in young men. This is not a medically curable condition. Doctors often throw antibiotics at it, but most men don't respond to that. As a result there are thousands of men around the country who live in constant, chronic debilitating pain. I used to be one of them. But no longer. I learned the secret, which is to eliminate junk foods and sugars. After just a couple weeks of doing this my constant pain just seemed to evaporate. I have never looked back.

 In the last debate tournament, they had a time limit of 5 days between posts, and the posters went quicker than that. Even with an unforseen problem which caused a delay, the whole thing went just 33? days start to finish. 
 
 When there is a time limit of days, or hours, it can make things unpredictable because if one person posts early, then any kind of projections about when it will be done can be thrown off. Also, it could make the deadline for you fall on a Friday, which I'm guessing would be bad for your schedule. My suggestion would be to simply set days of the week (at midnight?) so that if one person posts early, it just gives his opponent that much more time. Is there no way you can post once a week, with your deadline being midnight on Sunday? If you could do that, my deadline could be Wednesday night. I work sometimes long and unpredictable hours during the week, but I can guarantee after your Sunday post, I'll have something up by midnight Wednesday. Then you would have untill the following Sunday. You would have 4 days, including two weekend days, to come up with yours, and I would have 3 weekdays. I think that's more than fair.

 William Demski, one of the ""founding fathers"" of the Intelligent Design movement, once wrote a review of a book about the Bible Code. Remember that his followers call him the Isaac Newton of Information Theory and he is supposed to be a great mathematician and theologian.
 
 It is here and here.
 
 There is a blog post about it here.
 
 When I first read this review, I rolled on the floor laughing (on the inside), and then I cried a little (on the inside). I cried because so many people fall prey to this charlatan, who doesn't really believe what he preaches, but knows he makes buckets of duckets by writing books and giving lectures and keeping people interested in the ""debate"" over evolution. 
 
 I think the blog post says it all, but I have to put something here.
 
 I'll just post all the lines that made me chuckle.
 
 Since skip codes can also work on just about any piece of literature, I suppose that Moby Dick and War and Peace are also time capsules capable of predicting the future. 
 
 That's right. It's either chance or non-human intelligence. No other choices are possible. Brilliant.
 
 This one is the best! Since it must be a non-human intelligence and since the Bible talks about YHWH, the non-human intelligence talking to us through a time capsule must be YHWH. It is most certainly not Satan or the Flying Spaghetti Monster, to wit. 
 
 
 
 This just happens to be one of my favorite ID concepts. The concept of impossible improbabilities. If it is unlikely, then it is impossible. 
 
 Oh but wait, he covers his tracks a bit later.
 
 
 Oh my, but isn't you're whole endeavor to say that life has a small p-value, therefore could not have possible arisen by chance. 
 
 I just happen to dispute the low p-value of life arising. Not only do evolutionists usually not accept a low p-value for life forming, we Pastafarians also do not accept it, since we know that there is 100% chance of the FSM creating life with His Noodly Appendage.
 
 Then he starts equating the Bible Code (which has been debunked, I mean seriously debunked, start here). In my mind, if the Isaac Newton of Information Theory says, ""At the same time that research in the Bible Code has taken off, research in a seemingly unrelated field has taken off as well, namely, biological design. These two fields are in fact closely related...The relevant statistical methodology is identical for both fields,"" and I say that if one of those methodologies has been debunked, then so has the other. 
 
 I think William Demski and other founding fathers of ID creationism are the movement's worst enemies. They contradict themselves repeatedly and usually their words can easily be used against them to refute or debunk ID itself, and I don't mean by quote mining or any other creationist tactic. On one hand there is Michael Behe, who under oath claimed that in order for ID to fit a definition of science, that definition also had to be broad enough to include astrology, and on the other hand there is William Demski, who claims that ID and the Bible Code follow the same statistical methodology and are very closely related. To me, it looks like these guys should be telling fortunes, not lobbying school boards. Well, I do suppose they are mostly sticking to selling books and lecturing for $200 an hour, so you've got to give them credit for keeping up the sham for so long.
 
 I'd really love it if someone got on this board and tried to defend the Bible Code or William Demksi's apparent endorsement of it.","Just about any phrase you want can come up with a bible code, right? Is there a program out there than looks for specific phrases with gaps ??

 Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.","What you are talking about is irreducible complexity; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal.
 
 I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point. 
 
 I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.
 
 They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence, but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth, but it's also evidence for the earth spinning.
 
 Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement ""life forms are similar to other life forms"", This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well.
 
 Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology, direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation, it would have to be original useful DNA, or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination.",1

TQ doesn&#8217;t, and of course he&#8217;ll tell you that I don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel &#8220;intellectually fulfilled&#8221;, to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn&#8217;t written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He&#8217;s become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. Read &#8220;The Edge of Evolution&#8221;, or &#8220;Darwin&#8217;s Black Box&#8221; sometime. :)","Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant.

Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong.

 That's one issue of one journal, out of many. Now let's compare that to the output in the one and only ID journal (ISCID ""PCID"") over the last few years:",1
"9630","Hi all,
 
 I decided to start a thread to see what folks had to say about fossilization.
 
 I'll start by saying that, as I understand it, death is certain and fossilization of the remains is highly uncommon. An animal or plant dies and immediately scavengers, animals plants and bacteria, start the process of reclaiming materials from the carcass. There is very little chance of any part of the organism to be left to fossilize. Unless the carcass was relatively quickly protected from scavenger organisms, there is hardly any chance it will form a fossil. So, maybe most fossils we see are the result of a tragic, untimely death.
 
 Is this evidence for the flood?","Well by the Flood, I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis?
 
 Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved. Also, you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates, which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons. In that regard, some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material.
 
 There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like ""tragic"" Unusual? sometimes. In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt.
 
 Also, there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber, tarpit ""traps"" like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments (off the top of my head). Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow, low energy deposition of sediments, like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen.",1
"8381","How can there be a gap in a theory that does not discuss what that subject in which the gap resides? 
 
 Evolution is the study of the change in allele frequencies. Non-life does not have alleles. Therefore evolution cannot address or study the origins of life as those do not have alleles. You cannot have a gap in something you do not study. Your argument is like saying that subject X is a gap in accounting when subject X is clearly a marketing issue. 
 
 For someone who criticizes those who study and accept evolution for not studying ID, you seem to be guilty of the same.","So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here? If you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion. I recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life. Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence.

"1616","I see that no one has responded to the primary point of the post - that being that as Evolution is a naturalistic science and is, by definition, exclusionary to the supernatural, it cannot be used to prove or disprove creation. 
 
 Equally, as (young earth) creation is based on the Bible, and therefore rules out a completely naturalistic means to life as it exists today, it also cannot be used to prove or disprove evolution. 
 
 The two ideas are alternatives to each other, not proofs against one another. 
 
 Frequently in creation vs evolution discussions I see 'creation is wrong because x,y,z aspects of evolution disprove it'. Or, 'evolution is wrong because x.y.z aspects of creation disprove it'. This, however is fallicious. The ideas are merely alternatives. 
 
 Can we agree that the merit of each theory is separate and must stand on it's own evidence irrespective of the other theory?","I think i disagree with the majority of people that have already posted here. evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive, and the both cannot be true at the same time, since there can be only one true way that life originated (even though i know that ""evolution"" is not the correct term to describe the origin of life, and die-hard evolutionist might chew me out for using it wrongly. I prefer to use the term ""spontaneous origin"" rather than ""evolution""). since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist, then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other. and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth, then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theories

"5247","So, I could certainly see, if variation was truly random that selection could theoretically pick from a pool of random variants. Unfortunately for evolutionists, the concept of randomness when it comes to new traits has never actually been proven. In fact, whenever animals experience an environmental shift, they have this bad habit of shifting right along with it, starting with an internal response from each creature who somehow ""senses"" this change. It's hardly logical to call this random. 
 
 But if each individual of a population experiences the same environmental cue, and each member simultaneously evolves the same traits epigenetically, not only will this speed up evolution exponentially, but it will also give each member the same traits at the same time -- which ultimately gives them the same basic fitness ----- which undermines natural selection, making mortality/breeding success mostly a lottery of circumstance, with a little sexual selection thrown in.","Well, yes, but this begs the question of whether, even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real, all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations.
 
 Now, I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance. But even if it were true it wouldn't do away with natural selection. Just as with basic genetic mutation, which isn't going to go away, one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to. This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.
 
 Of course, if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment, i.e. are teleological in origin, then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs. Until they do, there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all.",1

 In my latter ID days, I was arguing for a form of Directed Panspermia, with the aliens themselves having arisen by purely natural means - starting off as simpler organisms than us, but then evolving intelligence - and then creating life as we know it. Without getting into details, imagine what we humans will probably due in 100 years or so: create a new form of life (robotic) that is vastly different than our own and probably more complex. And it is a form of life we would be more likely to send out into space than ourselves, and that is better suited for being send out to other planets than we are. Analogously, imagine a form of alien life unlike that as we know it creating bacterial life and then sending it out in spaceships to populate other worlds. With our form of life being designed by a different form of life and rocketed here, that would be intelligent design of life as we know it.
 
 However, that is NOT what the ID movement holds ID to be: their's is a religious position down to its core, as became even more clear in the Dover, PA court case.
 
 
 Also, one could argue that Intelligent Design is a fact. When humans create a novel amino acid sequence, or modify a bacterium to perform a specific target function, then we are practicing intelligent design in biology. But that is NOT what the ID movement means. Theirs is a religious position that uses human design as an analogy, not as their goal.
 
 
 As far as Behe's ID, he made it clear in his Darwins' Black Box and in court in the Dover, PA case that he can't say much of anything about ID. He can't tell WHEN the designs were created, HOW the designs were instantiated, by WHOM or ""WHOMS"" the designs were created, or WHERE the designs and instantiations occurred. He's got 0 details.

You can get a hint of how the ""queen of the sciences"" operated by the fact that Copernicus (a priest) withheld publication of his heliocentric theory until he was quite certain that he was close to death; in fact, legend has it that he saw the first copy on the morning of his death. He knew what the consequences of his theory, that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the ""queen of the sciences"", would be. Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the ""queen of the sciences.""

 Creationists know that there is something seriously wrong with the radio-metric dating methods.

Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old! Now this alone is a big flaw. Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out, it should be less than 200 years. The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years, because even after several hundreds of thousands of years, there will be no more radio-carbon left.
 The above came from Snelling, A., ""Dating Dilemma: Fossil wood in ""ancient"" sandstone"", Creation  21(3):39-41.
 
 Creationists don't have (by their own admissions) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods, but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions.

 Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true.

 Hi jo;
 
 Going by your various posts that I've read, I think that you are probably a person that I could like and whose opinions I could respect. But quite frankly, on the issue of darwinism and the way darwinists play sly games with the English language, corrupting trhe language to suit their ideology, you seem to have been very much duped by their semantic dishonesty.
 
 ""Genetic determinism"" and ""neo-darwinism"" are terms that, as a result of constant and perpetual darwinist equivocation are among those that no longer have one, single, and definite meaning among those that employ them. That is, you can never be sure what they mean when darwinists employ them.
 
 What do they mean when you use them?
 
 IAC, if 'genetic determinism' depends upon the linear chemical process of one gene maps to one protein [it is now known that this is not the case], then a 'theory' of evolution dependent upon phenotypic mutations determined by genotypic mutations is plausible, [not necessarily true, but plausible], even when the genotypic mutations are accidental/undirected/random. But such a ""theory"", [that is, a hypothesis whereby the origin/evolution of biological novelty and increased sytematic complexity and productivity is held to be directly and linearly and mechanically and deterministically traceable to accidental genetic alterations], becomes entirely implausible when you have ""multi-purpose genes"", and whole genomes self-organising their own genetic 'pieces'. Then phenotypic expression is not the sum, or anything like, the deterministic linear outcome of any given mutated gene, or collection of mutated genes, taken together. The entire fisherian notion of ""Random genetic mutation as the source of adaptive phenotypic traits"" goes straight down the tubes,-- just as it always should have done, from day one.
 
 But now you are back to where Darwin was, 150 years ago--he had no explanation for the ORIGINS of species. All he had was a mechanism [""NS""] for the numerical distribution [aka 'fitness'] of species. That ""theory"" can ""explain"" [well, not really :)] why some species are plentiful, while others are extinct, but it cannot and does not explain how they 'evolved' in the first place. It was because Darwin had this fact rubbed in his face by his contemporaries that he cribbed from Lamarck, and came up with a 'theory' of origins that he called, 'pangenesis'. And without ""RM"", latterday darwinists are in the same position neo-darwinists were in prior to fisherism's 'modern synthesis'. They have no mechanism for the origin of traits [evolution], but only one for the preservation and distribution of traits [inheritance, heretibility, conservation]. And a very nebulous 'mechanism' that is, anyway.
 
 Now you may be among those who conveniently forget or ignore the fact that ""NS"" does not, and cannot, account for evolution, i.e., the origins of species, but some of us refuse to do that, despite much pressure from darwinists. And we have been ""recalling"" that fact on a regular basis for 150+ years.",1

"5155","There's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and I'm about to exploit it.
 
 I've mentioned this before, but truly, mountains of books could be written on this subject. The subject, of course, is the illusion of evolution. My contention is that much of what is perceived as ""evolution"" is not actually not evolution at all.
 
 Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of ""evolution."" Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on. Regardless, each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring. On one side you have Darwinists, who claim that evolution is a two-step process. First there's random genetic mutation, and that's followed up by non-random natural selection....the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental ""fitness"" to their offspring. Lamarckian inheritance, on the other hand, is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment, adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny.
 
 But there's a hole. A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit. And this hole bypasses both theories. What's the hole? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for ""evolution."" In other words, populational evolution does not require traits to be ""passed on."" This mantra is a giant straw man, as you will soon see, because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution.
 
 The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record. But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype. Not only that, but there's also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired. 
 
 It's well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program, internal signals from the mother, and external signals from the environment. Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly. Therefore, the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance. This is known as differentiation, and is simply the convergence of an organism's genes and environment during development. Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon.
 
 As well, tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads, it's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size, shape, color, hatch times and general size of the organism. 
 
 (Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges? Since they had a slightly protruding face (as many in Europe still do), the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat (vigorous chewing) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones, this diet help dictate their morphology.)
 
 But it's not just tadpoles........
 
 As well, rodents, will dine on a variety of seeds and nuts...as youngsters, if a population of mice come across a new food supply, they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet. If this food is different than what their parents' ate, their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents. This new morphology would follow them until adulthood. If the food supply stuck around long enough time, it could give the appearance that the population was ""evolving."" But genetics would have nothing to do with it - instead, it would simply be a cultural, environmental phenomenon. It's an environmental evolution, of sorts. Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new, beneficial morphologies without it. Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself --- which says that new, beneficial traits have to be ""passed on."" This is a bogus premise from the very start because it's not necessary for traits to be ""passed on"" for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that's needed is, in this case, for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which, of course, would carry on those particular traits.
 
 ""We think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking,"" Dr. Meaney said. In perilous times, mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less. When there are fewer dangers around, the mothers may lick more. [/COLOR]
 
 Really the sky's the limit; diet, terrain, movement, predators, weather, availability of resources, etc. Life is not about genes, Life is about life. The designer didn't create animals adapted to specific environments, He created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment.
 
 This is not ""evolution"" it's an adaptive response. Of course, some say new beak shapes could have formed during development, but either way, selection is not required....it would be similar situation to the butterfly example I gave above. This of course, is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be ""passed on."" Traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution.
 
 
 And what's interesting is Gould's explanation for why Lamarckism is false...this is very interesting and ties in directly to this:
 
 
 Of course, Gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly. The straw man is that it's not necessary pass on traits, for the reasons stated above....and it is not necessary that ""environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions."" Life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive...and adaptations start during development -- where his eyes couldn't see -- or didn't want to. Life changes so rapidly -- if you blink you miss it!
 
 Stephen, I know you're dead, but if you can somehow hear me, please note you have made a great error.....you have a giant hole in your theory, which I have just exploited. It's called ""The Environmental Evolution Revolution.""
 
 Not only have I undercut your snails but I've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books. Evolution surely has a heritable component, but a huge portion of what is perceived as ""evolution"" in the field is not that at all. It's merely an illusion...and upon close inspection it disappears altogether....just like your theory. You see, there is NO EVIDENCE for natural selection sifting through random mutations. What is seen in the field today is not evidence for that, it's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature.","This is a very interesting post.

"3595","Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned. Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so.

"8797","The Bible says, ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth"" (Genesis 1 :1). The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning.","Many (all?) other religions have the idea of a creation event by one or more gods at the beginning. Why would the author single out just one religion and ignore all others? Further ""the athiest"" gave up the idea of the universe having always been decades ago. The author is disingenuous - or ill-informed - when he suggests otherwise.
 
 At the end of a big waffle about the ""big bang"" and thermodynamics, the author asserts that ""The atheist's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong. The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct."" and then leaps to ""If we know the creation has a beginning..."" So suddenly ""the universe"" becomes ""creation"" and the ""study"" continues confident that it has established biblical creation is ""scientifically correct"".
 
 The article then moves on to offer a series of unsupported assertions that for ""creation"" (ie the universe) to not have a cause, all of our ""laws of conservation of angular momentum"" and our ""laws of conservation of electric charge"" would have to be wrong. No supporting evidence is offered for these bold claims. Thus, the bible's caused beginning (again other religions are ignored) fits with ""the available scientific evidence"". Handy eh? 
 
 So now we ""know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused"" (we know no such thing, but the author marches confidently on anyway) we move onto design. Here an appeal to incredulity fallacy is neatly tied in with gross distortion of the anthropic principle and another false dichotomy to claim that everything must be designed because it couldn't happen by chance.
 
 The next step is to claim that the author has shown practical proof of the Chrisian God's existence (other gods being ignored once more). How such a piece of poorly argued philosophy can be viewed as ""practical"" isn't explained. Then it neatly guides the reader to the shop by the exit: ""We have books, audio tapes, video tapes, correspondence courses, and booklets available and all can be obtained on loan without cost. Just request our catalog from...""
 
 In summary, the ""study"" offers up the same old sleight-of-hand ""logic"" that typifies ""proofs"" of deities, creation, design etc. It isn't as bad as some though as it contains only small levels of dishonesty. It is a blatant piece of marketing though aimed at selling books, videos etc to the gullible.",1

 Murder could be traced back to the ""ruthless evolutionary drive to reproduce"", he said.
 
 Thousands of years ago killing an enemy would boost a man's social status and improve his chances of attracting a mate, the book argued.
 
 Murderers' genes won the evolutionary battle over those of their victims and the instinct to kill now lies dormant in all of us, Prof Buss argued.
 
 I don't want to comment on Buss's argument as I have not read the book. Nevertheless, since it is so easy to create a new field of scientific exploration about human behavior using Darwin's theory, I am inspired to try my hand at it.","This can only be plausible if the victims were killed before they reproduced.

 RNA Maps Reveal New RNA Classes and a Possible Function for Pervasive Transcription

 Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.","And the introductory paragraph is interesting also.",1

"4543","Now, anthropology, archeology, and forensics are constantly deciding that entities are manufactured by an intelligent entity -- humans in this case. Are you trying to tell me that anthropologists have no basis for looking at a stone and concluding it was manufactured -- designed -- as a tool? I would hope not.","But you know that this is not what I was saying: We have a basis for comparison.",1
"4074","Not sure what you mean. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations. Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics. There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity, and, of course, there are mechanisms that tend to increase it.","I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to ""evolve"" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations. 
 
 Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.
 
 Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes:
 LL - Long fur.
 Ll - Medium fur sizes.
 ll - Short fur sizes.
 
 where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.
 
 Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes:
 LL - Long fur.
 
 We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.
 
 Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome.",1
"3642","Evolutionarily speaking, it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis (monkey) population. The oldest Homo erectus fossil is dated at just under 2 million years old....the oldest Homo habilis fossil (primate) is dated at just over 2 million years old. The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years (evolutinists time clock). Therefore common sense says that homo erectus (human) could never have evolved from homo habilis (monkey). Not only that, but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years. Thus, there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred.","Yes, homo habilus was a monkey.

 Darwin warned against allowing ""the weak members of civilised societies [to] propagate their kind""
 ""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.""

 ""Haeckel was the chief apostle of evolution in Germany. Nordenskiold (1929) argues that he was even more influential than Darwin in convincing the world of the truth of evolution. ...

His evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a ""just"" state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others; the irrational mysticism that had always stood in strange communion with his brave words about objective science-all contributed to the rise of Nazism. The Monist League that he had founded and led, though it included a wing of pacifists and leftists, made a comfortable transition to active support for Hitler."" (Gould, Stephen J.

 (there is a lot at the above site that I don't agree with - I use it because I feel that the best place to get an undisputed description OF the opposition is FROM the opposition)
 
 Studies of the origin of the first life form, the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design. Of the several ""different scientific diciplines"" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the ""different scientific diciplines"" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which ""theory of evolution"" is clearly not? How about ""happenstance origins""? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does ""happenstance origins"" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science?

 Gould:
 
 The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics - the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation - are random, in the special sense of ""not inherently directed toward adaptation."" That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur""at random,"" in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction - and be the creative force of evolution - by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.",1

Mole Rats are another group of mammals who are unable to regulate their body temperature, however, since they live underground, the temperature of their environment does not change much. Some warm-blooded animals, such as bears, groundhogs, gophers and bats hibernate during the cold winter. During hibernation these animals live off of stored body fat and can drop their body temperatures by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The Hawk Moth is an insect which can raise its body temperature well above the temperature of its surroundings when it is flying because of its huge wing muscles which generate heat when in use.

 Where did Man descend from, if he didn't descend from Monkey?","There are two major theories, many hold to the ""Out of Africa"" replacement model.
 
 The perspective of the Out of Africa model (often called Out of Africa II, referring to a second migration from Africa of a hominid population) adherents is that when there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa into Asia and Europe, these populations (seen in materials like the Chinese and Indonesian erectus) did not contribute a significant amount of genetic material to later populations that led to modern humans (some claim no genetic ancestry to these groups and their descendants at all, a ""strict"" replacement model). At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective. In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa, and this population is the forerunner of modern humans, leaving the European Neanderthals, Chinese erectus, and others out in the cold.

 Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.

 Fish/Amphibian 
 Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians: 
 Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis) 
 Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other group of lobe-finned fish). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth. 
 Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet. 
 Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.

"7505","To apathy:
 Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. 
 
 Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. 
 
 An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.
 
 So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.

The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.
 What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.

 For some time, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of today's apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans, probably six million, maybe four million years ago. More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species, just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes.
 
 And certain similarities between the two species, scientists say, go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs.
 
 Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent. They make and use simple tools, hunt in groups and engage in aggressive, violent acts.
