This made the work initially difficult to publish, notes Huang.

Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete.

"3867","The modern evolutionary synthesis (often referred to simply as the new synthesis, the modern synthesis, the evolutionary synthesis, neo-Darwinian synthesis or neo-Darwinism), generally denotes the integration of Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution of species by natural selection, Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance, random genetic mutation as the source of variation, and mathematical population genetics. Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include Thomas Hunt Morgan, R. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, George Gaylord Simpson, and G. Ledyard Stebbins.
 
 Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries: the units of evolution (genes) and the mechanism of evolution (selection). It also represents a unification of several branches of biology that previously had little in common, particularly genetics, cytology, systematics, botany, and paleontology.","and further:",1,2

 But you need to understand that science isn't ""TRUTH."" It is a process that tries to explain the physical world by observation, hypothesis, prediction and testing. Where we are still accumulating data there may be more than one hypothesis that adequately explains the data. That there are conflicting hypotheses on minor points isn't meaningful to the underlying theory. That's how science works. When someone enumerates conflicting hypotheses of science, you should doubt their motives, especially when they don't explain why it is meaningful. Be especially wary when they list debunked hypotheses as if they meant something.

"8415","A very small fraction of our genetic material--about 2%-- performs the crucial task scientists once thought was the sole purpose of the genome: to serve as a blueprint for the production of proteins, the molecules that make cells work and sustain life. This 2% of human DNA is converted into intermediary molecules called RNAs, which in turn carry instructions within cells for protein manufacture.
 ""And what of the other 98% of the genome? It has been assumed by many to be genetic junk, a massive accumulation of ""code"" that evolution has rendered superfluous. Now, however, scientists are discovering that the vast bulk of the DNA in our genomes, while it does not ""code"" for the specific RNA molecules that serve as templates for protein synthesis, do nevertheless perform various kinds of work.""","It is not only supposedly ""junk DNA"" that was used for these kind of arguments. The vertebrate eye has been preached to be a bad design. Why? Why is it a bad design?
 
 The human eye contain bona fide optical fibers to conduct light (nice illustration). Besides the design arose 40-60 times during evolution, like evolution was biased (converged on an optimal design) towards such a structure. So why is it sub optimal? Are proponents of these arguments going to suggest a better design with all the blueprints? Thought not, arguments from ignorance are short on design :p.
 
 Why was it suggested that the appendix is useless and functionless, instead of just admitting ""we are still looking into it"".
 A few articles discussing its function:
 1) Dasso JF. Howell MD. 1997. ""Neonatal appendectomy impairs mucosal immunity in rabbits."" Cellular Immunology. 182(1):29-37.
 2) Dasso JF. Obiakor H. Bach H. Anderson AO. Mage RG. 2000. ""A morphological and immunohistological study of the human and rabbit appendix for comparison with the avian bursa."" Developmental & Comparative Immunology. 24:8:797-814.

 4) Weinstein PD. Mage RG. Anderson AO. 1994. ""The appendix functions as a mammalian bursal equivalent in the developing rabbit."" Advances in Experimental Medicine & Biology. 355:249-53.
 5) A more detailed survey of the evidence, with numerous references to other technical literature, showing that the appendix is not a vestigial organ can be found in J.W. Glover, The Human Vermiform Appendix-a General Surgeon's Reflections, CEN Technical Journal, 3:31-38, 1988.
 
 In short:
 The appendix contains a high concentration of very specialized structures called lymphoid follicles (also found throughout the GIT). Lymphoid follicles in the appendix produce cells that produce antibodies that control which essential bacteria come to reside in the caecum and colon in neonatal life. The ""strategic"" placement of the appendix is important during the development of neonatal life in the setup of healthy intestinal flora therefore neonatal appendectomy will impair mucosal immunity. ""The appendix's job is to reboot the digestive system..."" and ""acts as a good safe house for bacteria,"".
