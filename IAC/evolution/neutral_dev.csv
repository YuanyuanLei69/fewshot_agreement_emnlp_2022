 The change typically doesn't show up in the genes.

Environmental factors, such as temperature and embryonic diet, prompt genetic activity that ends up casting one bee a worker and the other a guard. 
 
 If beneficial, this flexibility could be passed on to offspring and so can lead to the evolution of new features in a species.

Some people would argue that killing another human being would be a morally good thing to do in certain circumstances. Other people would argue that killing people is not inherently 'right' or 'wrong.' Whose to say that your assertion is any better than anyone else's? Where do we find a universal truth that says, ""Killing another individual is always wrong... no exceptions""?
 
 The absolute truth in this situation is that if you kill another individual, then that individual is physically dead. They are no longer living and breathing. That's fact. That's truth. By definition. Any assignment of value to the act of killing is opinion. Perhaps many people share your opinion, but it is still opinion.

 Barbarian, regarding mutations:
 There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation.
