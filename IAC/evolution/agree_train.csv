"67461","Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. 
 
 When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions.

 Ok, getting off my soapbox now, I'd say you're totally right. Certain branches of Christianity, like Catholisism, have traditionally been very resistant to change. Unwilling to adapt, one might say. And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late. The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists, and so it isn't doing as well. We also see lots of little churches springing up, filling religious enviromental niches, as it were. 
 
 What can we predict for the future? Here's my guess. The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas. As communication and travel become easier, people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures, and religions will be forced to deal with people saying ""Yeah, but what about this new idea I just heard? How does that fit in?"" On the other hand, as people get exposed to other ideas, they'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to. Sort of a psychological anchor. 
 
 I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away, as people become exposed to more, different ideas. If you can't adapt, you become extinct. Churches that espouse firm moral ideas based on humanisitic reasoning will probably do well.",2

 This is the first definitioin, let me know if you disagree and you think one of the lower definitions is the correct one, but they don't seem to pertain to actual science in the classroom (packing a suitcase down to a science, etc.)
 
 Science is not ""a murky combination of facts and theories"" in the classroom, but the evidence is taught along with the theories. It is taught that theories are not fact but that they basically mean that the conclusion reached with the evidence we have right now is that theory, since no one has falsified it, and all predictions made have been correct.","The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted.

Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague. 
 
 The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it.

In adult birds and mammals, in which lungs oxygenate the blood, such a system makes little sense - but all six pairs of aortic arches are formed in mammalian and avian embryos before the system eventually becomes simplified into a single aortic arch. Thus, even though our physiology does not require such a structure, our embryonic condition reflects our evolutionary history."" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p500)","Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!
 
 Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.
 
 The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.
 
 PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Of course this ""law"" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development.",2

 I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name ""Steve"" (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm.

However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory.

 now bear in mind that all this happened in one day (day 6). How many species of animals can a man name in a day?
 
 OK, Noah is 9 generations after Adam, and according to the story, a generation was like 200 years on average, plus at the time Noah built the ark, he was some 200 something himself (cant remember the exact figure). so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day. Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.

It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.
 
 From article 3
 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including:
 A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred.
 B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.
 
 Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.
 
 In article nr.4 
 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed. The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic (biosynthetically restricted) relationships between amino acids.

 Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts.
 
 Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction.

This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category.

"59981","What is science?
The first place to start is with a definition of science. Many exist, but most of them come down to something like, Â“If something is scientific, it is observable and testable (i.e., able to be repeated).Â”
Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is. However, if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement. In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research, I canÂ’t ever recall anyone telling me what science is (and isnÂ’t!), showing me what it is, or providing me with an explanation of how it operates. If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me, I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is Â“scientific.Â” After a pause, most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than Â“It is what scientists do.Â”
As an undergraduate, I was taught to remember, not to think. Sure, I was given tools which I could use to think, but I wasnÂ’t actually taught to think. Then, as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field (as do all Ph.D. researchers), and so the breadth of a question like Â“What is the definition of scientific?Â” was absolutely irrelevant to me. Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists, the question has never arisen, nor apparently needed to have been asked. My point is that most scientists donÂ’t really know what is or isnÂ’t scientific, because it rarely affects what they do.
Why make a big deal of this? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and, to know this, you need to know what science isÂ—and as we have seen, most scientists donÂ’t.
Neither Â“processÂ” is currently observable, testable or repeatable. Please note that when speaking of evolution, I am talking of the appearance of new (not rearranged) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information. I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals. When talking about evolution, I am not speaking of natural selection, which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species. Creationists, of course, have not the slightest problem with natural selection. After all, it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these. Anyway, the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle.","http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...sd/grocott.asp
So who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.

 I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.
 
 A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.
 
 Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being.","And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was ""I do not believe in a personal god"", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best.",2

 Secondly be careful in the use of the term creationist- remember AiG are Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a whole- there are Christians who accept the analysis of science yet still see the universe as the creation of God (ie. Old Earth Creationists).
 
 This is significant as it is important to drive the point home that YEC does not speak on behalf of all Christians (as it likes to make out), but are a group on the fringe whose position is seen as ridiculous by Christian and non-Christian alike. Put this to them and you force them to start attacking fellow Christians.

"2260","The genetic code has the remarkable property of error minimization, whereby the arrangement of amino acids to codons is highly efficient at reducing the deleterious effects of random point mutations and transcriptional and translational errors. Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear. Here, three scenarios of genetic code evolution are examined, and their effects on error minimization assessed. First, a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization. Second, a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model. Finally, a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids. Under certain conditions, 22% of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code. These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally, simply as a consequence of code expansion, facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes. This implies that selection is at best only partly responsible for the property of error minimization. These results caution against assuming that selection is responsible for every beneficial trait observed in living organisms.","Also form the article:",2

"68932","Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.
 
 We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.","Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.",2

 Science is not ""a murky combination of facts and theories"" in the classroom, but the evidence is taught along with the theories.

 The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it.

Meanwhile, there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content.

Miseta [10] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship between molecules, the intermediates of glucose degradation, as precursors of precursor amino acids, and the organisation of the genetic code. This observation is also analysed by Taylor and Coates [11] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway, the citric acid cycle, the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic code (Fig. 1) and, in particular, they point out that (i) all the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family tend to have codons with the same first base (Fig. 1) and (ii) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the beginning of the pathway head (Fig. 1)[11]. More recently, Davis [12,13] has provided evidence that tRNAs descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids, suggesting their importance in genetic code origin.","Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?

Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear. Here, three scenarios of genetic code evolution are examined, and their effects on error minimization assessed. First, a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization. Second, a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model. Finally, a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids. Under certain conditions, 22% of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code. These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally, simply as a consequence of code expansion, facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes. This implies that selection is at best only partly responsible for the property of error minimization. These results caution against assuming that selection is responsible for every beneficial trait observed in living organisms.","Also form the article:",2

"2443","Luria-Delbruck experiment (1943) (also called the Fluctuation Test) demonstrates that in bacteria, genetic mutations arise in the absence of selection, rather than being a response to selection. Therefore, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to higher organisms. These experiments also introduced the microbiological method of replica plating. Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work.
 In their experiment, Luria and Delbruck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes. After a period of growth, they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage (virus) containing agar. If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria, then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbruck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.
 Luria and Delbruck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes. Delbruck developed a sophisticated mathematical model based on this hypothesis that was entirely consistent with these results. The conclusion was that mutations in bacteria, like higher organisms, are random rather than directed.","And from here: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC1aRandom.shtml",2

"73951","Intrigued, as always I went to dig a little deeper into the methods used. Generally speaking, one of the best dating methods for an amphibolite metamorphic rock would be to separate out amphiboles for Ar-Ar dating. Using the argon-argon variant of K-Ar allows many cross checks for excess argon or argon loss that are invisible to standard K-Ar dating. At the very least, a better approach would be to date the rocks using individual minerals. The worst possible method would be to measure the age on an inhomogeneous whole rock sample. In the footnotes, the methods are described as follows:
 
Whole rock' samples were analyzed in all cases-K-Ar at Activation Laboratories, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb at the PRISE Laboratory, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

"22602","The genetic code has the remarkable property of error minimization, whereby the arrangement of amino acids to codons is highly efficient at reducing the deleterious effects of random point mutations and transcriptional and translational errors. Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear. Here, three scenarios of genetic code evolution are examined, and their effects on error minimization assessed. First, a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization. Second, a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model. Finally, a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids. Under certain conditions, 22% of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code. These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally, simply as a consequence of code expansion, facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes. This implies that selection is at best only partly responsible for the property of error minimization. These results caution against assuming that selection is responsible for every beneficial trait observed in living organisms.","Also form the article:",2

 the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23
 
 now bear in mind that all this happened in one day (day 6). How many species of animals can a man name in a day?
 
 OK, Noah is 9 generations after Adam, and according to the story, a generation was like 200 years on average, plus at the time Noah built the ark, he was some 200 something himself (cant remember the exact figure). so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day. Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.

 Ok, getting off my soapbox now, I'd say you're totally right. Certain branches of Christianity, like Catholisism, have traditionally been very resistant to change. Unwilling to adapt, one might say. And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late. The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists, and so it isn't doing as well. We also see lots of little churches springing up, filling religious enviromental niches, as it were. 
 
 What can we predict for the future? Here's my guess. The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas. As communication and travel become easier, people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures, and religions will be forced to deal with people saying ""Yeah, but what about this new idea I just heard? How does that fit in?"" On the other hand, as people get exposed to other ideas, they'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to. Sort of a psychological anchor. 
 
 I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away, as people become exposed to more, different ideas. If you can't adapt, you become extinct. Churches that espouse firm moral ideas based on humanisitic reasoning will probably do well.",2

"40","It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution. If there was no Adam, there was no original sin, and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis, only monkeys. Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus, he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements. Then ALL the basics of Christianity, the nature of God and central New Testament teachings, including the way the sinner Adam (one man)and the Savior Jesus (one man) are linked together in Romans 5, 16-18, are trivialized just the way atheists love.

 I wish to wave the flag for the middle ground. I do not believe that the Bible is 100% accurate historically. I do believe that many events (including the flood) happened in some form or other and many of these are long-ago racial memories which may well have been enhanced/distorted/spun over the course of millenia.
 
 Trying to date the early parts of the Bible is effectively impossible. It is hard enough later on even at the time of the 'slavery' in Egypt.
 
 Much more interesting to try and workout what may have happened.","I think that this is my view of it all as well. A lot of the events of the bible (mainly the old testament) are things that might have occured in one form or another, and much of the events of the New Testament DID occur.
 
 An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen. It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a ""500-year-flood"" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character. Eventually over the millenia, it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world. Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh, which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today.",2

"59982","What is science?
The first place to start is with a definition of science. Many exist, but most of them come down to something like, Â“If something is scientific, it is observable and testable (i.e., able to be repeated).Â”
Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is. However, if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement. In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research, I canÂ’t ever recall anyone telling me what science is (and isnÂ’t!), showing me what it is, or providing me with an explanation of how it operates. If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me, I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is Â“scientific.Â” After a pause, most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than Â“It is what scientists do.Â”
As an undergraduate, I was taught to remember, not to think. Sure, I was given tools which I could use to think, but I wasnÂ’t actually taught to think. Then, as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field (as do all Ph.D. researchers), and so the breadth of a question like Â“What is the definition of scientific?Â” was absolutely irrelevant to me. Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists, the question has never arisen, nor apparently needed to have been asked. My point is that most scientists donÂ’t really know what is or isnÂ’t scientific, because it rarely affects what they do.
Why make a big deal of this? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and, to know this, you need to know what science isÂ—and as we have seen, most scientists donÂ’t.
Neither Â“processÂ” is currently observable, testable or repeatable. Please note that when speaking of evolution, I am talking of the appearance of new (not rearranged) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information. I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals. When talking about evolution, I am not speaking of natural selection, which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species. Creationists, of course, have not the slightest problem with natural selection. After all, it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these. Anyway, the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle.","http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...sd/grocott.asp
So who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.

 Ok, getting off my soapbox now, I'd say you're totally right. Certain branches of Christianity, like Catholisism, have traditionally been very resistant to change. Unwilling to adapt, one might say. And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late. The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists, and so it isn't doing as well. We also see lots of little churches springing up, filling religious enviromental niches, as it were. 
 
 What can we predict for the future? Here's my guess. The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas. As communication and travel become easier, people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures, and religions will be forced to deal with people saying ""Yeah, but what about this new idea I just heard? How does that fit in?"" On the other hand, as people get exposed to other ideas, they'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to. Sort of a psychological anchor. 
 
 I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away, as people become exposed to more, different ideas. If you can't adapt, you become extinct. Churches that espouse firm moral ideas based on humanisitic reasoning will probably do well.",2

I hope the situation is improving there; guess we'll find out in 50 years.

 This is the first definitioin, let me know if you disagree and you think one of the lower definitions is the correct one, but they don't seem to pertain to actual science in the classroom (packing a suitcase down to a science, etc.)
 
 Science is not ""a murky combination of facts and theories"" in the classroom, but the evidence is taught along with the theories. It is taught that theories are not fact but that they basically mean that the conclusion reached with the evidence we have right now is that theory, since no one has falsified it, and all predictions made have been correct.","The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague. 
 
 The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths.",2

Clifford Burdick has a ""degree"" from a non-university (as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the ""University of Physical Sciences"", from which Burdick claimed his degree: ""'The University is not an educational institution, but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science.

 I presume that the rest of the ""scientists"" listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed.
 
 I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name ""Steve"" (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.
 
 I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.

"73952","Intrigued, as always I went to dig a little deeper into the methods used. Generally speaking, one of the best dating methods for an amphibolite metamorphic rock would be to separate out amphiboles for Ar-Ar dating. Using the argon-argon variant of K-Ar allows many cross checks for excess argon or argon loss that are invisible to standard K-Ar dating. At the very least, a better approach would be to date the rocks using individual minerals. The worst possible method would be to measure the age on an inhomogeneous whole rock sample. In the footnotes, the methods are described as follows:
 
Whole rock' samples were analyzed in all cases-K-Ar at Activation Laboratories, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb at the PRISE Laboratory, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

 ....
 
 In short, this is a classic example of geochronology done poorly. Snelling either deliberately chose the worst rocks and the worst methods in order to guarantee strange results or was grossly incompetent. Well, ok maybe both. I also notice that the data are not given in the creation article. If someone has a more detailed description of the results, it'd be fun to look at the individual data points more carefully. Lastly, Snelling implicitly suggests that if geochronology is not correct every single time, then it can never be trusted.

 I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though, and while I don't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard, they are certainly of that nature.
 
 Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time. Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime. The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun. And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.
 
 This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth.

Miseta [10] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship between molecules, the intermediates of glucose degradation, as precursors of precursor amino acids, and the organisation of the genetic code. This observation is also analysed by Taylor and Coates [11] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway, the citric acid cycle, the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic code (Fig. 1) and, in particular, they point out that (i) all the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family tend to have codons with the same first base (Fig. 1) and (ii) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the beginning of the pathway head (Fig. 1)[11]. More recently, Davis [12,13] has provided evidence that tRNAs descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids, suggesting their importance in genetic code origin.","Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?

 Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.
 
 Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.
 
 Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.
 
 There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.
 
 Archaeopteryx  from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)
 
 S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.
 
 A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.
 
 Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.
 
 There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.
 
 Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.
 
 There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.

 Secondly be careful in the use of the term creationist- remember AiG are Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a whole- there are Christians who accept the analysis of science yet still see the universe as the creation of God (ie. Old Earth Creationists).
 
 This is significant as it is important to drive the point home that YEC does not speak on behalf of all Christians (as it likes to make out), but are a group on the fringe whose position is seen as ridiculous by Christian and non-Christian alike.

 ""Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.""
 
 After attempts by ""creation science"" to get religion taught as science failed in the courts, the text was altered. The published text reads:
 
 ""Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.""
 
 And yet you aren't troubled by the fact that these two non-synonymous ideas can both be explained merely by exchanging either ""creation"" or ""intelligent design"" and ""God"" or ""intelligent designer.""
 
 And, of course, there is the view of Judge Jones of the Dover, PA trial who stated in his decision, ""The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism"" and ""The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory."" 
 Oh, let's see. How about the fact that both ideas rely on some magical invisible being that brought everything about by some unspecified means. What is funny is that for public consumption ID claims that the identity of the designer is unknown (wink, wink).

(My grandmother passed away before I knew her. She drowned the unwanted kittens, according to family stories.) But I remember playing with the cats. And then my mother inherited cats from the same litters and she feeds them dry cat food and canned cat food. 
 
 The cats I grew up with in our home had litters, and so our present cat is about 8 or 9 generations along and is perfectly healthy.

 This will be my one and only post to this message board. It is my research you are falsely using to support your arguments. Please do not reference my work in this way in the future.
 
 Your interpretation of the plastic responses of tadpoles to chemicals produced by predators is false. Much research (not my own, look for research by Robert Denver) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey, or changing environments in general, activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color. It has nothing to do with the tadpoles ""desire"" to have a larger or redder tail, it is simply a physiological response. The tadpoles have not ""evolved"" during the course of their development, as you assert. An induced phenotype is not heritable, the ability to induce it is. The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults. Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles. They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype.

"5998","What is science?
The first place to start is with a definition of science. Many exist, but most of them come down to something like, Â“If something is scientific, it is observable and testable (i.e., able to be repeated).Â”
Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is. However, if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement. In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research, I canÂ’t ever recall anyone telling me what science is (and isnÂ’t!), showing me what it is, or providing me with an explanation of how it operates. If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me, I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is Â“scientific.Â” After a pause, most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than Â“It is what scientists do.Â”
As an undergraduate, I was taught to remember, not to think. Sure, I was given tools which I could use to think, but I wasnÂ’t actually taught to think. Then, as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field (as do all Ph.D. researchers), and so the breadth of a question like Â“What is the definition of scientific?Â” was absolutely irrelevant to me. Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists, the question has never arisen, nor apparently needed to have been asked. My point is that most scientists donÂ’t really know what is or isnÂ’t scientific, because it rarely affects what they do.
Why make a big deal of this? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and, to know this, you need to know what science isÂ—and as we have seen, most scientists donÂ’t.
Neither Â“processÂ” is currently observable, testable or repeatable. Please note that when speaking of evolution, I am talking of the appearance of new (not rearranged) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information. I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals. When talking about evolution, I am not speaking of natural selection, which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species. Creationists, of course, have not the slightest problem with natural selection. After all, it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these. Anyway, the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle.","http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...sd/grocott.asp
So who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.

"6893","Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.
 
 We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.","Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.",2

"2876","It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
 
 ""What we now know is that in the event of miscoding, the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein-in-progress, end of story,"" says Rachel Green, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""There's no second chance."" Previously, Green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.
 
 Because a protein's chemical ""shape"" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Working with bacterial ribosomes, Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its ""walk"" along the DNA's protein-encoding genetic messages.
 
 ""We thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next,"" Green says. ""But instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash,"" she adds.","So what is being monitored by the ribosome?

They will say there is a canine kind, to which dogs and wolves belong, and maybe one or two other obvious ones like felines, but that's the greatest commitment I've ever seen.","Actually, the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago. John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated ""kinds"" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 ""kinds"", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.
 
 You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a ""dog king"" and a ""cat kind"" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the ""kinds"" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it ""variation in kind.""
 
 It should also be noted that ""John Woodmorappe"" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department.

Thus, even though our physiology does not require such a structure, our embryonic condition reflects our evolutionary history."" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p500)","Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!
 
 Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.
 
 The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.
 
 PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"".

(My grandmother passed away before I knew her. She drowned the unwanted kittens, according to family stories.) But I remember playing with the cats. And then my mother inherited cats from the same litters and she feeds them dry cat food and canned cat food. 
 
 The cats I grew up with in our home had litters, and so our present cat is about 8 or 9 generations along and is perfectly healthy. All along they were house cats and never allowed outside to catch birds or mice, so far as my mother recallls.

"5130","I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.
 
 I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.
 
 A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.
 
 Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people.

"36372","""Six pairs of these aortic arches loop over the pharynx. In primitive fish, these arches persist and enable the gills to oxygenate the blood. In adult birds and mammals, in which lungs oxygenate the blood, such a system makes little sense - but all six pairs of aortic arches are formed in mammalian and avian embryos before the system eventually becomes simplified into a single aortic arch. Thus, even though our physiology does not require such a structure, our embryonic condition reflects our evolutionary history."" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p500)","Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!
 
 Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.
 
 The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.
 
 PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Of course this ""law"" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development.",2

"7395","Intrigued, as always I went to dig a little deeper into the methods used. Generally speaking, one of the best dating methods for an amphibolite metamorphic rock would be to separate out amphiboles for Ar-Ar dating. Using the argon-argon variant of K-Ar allows many cross checks for excess argon or argon loss that are invisible to standard K-Ar dating. At the very least, a better approach would be to date the rocks using individual minerals. The worst possible method would be to measure the age on an inhomogeneous whole rock sample. In the footnotes, the methods are described as follows:
 
Whole rock' samples were analyzed in all cases-K-Ar at Activation Laboratories, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb at the PRISE Laboratory, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

 In short, this is a classic example of geochronology done poorly. Snelling either deliberately chose the worst rocks and the worst methods in order to guarantee strange results or was grossly incompetent. Well, ok maybe both. I also notice that the data are not given in the creation article. If someone has a more detailed description of the results, it'd be fun to look at the individual data points more carefully. Lastly, Snelling implicitly suggests that if geochronology is not correct every single time, then it can never be trusted.

 We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis (for short hand, HH).

This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.

It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.
 
 From article 3
 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including:
 A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred.
 B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.
 
 Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.
 
 In article nr.4

 4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments.

There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.

John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated ""kinds"" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 ""kinds"", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.
 
 You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a ""dog king"" and a ""cat kind"" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the ""kinds"" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it ""variation in kind.""
 
 It should also be noted that ""John Woodmorappe"" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department.

These experiments also introduced the microbiological method of replica plating. Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work.
 In their experiment, Luria and Delbruck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes. After a period of growth, they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage (virus) containing agar. If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria, then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbruck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.
 Luria and Delbruck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes. Delbruck developed a sophisticated mathematical model based on this hypothesis that was entirely consistent with these results. The conclusion was that mutations in bacteria, like higher organisms, are random rather than directed.","And from here: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC1aRandom.shtml",2

 1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
 
 2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.
 
 3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)
 
 4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents.

While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.
 
 We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

The facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science. If scientists think that it does, then these scientists must think it's pretty weak science to begin with. I think this new culture of ridicule among scientists is probably doing as much to hurt what they think of as a cause, rather than helping it.","Well stated. Whatever the reason, the new culture of ridicule IS there. When you see the in person comments of Dawkins, Provine, Myers, you'll know where posters here get it from.

But, I'm not so sure how they stand on creationism. I'll bet a lot of them just go ahead and believe something close to genesis (not literal), but surely they don't totally discount evolution (at least the people I have met and have known).

"1661","I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does.

To SS, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs. The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement, anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him.","I think you are right.

"72951","If we look at a closed system, as materialists suppose our universe to be, and look strictly at the material, physical events occurring within it, and assume that it is receiving no further 'physical' inputs than were the 'initial conditions' of the 'Big Bang', then it becomes plausible to believe, as materialist/mechanists most adamantly insist, that every single change event that occurred, is occurring, or ever will occur, was predestined, immutable, and inevitable, no matter whether it was anomalous or was systematic, right down to the last typo I've made so far in this post. All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions'. In the case of 'the big bang' they've another word for that, too, --something that call a 'singularity'. One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all.
 
 Seen from that angle, everything that occurs in any 'system' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers' involved in the 'initial conditions', no matter how protracted that action may be. The 'initial conditions' of 'the break' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up, no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls. And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire. 
 And that is very much the view of the universe's internal systems as held by materialists today. The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot, i.e., ""assumed"" , 'taken for granted', initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events, until 'the table' is all used up, entropically. All 'systems', be they physical or biological, as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes.
 
 That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology. All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that cannot be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions', nor in terms of additional external physical inputs,and allopoietic controls, but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs. This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset, however. We hear new magic words from them intead. Words like, 'epiphenomena' and 'emergence'. More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. Aka, 'magick'. Materialism, and the darwinism it spawned, is an extremely superstitious mindset.","But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.
 
 To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.
 
 It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.",2
"10852","I would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point. Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, ""Full House."" On page 138, Gould states:
 
 1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
 
 2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.
 
 3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)
 
 4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change.","A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology).",2
"9823","I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution. I have been called ignorant. This damned well gives me the right to call someone mindless if I want to.

 http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/history/dinosaurs/datafiles/compsognathuspic.jpg 
 
 Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.
 
 Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.
 
 Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.
 
 There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.
 
 Archaeopteryx  from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)
 
 S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.
 
 A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.
 
 Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.
 
 There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.
 
 Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.
 
 There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.

 There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.
 
 Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.
 
 There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.

 This will be my one and only post to this message board. It is my research you are falsely using to support your arguments. Please do not reference my work in this way in the future.
 
 Your interpretation of the plastic responses of tadpoles to chemicals produced by predators is false. Much research (not my own, look for research by Robert Denver) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey, or changing environments in general, activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color. It has nothing to do with the tadpoles ""desire"" to have a larger or redder tail, it is simply a physiological response. The tadpoles have not ""evolved"" during the course of their development, as you assert. An induced phenotype is not heritable, the ability to induce it is. The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults. Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles. They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype.

"70932","Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?","Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.",2
"7295","If we look at a closed system, as materialists suppose our universe to be, and look strictly at the material, physical events occurring within it, and assume that it is receiving no further 'physical' inputs than were the 'initial conditions' of the 'Big Bang', then it becomes plausible to believe, as materialist/mechanists most adamantly insist, that every single change event that occurred, is occurring, or ever will occur, was predestined, immutable, and inevitable, no matter whether it was anomalous or was systematic, right down to the last typo I've made so far in this post. All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions'. In the case of 'the big bang' they've another word for that, too, --something that call a 'singularity'. One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all.
 
 Seen from that angle, everything that occurs in any 'system' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers' involved in the 'initial conditions', no matter how protracted that action may be. The 'initial conditions' of 'the break' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up, no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls. And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire. 
 And that is very much the view of the universe's internal systems as held by materialists today. The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot, i.e., ""assumed"" , 'taken for granted', initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events, until 'the table' is all used up, entropically. All 'systems', be they physical or biological, as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes.
 
 That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology. All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that cannot be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions', nor in terms of additional external physical inputs,and allopoietic controls, but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs. This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset, however. We hear new magic words from them intead. Words like, 'epiphenomena' and 'emergence'. More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. Aka, 'magick'. Materialism, and the darwinism it spawned, is an extremely superstitious mindset.","But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.
 
 To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.
 
 It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.",2

"7080","As we learn more about the functions of the genetic code, it becomes ever clearer that the degeneracy in the genetic code is not exploited in such a way as to optimize one function, but rather to optimize a combination of several different functions simultaneously.

While our understanding of the genetic code has increased substantially over the last decades, it seems that exciting discoveries are waiting to be made.","Indeed.
 
 
 
 The genetic code sure is interesting. Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code, whether intentional agency, only RV+NS, self-organization or a combination of these, the fact that these processes converged on a single, reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system.

"28761","It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
 
 ""What we now know is that in the event of miscoding, the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein-in-progress, end of story,"" says Rachel Green, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""There's no second chance."" Previously, Green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.
 
 Because a protein's chemical ""shape"" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Working with bacterial ribosomes, Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its ""walk"" along the DNA's protein-encoding genetic messages.
 
 ""We thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next,"" Green says. ""But instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash,"" she adds.","So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.",2
