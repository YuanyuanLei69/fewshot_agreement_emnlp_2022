"8279","Conclusion
 Based on the above lines of reason, I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life: that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce.","The problem with this reasoning is that the criteria you're refering to aren't a definition for life, they're a set of guidelines, rules of thumb. They aren't meant to be applied to obviously living marcoscopic things like mules. Their purpose is to give biologists a common ground when discussing things on the microscopic scale. On that scale, where ""living"" isn't obvious, reproduction is one of the things biologists look for to decide if something should be called ""alive"".",0
"3904","The Bible only refers to ""high hills"", and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of, and after, the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest themselves of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers. This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank (as Psalm 104 suggests), the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the floodwaters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today's Earth surface. 
 
 As a result of this extensive erosion (caused by the retreating Flood waters) it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the Earth today, including places such as the Grand Canyon of the U.S.A. The present shape of Uluru, a sandstone monolith in central Australia, is the result of erosion, following the tilting and uplife, of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand. The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently. Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted, but we don't see this at Uluru, i.e. they are jagged and unsorted. Which indicates rapid transportation (like through a cataclystic Flood). If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of years, which is the story told in the geological display at the park centre, the feldspar would have weathered into clay. Likewise, if Uluru had sat in hte once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years, it would have weathered to clay. But besides the ""fact"" that it has reportedly been exposed to weathering for hundreds of millions of years, the feldspars are still very fresh, as though they were exposed only yesterday. 
 
 Similarly, the nearby Kata Tjuta are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders, sand and mud, indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly. 
 Receding floodwaters eroded the land, creating river valleys. This explains why rivers are often so much smaller than the valleys they flow in today - they did not carve the valleys. The water flow that carved out the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today. This is consistent with voluminous Flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the cose of Noah's Flood, and flowing into the rapidly sinking, newly prepared, deep ocean basins.

 How Organisms Evolve
 
 Evolution occurs on populations, not individuals. Individuals do not evolve, but are part of populations which do
 
 Evolution is a genetic change occuring in a population of organisms over many generations 
 
 Population Genetics - branch of biology that deals with the frequency, distribution and inheritance of alleles (genes) in a population
 
 A gene pool is the sum of all the genes occuring in a population
 
  The Mechanisms of Evolution
 
 There are five majore causes of evolutionary change within a population
 
 1. mutation
 2. migration
 3. small population
 4. nonrandom mating
 5. natural selectionGenetic Drift - small populations are more effected by random chance

"3624","Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from?","Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug, it cannot be the obstacle you presume :)
 
 It's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information'. For instance, imagine a lock with a three-digit code, like those on briefcases. It's easy to get in if you know the code, but it's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer. If you're right about the way information works, that oughtn't to be possible.
 
 The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it. That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser.
 
 Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down. That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection: the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive, and those who do not, perish. In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome. No information is being created, it is merely being moved around.",0

"7640","Archangel fails to understand the basis of Animism (as usual). 
 
 Animism seeks to explain things it cannot by assigning them supernatural associations. Often that is done through a soul. The principle argument I've argued in their similarities is that of why they do such a thing. What cannot be explained now or its relation to the greater whole is credited to a supernatural being, a being or set of beings that exists not entirely of the natural world. Where ancient animists believed that lightning was associated with the Gods, and that Volcanoes were the manifestation of Pele, the principle is the same. What cannot be explained or understood now is of a higher being. How did this rock get here? Where did deer come from? How do they exist in the larger picture? Animists assign souls, or anima to the inanimate and animate objects as a way to place what they do not understand into a coherent organized picture. 
 
 Intelligent design is no different. Only that it has replaced lightning, volcanoes and rain with the human eye and origin of the life. While it may not use the same identical concepts of anima to inanimate object, the core logic is identical. 
 
 What is too complex to understand or explain now is of a higher being.","Oh, I see now, you must pervert and completely redefine what animism is in order to apply it to your corruption of what christianity is according to the bible.

"5679","Actually, materialism does not have any answer for what 'drives' any organization, when you take the broad view. Meaning that their reliance on terms like 'law', 'force', 'energy' , etc., are only labels for unobserved non-corporeal, non-substantial, non-mateial, 'drivers', that are inferred from observations of certain repetitive, iterated 'change' phenomena/effects detected within this temporal, physical, substantial, corporeal universe. What these 'drivers' are, in and of themselves, is beyond materialism's power to explain, so it simply evades that fundamental question and starts with a universe, a reality, that 'just happened, that's all'. Ex nihilo. Ab nihilo.","But it does have an answer, as long as (and I see no reason to infer otherwise) 'organisation' is defined, as are many scientific concepts, as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena. Remember when we argued about entropy? I essentially stated (or admitted, if you want to see it that way) that the concepts that we label 'entropy', 'order', 'disorder' and even 'particle' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding. 
 
 Again referencing a point I have previously made, the maths that backs up the areas of physics (which necessarily includes chemistry/biology) that are confirmed with near-certitude, is equally as-certain-as-possible, but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language; hence the terms employed that, relative to the maths, are so vague and easily misinterpretable. My best example is the uncertainty principle, which can be explained in words, but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths. The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment; given certain parameters (already known) the UP is inevitable.
 
 The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation' and what may 'drive' it. This may be a personal thing, but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation' or 'drives', it should only look at facts and figures. After this analysis has been done mathematically, there may (and indeed always are) patterns discernible that we, humans, can label 'organisation' and 'drives', but these things do not exist in and of themselves. They are abstracts, simplifications, words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations.
 
 Given all this, when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces, we do actually know (ie we are almost certain) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures, not part of the world of human-imposed concepts. My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs cannot (yet) be further reduced to anything simpler. There are plenty of other 'forces' such as kinetic energy, potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs. The FFFs are anything but non-material, as they are intermediated by known, defined, observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity, the medium of spacetime. The only confusion comes when trying to determine ""What is a particle? What is spacetime?""

 Post away here if you wish but there is another post of the same title in the Religion thread that has a lot of discussion in it concerning what is probably the strongest discrepancy in the Bible.
 
 ""Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong""","Hey, bring it on. A month ago, I read over your 'failed prophecies' and if you are ready to listen, there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt.
 
 It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes, but the long and short of it is this: you don't even begin to know the God you are dealing with. 
 
 If you give me a space of time to get things together, I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you're his ""buddy"" then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses (Ps. 50)
 
 Here's a hint though about what happened in Egypt: God changed his mind. But you didn't know he could do that? You would be surprised how much like you he really is. He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible: Abraham tried to get Him to but couldn't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God was out to kill Moses' sons, but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind, also Moses succeeded in changing God's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites, God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented, God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins, I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them. 
 
 But be careful - when He is set on doing something, it gets done. Just when you think you have a ""pal"" in God, he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel: when a land sins against Me, though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it, they will deliver but their own souls.
 Even righteous Noah couldn't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world.

Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations. So while God is using him to punish Egypt, He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well. Get it? Is it too mature for you? Don't believe it? Too bad....it's true. God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations. When He is through using them, He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original ""servant"" so to speak. This is mature teaching. Most Christians don't like it. Too bad....it's true. You don't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day. One day, He will be finished with you as well. Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this (God is speaking): All these things you have done and I kept silent. You thought I was altogether like you, but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces. Ps 50:21

"8822","Â”Well, the first popular technique of creationists is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable. Henry Morris, in his 1974 book ""Scientific Creationism"" made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research? As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton Â– ""Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii"" published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the ""ages"" determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in ""air"" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this ""problem"" - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.Â” (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html)","So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.
Changing Decay Rates?
Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument.
First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?
Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.",0

"1980","How did a lizard evolve an avian lung?","Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.
 
 So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.
 
 However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.
 
 But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.

 One want an organism can change is due to being in a different environment, isolated from the previous group. Mutations can occur, and if they aren't killer, they are passed on. Changes in genetic material through mutation add to the gene pool and are passed on through mating.
 
 If you are an isolated group of animals, and you have enough mutations and mating, you will change over time. The environment, through one process, can choose who succeeds and who doesn't. It's natural selection. There are other mechanisms, of course, so that's not the only one.

 Public TV programs, educational policy statements, and science textbooks have asserted
 that Darwin's theory of evolution fully explains the complexity of living things. The
 public has been assured, most recently by spokespersons for PBS's Evolution series, that
 ""all known scientific evidence supports [Darwinian] evolution"" as does ""virtually every
 reputable scientist in the world.""
 
 The following scientists dispute the first claim and stand as living testimony in contradiction
 to the second. There is scientific dissent to Darwinism. It deserves to be heard.

"9990","15) Explain to me why we don't see humans or dogs or alligators with accidental wings forming. (If the possibility was there for random mutations to produce wings on reptiles or mammals in the past, then it should also be happening now.)","Oh dear; where do I even start?
 
 Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.
 
 The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time.
 
 It's tempting to think ""wings evolving from arms; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither; how could they have been 'fittest'?"" The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then' to 'now', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.
 
 So in a sense, 'flying squirrels' are your answer. I can't guarantee they'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years, but it's possible.",0

 However, have you heard of a disease called AIDS? Some people are resistant to that disease. Guess what? They are reproducing more than those who aren't resistant.",0
"6508","Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.

"3340","GEOCHEMISTRY: Dating Service
 Radiocarbon dating is the preeminent method for determining the age of carbonaceous materials younger than about 50,000 years. The determination of accurate calendar ages from radiocarbon ages requires a calibration curve, though, because the production of 14C and its distribution between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial carbon reservoirs both vary with time.
 
 Charged with the task of producing the official calibration curve for terrestrial radiocarbon dating, the IntCal working group has just released the latest version, IntCal04. Reimer et al. present this new curve, which replaces the previous version that has been in effect since 1998. IntCal04 extends the calibration backward by 2000 years, to 26,000 calendar years before the present (cal yr B.P., where the present is defined as 1950), increases the resolution of the period earlier than 11,400 cal yr B.P., and considers the uncertainty in both the calendar age and the 14C age in the calibration. Tree ring data contribute the bulk of the ages in the interval between today and 12,400 cal yr B.P., and marine data from corals and foraminifera provide the calibration for samples older than 12,400 years. Associated papers in the same issue describe the details of this impressive and valuable achievement. -- HJS

 The war against war metaphorsThe age-old practice may harm both science and scientists
 
 [Published 16th February 2007 03:05 PM GMT]
 
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Last month, when the University of Nottingham in the UK opened its new Centre for Healthcare Associated Infections, a facility dedicated to studying and controlling ""superbugs,"" The Guardian newspaper interviewed its director, Richard James, about why such a research center was necessary. He said: 
 
 ""This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons. And each time we develop something new, [bacteria] develop a defense for it."" 
 
 The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new. As early as 1934, the British Medical Journal wrote about the ""War Against Cancer,"" a phrase we still often hear. But today, militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain: conservation biology (""invasive species,"" ""biosecurity""); global warming (""global war on global warming""); and biomedicine (""killer cells,"" ""hitting multiple targets""). The attraction to such language is understandable, as it draws attention, and perhaps even funding (who can forget US President Richard Nixon's declaration to ""conquer"" cancer in his 1971 state of the union address, since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research?). Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language. 
 
 For instance, scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility, warned Erik von Elm, an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors. ""One of the features of science should be to be objective,"" but war metaphors are precisely the opposite, he noted. ""These terms have an intention, they are sort of modern propaganda."" Indeed, when Nottingham's James referred publicly to the coming ""post-antibiotic apocalypse,"" the UK's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering. 
 
 Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it, noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff. ""This is not language, this is the way people think."" In microbiology, for instance, scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy, and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives, said Brigitte Nerlich, professor of science, language and society at the University of Nottingham. With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), however, ""You have to look at multiple factors, and not just in terms of attack and defend,"" she said. Indeed, some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has, by introducing new selection pressures, only made pathogens stronger, while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions. 
 
 Brendon Larson, assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, argued the same of ""invasion biology,"" where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed. But in some cases, a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example, removal of the ""invading"" Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird, which used the plants as nesting habitats. ""We're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation, that [invasive species are] enemies, they're bad and we have to get rid of them,"" Larson told The Scientist. Indeed, according to Larson, the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security. 
 
 Still, scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon, said Columbia University's Barron Lerner, author of The Breast Cancer Wars: Hope, Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America. ""They're here to stay,"" Lerner said, admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors, he unknowingly began using them himself. Remembering, as writer Susan Sontag advised, that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading, and remaining aware of metaphors' effect on science, is the best scientists can do, Lerner noted.

"3149","ur definition of evolution is incorrect. if u go to any dictionary who would find that evolution by definition is a process of simple, basic things evolving or changing into complex structures in laymens term i guess[ex. society, religion, government and language]. what u seem to be defining is biological evolution.
 
 as for creationism...I havent decided how i should define it. is it religion, science, idea, theory, or bs. there r many defintions. creationism use so many kinds of definition that there is no point 2 define it...that and i have no idea. all the dictionary i've seen r different and bias
 
 I'm just trying to correct. sorry if i had offended u.
 
 btw colcletus next time u should be more specific, but i assume u meant biological evolution.
 
 oh yeah sorry if my definition sucks. i was in a hurry.","Well, you have proven yoruself to be a man with no brain, that is for sure.
 
 The definition that was given was the one that scientists use, not the layperson.",0
"2946","I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism.","Well, there certainly is here with these cats, because they're not actually inheriting a trait; the symptoms are being independently induced in all the cats, parents and offspring, by denying them all particular nutrients.",0
"4451","One of the greatest scientist of all time believed that a supreme being created life as we know it; that would be Albert Einstein.","And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.",0
"5530","ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue.","But you think SETI is worthwhile! :)",0
"2913","To say that an all knowing and loving God would prevent any suffering among the innocent is assuming that a lack of suffering is the best situation for us in God's view. 
 
 God can be all powerful and loving and still, innocents will suffer due to the poor choices of others.","Ok, this does seem like one of the weaker arguments as to why there is no evidence for god... but it's like this... Some people's idea of god is all loving, and all knowing... and well you know. But if that were the case we would expect there to not be things like pain and suffering. Granted, we may not actually be able to know his grand design, and how this pain is actually necessary... but it just goes against my reasoning. I guess I could take their word for it that it's part of God's plan... but since they don't know his plan either that isn't very comforting... and hardly positive evidence. 
 
 It also gets me wondering how they don't know how god's design work, however they do know god has certain qualities. (but that's neither here nor there)",0
"7345","There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse, yet creation begins with an irrational premise, that we can ""know"" about the ""unknowable"". It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).","Actually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961):
 
 'The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'
 
 C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):
 
 'If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidents-the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts-i.e. of Materialism and Astronomy-are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.'
 
 Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?",0
"42","However macroevolution is quite diffrent.","No. It's not. Speciation has been observed. After two lines of organisms are separated for millions of years, they are no longer able to interbreed. Oh, I forgot. You think the earth is only a few thousand years old because your mythology that you believe by faith tells you that.",0
"4498","Or you can leave them both in the scientific theory category, which is what they are - theories, based off of assumptions and extrapolations - neither of which are void of error.","But creation isn't a theory and it's definitely not science. And science isn't based on assumptions and extrapolations. Perhaps you should take a science course. Science is based on observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing.",0
"885","What great faith you evilutionists have in nothingness! LOL","Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called ""Ex Nihilo"" (changed to ""Creation"" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)",0
"7802","And with just one falsification, it raises eyebrows about everything.","So no eyebrows are raised?",0
"3385","Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.","Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.",0
"6457","This would also explain why gradualism is not found in the fossil record.","Uh, how?",0
"3551","Instead of debating the facts, evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence (or lack of it) in their opponent.","No need.",0
"9626","You've never seen a skyscraper or a Ford F-150? You must not get out much. ;)
 
 Everything on earth is found in nature, because nature encompasses everything on earth.
 
 Consider that some being with intelligence that far surpasses ours witnesses life on earth. Consider that they may say, ""Look, how cute! These particular animals manipulate their environment more than any of the other animals."" We are still a part of nature.","You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam, the bird and the bird's nest or the man and the man's truck.

"4094","This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording.

It is not proven.

"5655","2) Just because something has changed from one age to the next, this does not necessarily mean that one begat the other.","Well, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).
 
 And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?",0

Like chemist and all other darwinists, you imply wherever possible. But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist, and was not speaking of you at all.
And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--
"" Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.""
That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.
He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.",0

The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.
 
 Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design). 
 
 The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say ""it is truth,"" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can.

 As far as why most scientist agree I find has more to do with their worldview in many cases that their vocational skills. Why did most scientist agree with Piltdown Man or Nebraska man? It proves nothing in most cases. In the case of gravity it seems to make sense as most items heavier than air tend to fall to earth. Dinos to birds is a worldview not a scientific opinion. IT did it.
 As far as the Bible you should read it sometime. It is full of things we did not know until very recently like ocean currents , what caused the wind , to wash after touching dead bodies and many , many more. [/QUOTE
 
 Here you're just flagrantly wrong. For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds, as an example, please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic. And before we address the Big Bang, I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution. As for proof of it, we have the expanding universe around us, and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere. Could there be other explanations? Possibly. But the Big Bang is still the best we've got.
 
 
flagrantly wrong? That is a new one. Give me one , just one , peer reviewed paper proving any link between birds and dinosaurs. It is a religious/political belief and a fairly recent one at that. 
 The big bang is just as much a part of evolution as geology or palentology etc. Everytime one branch of ""science"" comes up with a new date for the earth and the cosmos all the other branches must agree or evolution dies. IT must be preserved.
 The best according to who? Who is we? The same people who used to believe that natural selection alone explained the origin of the species or that granted 200 Doctorates written on Piltdown Man? It is the same argument you said was fallacious -most scientist agree.

 
 
 
 Well, if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct (and don't quote me on this), then some of those things are actually possible. However, as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you, just because something is possible doesn't mean it's definite. I don't see any proof of those things happening any time soon, either, but they're fun to think about, aren't they?
 
 
It is an interesting concept, I think much is learned by looking for answers even in the wrong place. To quote it as gospel which many evolutionist do is absurd.

"6963","Fully knowing that chance in itself is not agency - there is no causality in chance, chance is a byproduct of an event therefore cannot effect anything, so the equation would look something like: chance + any amount of time = nothing, therefore evolution or any of its pseudo-intellectual ilk are simply impossible.","...and I wasn't disappointed :)
 
 I don't know what 'chance as causality' is supposed to mean, but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance' is highly misleading.
 
 If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it. We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0.
 
 Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.
 
 Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely, for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis? The chances just got even smaller! See? It's a silly way to think about it, because in the end it's the chance of the event occurring that matters, not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur.",0

I believe God gave us evidence in the form of His word - The Bible - and I believe He gave us evidence of His eternal greatness through his miraculous Creation. It's all here for everyone to see. There are no excuses.
 
 But I submit that the Liberals in this country have one supreme goal -- trashing this evidence - on both fronts. The first thing they've done is trashed the Bible. They've taken it out of our schools, out of the public arena, off the airwaves, out of courthouses, out of the military, and generally out of sight anywhere besides inside churches and homes. Instead of reading/analyzing the Bible and celebrating life, liberals would just assume everyone analyze porn and worship death.","As to your first point, as far as I can tell, you looked at the world and said, ""Naw, there's no way this happened without God."" And not just any God, but Trinity father son holy spirit God. The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all. However, you didn't just look at the 'miraculous creation,' no you had a study guide. Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions.
 
 As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said:
 
 ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" 
 
 This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups. What would you define mandatory school prayer as?

If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.
 
 And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.

 2.) There was no ""sneaking"" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.
 
 3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.

Â“Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.	The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.Â”

Are you saying that you aren't up to it? If you want I'll start calling you names too. Isn't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma? As for thinking outside the box, I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does. To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen. In fact, you make a name in science by challenging established dogma. Just think about the famous scientists.

 Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed. They are reproductively isolated. They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species. So Herring gulls don't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west, which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull (which don't reproduce with Herring gulls) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population. They illustrate one way that species develop. There are other examples of ring species, the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau.
 
 So how about this? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world. Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know. Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears, the have distinctive differences in their DNA. It is closer to Polar bear DNA, even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears. But guess what. All these bears can interbreed, including Polar bears with Grizzly bears.

 I already explained that. An hypothesis is made that explains an observation. Then a prediction is made that can only be true if the hypothesis is true. Then an experiment is designed or a situation established that can test if the prediction is true.
 They could. I suppose it has been done. I know of one case where anole lizards were transplanted to islands where they didn't exist. Based on previous observation of the lizards in their environment, predictions were made about the physiological changes that should be observed. Those changes were observed.
 
 Darwin himself noted the changes induced in domestic animals by the intent of breeders. This is now known as artificial selection.
 Don't know. Have you tested your hypothesis?
 The debate isn't whether, but how much. Is most evolution gradual as Darwin finally decided? Or do populations tend to remain relatively constant as long as the environment remains constant (as noted by Darwin in his notebooks)? Good questions.
 
 You seem to think that science knows all the answers rather than being a process of looking for answers. There is debate because we are still gathering data about very complex processes. That's how science works. That's what the debate is about, sharing ideas with each other.","Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street?
 
 Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination? I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of ""Ken"" when we imagine that ""Barbie goes to the beach"" Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not.
 
 I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge called The Myths of Evolution. He says the following about gradualism: 
 
 ----------------------------------------
 Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48
 
 Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52
 
 Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53
 
 As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57
 
 We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57
 ------------------------------------
 
 I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?) 
 
 It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!
 
 For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.
 
 ""Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,"" she said

Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years.
 One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.
 
 Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.
 
 The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.
 
 Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.
 
 Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.
 
 Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.""
 
 They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.""(30)
 
 Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species.
 
 Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land.
 
 This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: ""Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.""(31)
 
 It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil Record
 
 Here's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer.
 
 Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story. The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY'S THIS:
 I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth.
 So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist, even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth, but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence, was a complete myth. Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution.",0

It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula.

 The reason I post this is not to proclaim that evolution is dead or anything like that. I'm not so naive to think atheists would admit to that. It's to show you people that what you are putting your faith in is sinking sand.
 
 The theory of neo-darwinism that dominated science, and was proclaimed to be ""FACT"" for the past 50 years is dead. Indeed, science is in a state of transition...ie...they have no idea what they believe. Well, some may think they know what they believe, but the problem is, the evidence goes against all the garbage that's printed in school books that our kids read. It goes against everything that is being taught in universities. Thus, these scientists are afraid to make any sudden movements in fear of retaliation.
 
 So we're stuck. Neo-darwinism is dead, yet everybody's too dang chicken to say it. Well, most are........then there's this guy who's linked above who had a discussion at Uncommon Descent a while back. (by the way, he is in no way an ID guy...he is a hard-core evolutionist -- yet he admits that the modern synthesis is indeed a fairytale.)
 
 
 After the initial statement, be sure and scroll down through the responses. Mr. MacNeil has more to say. By the way, he's the same guy that I've linked on here before talking about finches...he claims that the evolutionary synthesis is obsolete here as well.
 
 http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2006/06/random-mutation-and-natural-selection.html","So, if one person says that ""Neo-darwinism"" is dead, and many people say that it is quite well supported by the evidence and show said evidence, we are supposed to believe the one?

 ""subordinate
 adjective
 Below another in standing or importance: inferior, junior, lesser, low, lower2, minor, minor-league, petty, secondary, small, subaltern, under. Informal smalltime. See over/under.
 In a position of subordination: collateral, dependent, subject, subservient. See over/under, part/whole.""
 
 The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms, where genes are given primary importance, especially in evolutionary biology.
 
 The second sense, that of 'contingent' and 'dependent' is strictly a matter of objective classification and is often used in systems studies, and is not confined to human social systems at all. For instance, our moon and sun are subordinate to our sun. See--
 ""dependent also dependant

 Determined or to be determined by someone or something else: conditional, conditioned, contingent, relative, reliant, subject. See start/end.

 Nope.
 
 So I'll quote it here:
 The tension between the two hypotheses stems from the incorrect assumption that atmospheric gas concentrations in the past were the same as today. First, before the advent of abundant life the atmospheric oxygen concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than today. In the presence of oxygen methane breaks down to carbon dioxide, so in the absence of oxygen the methane concentration could be much larger than currently observed. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so the relative abundance of atmospheric methane throughout Earth's history must be considered when modeling the temperature.
 Further, the inorganic version of the carbon cycle can be expected to provide negative feedback towards an Earth with liquid water. Carbon dissolved in liquid water can form carbonic acids, which can then interact with calcium to produce calcium carbonate. If rainfall were to cease and the oceans froze over, then this part of the inorganic carbon cycle would shut down. Periodic explosions from volcanoes would then cause a net increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels with no liquid water to absorb these emitted gases. Eventually the concentrations would become large enough that the surface temperature would rise due to the greenhouse effect. When the surface temperature became large enough for the oceans to melt and rainfall to resume the other half of the inorganic carbon cycle would turn on and moderate the greenhouse gas concentrations.

Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.""

 University of California, Irvine, USA.
 
 It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater.

 I already explained that. An hypothesis is made that explains an observation. Then a prediction is made that can only be true if the hypothesis is true. Then an experiment is designed or a situation established that can test if the prediction is true.
 They could. I suppose it has been done. I know of one case where anole lizards were transplanted to islands where they didn't exist. Based on previous observation of the lizards in their environment, predictions were made about the physiological changes that should be observed. Those changes were observed.
 
 Darwin himself noted the changes induced in domestic animals by the intent of breeders. This is now known as artificial selection.
 Don't know. Have you tested your hypothesis?
 The debate isn't whether, but how much. Is most evolution gradual as Darwin finally decided? Or do populations tend to remain relatively constant as long as the environment remains constant (as noted by Darwin in his notebooks)? Good questions.
 
 You seem to think that science knows all the answers rather than being a process of looking for answers. There is debate because we are still gathering data about very complex processes.

 I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge. He says the following about gradualism: 
 
 ----------------------------------------
 Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48
 
 Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52
 
 Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53
 
 As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57
 
 We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57
 ------------------------------------
 
 I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?) 
 
 It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!
 
 For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.
 
 ""Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,"" she said

"4108","Creation: The belief that the universe (and of course everything in it) was created by some supernatural entity.
 
 To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something ""outside"" the knowable universe. Because this is irrational, the entire concept of creation is irrational to ""believe"" in.  You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief. 
 =================================================
 The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth:
 Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws, which can be rationally explained.
 
 There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse, yet creation begins with an irrational premise, that we can ""know"" about the ""unknowable"". It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).
 ================================================
 
 You cannot begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable. It is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution, unless you can somehow show that you aren't relying on the unknowable. I think many topcis in this forum are good debate topcis, philosophy, politics, health care, environment, entertainment, fun, etc. This topic, like a few other noteworthy topics, requires one side to abandon reason for faith, an irrational position, as premise. 
 
 Keep in mind two important points:
 1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. There is nothing knowable that is beyond the reach of reason, this is why for someone to claim faith is somehow possible WITH reason, one has to try and show that reason is somehow insufficient for the acquisition of knowledge, which it isn't. (see other thread http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3329)
 
 2. You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason. Reason requires evidence, faith does not, they cannot be intermixed. This is OK if you choose this path, we can have opinions about it being ""good"" or ""bad"", but it does not imply either, there is no inherent negative connotation to being ""irrational"".

"5630","Here is a list of Christian Clergy that is fighting the Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism and quite plainly accepting the fact that the theory of evolution has massive amounts of evidence for it.
 Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.
 
 We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.

 Big Bang: Evolutionists are not concerned with the BB, per sae. Cosmologists on the other hand are. In very simple terms we have a factual observation: the universe is expanding with time. If we say, what does this mean for the past of th universe it can be postulated that the universe then becomes very small and hot if we go far back enough in time.
 
 We then find that the laws that describe the behaviour of the physical universe start to break down; gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. The pursuit of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) and Theory of Everything is concerned with combining the laws that describe some or all of these forces to see if we can understand how the universe behaved very shortly after it began to expand.

Which also fits beautifully with the creation account.","Except that your picture is balderdash. I presume that you mean beetle, since a Beatle is one of the fab four. The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings. You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism. Let me explain. When disected, the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers (which are themselves modified wings in beetles). It seems that time, in an evolutionary sense, has not been sufficent to make your ""wingless"" beetles wingless. Since the wing covers are fused, the underlying wings are useless. In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario. Wingless (or fused wing cover) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos. But the winds in my yard are rarely more than can be handled by any insect (only once in over 20 years - huricane Alicia). And when that is the case, they go to ground and hang on.
 
 By the way, mutations don't happen by natural selection. The very statement is utter nonsese. You are demonstrating your ignorance of biological science. Mutations (of various types) are changes in the genetic makeup of an individual. If those changes are in gonads that produce gametes, then they may be passed on to offspring. Mutations are one source of genetic variability in a population. It is that variability that is acted upon by other evolutionary mechanisms to change a population over time.
 
 Both mutation and natural selection are mechanisms of evolution. Mutation increases genetic variability, while natural selection tends to reduce it. There are other mechanisms (sexual selection (-), gene flow (+), recombination (+), genetic drift (-)). The very statement, ""mutation by natural selection"" shows ignorance of the subject.

There's really no excuse; it's available for free through the website of the journal Science, and the second sentence of the materials & methods section explains that Schweitzer did not stick in her thumb, pull out some Tyrannosaurus soft tissue, and say ""Gee what a good girl am I"" (and yes, I am aware that Schweitzer began this study under the guidance of paleontologist John ""Jack"" Horner). The opening of the supplement reads;
 
 Small (0.05-2 inches width) fragments of untreated compact and undescribed (1S) endosteally derived bone tissues were separated from Tyrannosaurus rex (MOR 1125) femur and collected under a hood, using aseptic methods. Tissues were demineralized (0.5M EDTA,pH 8.0) for 7 days, changing buffer daily. Material remaining after demineralization was rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 6.8) and imaged using a Zeiss dissecting scope with a digital camera and Axio Vision Software (other dinosaur specimens were demineralized according to this protocol but no further analyses were undertaken for this study).
 
 Rather than putting her hand in a pile of goo, Schweitzer separated the tissues and tried to remove as much mineral material as possible, leaving only the organic material behind. Indeed, this dinosaur (like many) was still in the process of fossilization when extracted from the ground, and there was significant enough mineral material around the tissues for Schweitzer to spend time dissolving them.","The reason carbon dating is not being used on the remains is that even the most advanced C14 dating methods can only - even in principle - report a date within the last 60,000 years or so. Try to date something older and you'll get a result, but it won't be right. Nor will it be pegged to the 60,000 year end of the scale, like a redlined engine; it could come back with anything.

"5727",".....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier.","Actually it isn't. No, really, it isn't; I'm not making this up; I think you've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there.
 
 Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. That's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer: frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures, whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment.
 
 Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback. Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier, which opens up some interesting possibilities.
 
 Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. The environment can only have an indirect 'say' in the genotype of organisms, by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others.
 
 That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better.

 the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23
 
 now bear in mind that all this happened in one day (day 6). How many species of animals can a man name in a day?
 
 OK, Noah is 9 generations after Adam, and according to the story, a generation was like 200 years on average, plus at the time Noah built the ark, he was some 200 something himself (cant remember the exact figure). so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day. Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.
 
 From the Creation to the Flood, the story makes sense. multiply the number of animals Adam named in a day by 2, and add 25% for speciation, and thats the number of animals that needed to be in the ark. sounds logical to me

 ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about ""evolution"" he's not talking about mere phenotypic change - he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that ""evolution"" has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered ""evolution."" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:","Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!
 
 As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth.

"2706","""They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable.""
 
 Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.
 
 Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.
 
 And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.
 
 So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.
 
 What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!","I believe you've missed the point.

 The noun evolution has 2 meanings:","Actually, there are three different definitions of biological evolution. Each of them is understood by biologists in its context without any need to elaborate. Each of these definitions are, of course, distinct and separate from other definitions of the word.
 
 For example, your definition #1 isn't one of those definitions. Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution, your first definitions isn't one of them. It is, in fact, more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today, and certainly not relevant to any biological definition. Your definition #1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories. It isn't what Darwin had in mind and it isn't what a biologist or anyone who understands biology means, even today. Either you don't know what you are talking about (most likely) or you are trying to raise a straw man (dishonest).

"9452","Didn't realise we were still on the idea of a total world-wide flood with the whole earth being totally flooded.","Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie. 
 
 Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
 Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
 
 You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:
 
 Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
 
 If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted. 
 
 Consider this excercise in logic:
 
 If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said ""let there be light, and there was light"" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?
 
 In the Bible, Jesus says ""I am the way, the Truth, and the light"". How can someone ""be"" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards.",0

The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection. The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways. One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group. Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point.
 
 None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect. Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects!
 
 There is of course no reason at al that one cannot have kinship selection as well as other motivators for altruistic behavior. So its rather premature to take kinship selection (which I think is what WW means by genetic altruisim) off the table just yet.

"1381","I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.
 
 Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.
 
 By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.","I think reason why the ""hypothesis validated"" card has been played here is because:
 
 1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.
 
 2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected ""transitional"" form.
 
 3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.
 
 Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.
 
 Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)

"4944","Let's not deal with assumptions, Monty, although I don't think that's the word you mean.
 
 Cite precisely where Dembski has published an application of his explanatory filter which has detected design in nature. Let's progress from you referring to a second hand report to the actual published paper.","Oh, WJA, what a neat little trick. The claim had been made by your side... that he hadn't published an attempt to apply his filter. And, that he was running scarred. Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter, or are you asking me if he's attempted to demonstrate his filter...? And now you want his publication in a particular form too! Another slight of hand.
 
 Despite this I countered that he has published.
 
 I said Dembski had come up with a filter
 
 The accusation was that he hadn't applied this to a biological system.
 
 Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible' application.
 
 Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you don't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim. You want me to come up with the goods.
 
 This is the neat trick. You've diverted things away from SLP's ludicrous and biased claim.
 
 The claim was made by SLP without any proof.
 
 The onus is on SLP to provide such proof. I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence'. The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied, and reject it as a failure.
 
 Nice try WJA. A small shift again of the argument.
 
 
 However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.
 
 ""In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled ""No Free Lunch"" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. ""
 http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm
 
 This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...
 
 So, go read the book  ""No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence"". Unless you think it's not 'published'.
 Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.
 
 
 As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote:
 ""Unfortunately, Dembski and his ""explanatory"" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in ""Mere Creation"", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?""
 
 The simple answer is 'yes he has'.
 
 This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side ""In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure.""

 As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time. How could they unless he had published?

"460","There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38","No, it's not. 
 
 The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since. 
 
 First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's ""hopeful monsters"" that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the ""only micromutations"" view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's. 
 
 Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a ""semi-macro"" mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record). 
 
 Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.",0
"4069","[url]The concept that mutations occur by chance is often questioned by non-evolutionists as being a requirement for strict randomness, but just what they mean by this is usually left unstated. In addition evolutioinsts do not in general specify what ""by chance"" or random actually means. Depending on ones world view there may in fact be no events which occur ""by chance"" as every event is viewed as causal. Accepting that (and its likely that events at the genetic level are indeed causal), the question is what ""form"" or randomness are evolutionists really talking about.
 
 WW claims that the very fact that mutaions are not strictly acausal (and in his not so well developed opinion are DIRECTED towards greater fitness by something other than selection - ie a vitalist hypothesis. Its useful to nail this question down tight.","Just a layperson of course. But I'll give it a stab.
 
 ... For besides the point that vitalism is an untestable hypothesis and thus useless in looking at these questions... 
 
 How does such reasoning prove anything of the sort. All you have is the fact that humans understand the reasons for some variations and not for others. Besides, a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best. That is WW's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God's will, He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good. Time and space are muddled. Seems to me that the observer using the more effective scientific method sticks (well) religiously to the present moment.
 
 Plus, ""acausal"" doesn't really mean ""no cause,"" does it? Just that we haven't determined one. It looks to me like the agnostic view. We don't know what's going on.
 
 Random also seems to mean that there are unknown variables or conditions present.
 
 Reminds me of discussion re abiogenesis and the term ""spontaneous."" I think us laypeople at least mistakenly look at causation in a very linear fashion. Rather than in terms of a set of conditions giving rise to other phenomenon.

"1433","#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species?","1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.
 2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.
 
 Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.
 
 Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.
 
 3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.
 
 4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.

"2440","He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.","I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.
 
 For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.
 
 Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct. 
 
 
 In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation. 
 
 Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change.",0

 Turbidites and Water Sorting
 
 There are some other interesting things to note about the geologic column. Many of its layers, wherever they are found in the world, are sorted with the courser material on the bottom and the finer material on the top of that individual layer (Except in the case of underwater slumps where the material is sorted fine to course). 2 Does this sorting make sense to have happened over millions of years? Sorting like this does not take place today except in specific circumstances. This kind of sorting only occurs naturally in water, and specifically in underwater mudslides called turbidites. I think it is interesting that much of the geologic column looks exactly like turbiditic layering.3 In fact, geologist today no longer accept the long prevailing hypothesis of uniformitarian deposition, but have opted instead for a more ""punctuated"" formation of much of the column. These punctuations are generally felt to be the result of sudden catastrophic events with long intervening periods of relative quietness. The does make some sense in the fact of the fact that turbidites create sedimentary layers almost instantly. However, turbidite flow does not flatten or significantly disrupt lower layers. Thus, any erosion or unevenness in lower layers will be preserved.

So no, I'm not mixed up.
 
 I am ""curious"" however, why you're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology? It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement ""evolution contains tautology"".
 
 Again, I think it's lack of clarity, possibly intential lack of clarity, in favor of casting doubt on the theory of evolution. Which of course, isn't being debated in science, on the whole.

 I will show you
 You could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. 
 
 A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.","Again, it's not the point.

"9559","From time to time our timekeepers must adjust their super accurate atomic clocks to synchronize them with the Earth's slowing rotation whose day/night cycles we base our lives on.","Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the ""super accurate atomic clocks"" are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.
 
 That's what is happening with the ""leap seconds"" that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.",0

"1196","what u seem to be defining is biological evolution.","So you knew that in the first place and yet you said that Demon38 was wrong. Perhaps you should pay closer attention to Demon38 and others so that you might learn something.
 
 The first day of evolutionary biology class I learned the definition of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. I know that you won't understand what that means, so I'll make it simpler for you. My Dictionary of Modern Biology defines evolution as the gradual process of genetic change that occurs in populations of organisms. I suspect that you are unable to recognize the difference between a definition of the minimum requirements of an evolutionary event, the event itself, and the theories that explain the mechanisms. All three are referred to as evolution. But in this case what was asked for was a definition of evolution.
 
 From the definitions given (by Demon38 and myself) it is clear that evolution is not only change, but a particular kind of change. It is a change in the heritable makeup of a population. In other words, individual organisms do not evolve. Further, evolution takes place from generation to generation. A single birth or death is not evolution. By the way, when I say ""frequency of alleles"" I mean the relative ratios of alternate forms of the same gene.",0

 Have you ever seen the planet Pluto? How about Saturn? Have you ever measured the sun with your own hands? Have you ever walked completely around the earth to show that it was a sphere (roughly)?

 Such is the case with evolution. Yes, the process of evolution has been observed and recorded by individuals. Just because YOU (general you) haven't witnessed it personally does not mean that you must accept it on faith alone.
