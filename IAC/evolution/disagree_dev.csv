The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.
 The evolution of the domestic dog 
 The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.
 
 In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

"6320","Here we have a case of an event where we definitely need some objective reporting. I suspect this was simply intended to be a PRIVATE SCREENING of a film. Private screening are extremely common in the film world. The whole idea of a private screening is that ... well, it's private. Meaning, only some people are allowed to the screening. If they were rejecting people at the door, it was obviously a private screening, so one has to wonder why these guys were trying to get in to begin with if they weren't invited. This doesn't sound like a case of anyone trying to bring science in to challenge something, but rather someone trying to crash a private screening of a film. So essentially, someone who's eager to play the hypocrisy card blogs about trying to sneak into a private screening of a film, but getting kicked out while his celebrity companion managed to get in. Big whoopin' deal.
 
 Since there doesn't seem to actually be any objective reporting done on this event, here's a different blog entry of the event that presents it in a different (and probably more realistic) light ...
 
 Did Richard Dawkins just crash the party at a screening of ""Expelled""?
 
 Some of the comments in the comments section there also shed light on the incident.","Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:
 
 1.) Dawkins didn't ""crash"" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.
 
 2.) There was no ""sneaking"" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.
 
 3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.

This is outlined in his book ""Starlight and Time"" and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory).

 There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents, such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark. It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said, ""Let the earth bring forth the living creature,""25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over.

 Further...from a Q&A Orthodox site
 Q
 A non-Christian person has pointed out what he believes to be a contradiction in the book of Genesis. First, God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones: Gen 6: 19-20 ""And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."" Then, God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow: Gen 7: 2-3 ""Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."" Noah though, took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here: Gen 7: 8-9 ""Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.""
 
 A
 Noah did not ignore God's commandment but followed it exactly. God's command to Noah was ""Two of every sort ?. , to keep them alive"" (Gen 6:19-20) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards. Then God gave Noah more specific instructions, to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds. The purpose of this became clear after the flood. The birds were needed to explore the earth (Gen 8:7-12) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord. Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says "" There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female""  If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females. If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice, these species would have become completely extinct.",-1,0

 http://www.kansasscience2005.com/Proposed%20Revision%20to%20Draft%202%20KS%20Sci%20Stds.pdf
 
 
 They are not talking about actually teaching creationism in the classroom, nor is there actually any discussion about not teaching evolution. What they want is to write into state guidelines requirements that kids have to be told that there are other theories out there, and there are holes in the theory of evolution.
 
 Personally, I see no problem with this, and it has more or less been our unofficial policy for years around here. There are holes in the theory of evolution, and there are segments of it that are mostly conjecture. It is in no way as foolish as the YEC theory, or even the strict creationist theory, but there are certianly hole in the theory. We may fill them in the future, but for now, we just have conjecture to fill those holes.
 
 All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school. Personally, I see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case. Just glanmcing over the proposed changes, I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect.
 
 The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue. On the one hand, you have the YEC/creationist crowd. Some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof Genisis. On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
 
 The evolutionist zealots are essentially pushig to remove any possible religous connotation from evolutionary teaching. The YEC folks want to remove any reference to science from the debate.
 
 Normal folks, people who are not just trying to **** on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom. This is not an unobtainable goal.
 
 In truth, we could put everything we absolutly know about evolution (have physical proof for) in a box, and it would be a small one. A large part of th theory is conjecture. Teach the kids what is conjecture and what is not. This just makes good sense. Teach it how it is, not how you wish it was. How many hundreds of years have we lost in scientific development because people failed to experiment into areas that were believed to be known? How long idd the theory of spontaneus generation hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically? 
 
 Nobody is suggesting that creationism be pushed in our classrooms. Nobody is even suggesitng that evolution NOT be taught. They are suggesting that evolution be taught acuratly. They want the kids to understand that the theory of evolution certainly has a wide body of evidence behind it, but it also has a substantial amount of conjecture tacked on. While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand, there may be other explanations, explanations we have not even thought of yet, that also fit the evidence. 
 
 One example is the section about the primordial soup theory. Do we actually have any evidence for the existance of ""primordial soup""? Have we found fossilized soup? Have we ever managed to create such a soup in a lab? Have we ever seen an example of life emerging from a sterile, lifeless environment? Is there really a difference between this and the theory of spontaneus generation? It is just as likely that an alien from uranus landed on premoridalearth, took a dump, and we are all decended from an intergallactic tapeworm. BUT, kansas BOA standards currently have people teaching the primordial soup theiry as if it was proven. It is not. It is baseless conjecture. In fact, it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules (life does NOT come from nonliving matter). 
 
 Persoanlly, I think both sides are wrong. I think that the evolutionists have fallen prey to the arrogance of the soft sciences. In striving to understand something, they have taken a relatively small body of evidence, made up a big story around it, and told themselves ""we know it all now"" rather than accepting that their explanation may not be entirely correct. the evolutionists ont he other hand (YECs anyway)....well, that one is a no brainer.

Which facts and theories are emphasized to students and which ones are not are determined by the worldviews of the teaching establishment. Scientific facts can be taught without the worldview of the teacher being a factor, but scientific theories cannot. Also, emphasizing one fact or theory over another will most likely reflect the worldview of the teacher, or the curriculum determined by the teaching establishment.

In Antarctica, penguins had plenty of feathers, enough to die when they progressed to the tropics. However, penguins also had variation in their feathers, so when a current brought them to the Galapagos, they quickly started to evolve.

If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for ""support"" and figuring out how to spin it, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
 
 Let's put it this way. Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry. One day your friend comes in and says, ""Dude! The prof's off his rocker! I have proof that he's lying to us!"" You ask Fred for some supporting evidence, and he disappears for a while.
 A while later, you see Fred again. ""Dude,"" he says, ""I told you. Check this out. Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction' to lengthen carbon chains. Wittig! It's all a ruse! He's been telling us about this, but that's not what actually happens! (And man, don't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization; that one's a real doozy!)"" You stare at him blankly, point him to the appropriate scientific papers, even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself, but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide.
 Finally, Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry. It turns out that sulfur can catenate, too, he says. This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds. In fact, Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education, training, and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into ""Grignardism.""
 Incredibly, Fred doesn't seem to notice that other students, the professor, graduate assistants, scientific articles, and common sense all contradict him. When presented with these problems, Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment, as science as a whole has only one purpose: promoting Grignardism.
 Fred repeats this every week, with the same argument every time, dressed up just a little bit different. Every week, dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in, inundating little Fred with questions he can't answer and observations he can't explain. When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence, he disappears again... Only to start anew the next week.

"8261","Lately, it's been tough for us atheists. From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life, the subsequent mathematical improbability of random, chance, godless processes producing and maintaining life, to people like Behe, Dembski, Spetner, and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media, the movie ""Expelled"" that showed a very real probability of how we've been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia. Well I have news for Christians/conservatives - they're the ones who are deluded! [insert stream of vulgar name calling here] Because God does not exist - random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity! How do I know this? From Madelyn Murray O'Hair! She said so, she proved how smart she was when she won her ""separation of church and state"" lawsuit in 1963! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science, that they've managed to take over the scientific community! How could they be wrong? How could their current representatives, Dawkins and Harris, be wrong? They obviously know all things! 
 
 Now, who should we believe, the Bible, written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write, no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it, or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community? It doesn't matter what the Bible says, Tiktaalik Roseaea is real! A small band of atheist explorers said so! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us! No God would have made the universe, and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it! Heh heh, is science unbelievable or what? Now, if you think we don't know how big those galaxies are, how many stars they contain, how many planets they contain that have life on them, how long it takes their light to get here (accurate to only a few hundred light years, plus or minus), you must be deluded or something! Just ask us, we'll tell you! 
 
 According to Christians, orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random, purposeless origins and existence of reality. That's ridiculous - all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist, though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance can't fully explain evolution, let alone the origins of life. Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away, never to be seen again! How could he be wrong - he knows all things! 
 
 It's amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise 
 concerning finances, morality, behavior, as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things, and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics,and liberalism [Obama/Ried] visual here] and be so wrong about the age of the earth, or how long it takes light to reach us! I'm sure we'll find out life originated from lifeless matter someday, it's been just around the corner for 150 years now. Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically, we're going to find it really soon! 
 
 Look, I'm an atheist, and us atheists, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics (the origin of life by natural processes) are the truth. We know there is no God, we will never question that, because we are 100% certain that Madelyn Murray O'Hair was right! Christians aren't certain about anything - they don't know how God originated, or where he is! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do! Clearly, stuff like morals and finances, and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century, we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris - soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases, make us all live forever, and count more galaxies for us! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science, and people like Dawkins, Harris, and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives, they'll inform me that they're correct, and they'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them. Are Christians ever that logical? So Christians, who exactly is the deluded one here?","I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins.

 Nevertheless, we look into the Pottenger's cats claim.
 
 Here is a page called, ""Lesson of the Pottenger's Cats Experiment: cats are not humans."" Although it's a page aimed at explaining why this ""experiment"" is not applicable to humans, it exposes the other, erm, flaws in this experiment. The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone: many of these cats were being deprived of protein. This page confirms and elaborates. In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.
 
 The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.
 
 We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control. There's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism, or even counters evolutionary theory, even if he doesn't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition.","The reality is this is no different the following link: ie...the animals who were fed one diet passed on traits differently than those who were fed another diet. Traits, according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY. Get that, geniuses? RANDOMLY. This is not random. Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly....nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur, nervous systems, bones, allergies, and mental processes. Instead this was all dictated by the environment. Thus, despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population, it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection. This is a hole. A huge hole....it's environmental evolution...that is, animals simply changing with a changing environment. Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first, followed up by new traits. Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment, only to be then be selected.
 
 I win.
 
 And this is no different than the following:
 
 http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/
 
  Normally, the fur of agouti mice is yellow, brown, or a calico-like mixture of the two, depending on the number of attached methyl groups. But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers, despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene (i.e., with no nucleotide differences), mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur, whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and cancer.
 
 LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829)  The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring. 
 
 Checkmate, losers.
 
 Oh, and by the way, electro-loser.....it doesn't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not. (Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle)...the reality is, though, these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms.

 Evidence sufficient for proof does not exist but inferential evidence does exist anytime you observe biology.
 
 I made a point a while ago about semantics, it was countered as a point mattering to evolution by pointing out it was just semantics which I quite agree with.
 
 The point still stands that people can hardly speak about biology without using words like 'designed for' and 'because' implying purpose.
 
 You don't hear things like that about geology and chemistry for a reason, they are not complex functioning systems which fulfill a purpose.
 
 The surprising part would be if systems fulfill a purpose without being formed by purpose.","Darwin spent 20 years after his voyage on the Beagle piling on the evidence for his theory and developing it further before the first Origin publication. He took hundreds of samples of birds from different parts of the world as evidence. He was an avid insect collector - he used those to support his theory. He conducted experiments in his greenhouse. Fossils displayed at the London Natural History Museum were used as evidence for his theory. THAT is how one collects evidence for a theory, not by just inferring that animals and plants are here, so they must have had a designer. There has not been a single piece of evidence for ID that I am aware of - from what I've seen, supporters of ID merely attempt to debunk Darwin's theory - hardly evidence.
 
 ID advocates use the eye as evidence for something that's so complex that it couldn't have evolved. In fact, we have a very good idea of how the eye evolved, we can not only see it happen among fetus', but there are plenty of animals alive today that have inferior or primative eyes. Again, this is not evidence for ID, saying 'The eye is complicated, God must have done it"".

"3622","It is commonly claimed by secular scientists that creationism is a ""science stopper."" The contention is that to ascribe anything (e.g., the origin of living organisms) to the direct action of God is to cut off all scientific inquiry. This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious.
 
 A number of general points can be made. First, the argument is based on ignorance of all the different ways in which Christian faith can enter into science and of how fruitful these have been. After all, many of the great scientists of the past were committed Christians and many of those were consciously exploring the implications of their Christian faith for science. Second, whereas the direct action of God may cut off one type of explanation, others will remain and may even be enhanced. To say that God created the different kinds of animals and plants certainly cuts off explanation in terms of evolutionary continuity. However, it leaves wide-open scientific investigation of every other pattern of relationship (ecological, developmental, etc.) between these kinds. Scientists have been so indoctrinated in the belief that all patterns can only be explained historically in terms of the happenstances of Darwinian evolution that many wouldn't even know how to look for explanations in other terms. Third, there is abundant documentation of the fact that evolutionary naturalism has often stopped scientific research. To take just one example, the evolutionary assumption that certain organs or features are vestigial has often long delayed the (fruitful) research into their functions.
 
 More specifically, one can appeal to experience and this is where this essay becomes a personal testimony to the scientific fruitfulness of a commitment to creation.
 
 During my undergraduate days when my ""heretical"" views became known, my professor (Otto Lowenstein, Professor of Zoology) made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department! However, he did allow me to do research. From the pressure that was put on me, I can only assume that it was thought that I could be convinced of the error of my ways. If that was the intention, then it badly backfired. Many a visiting scholar was brought into my laboratory to convince me, from their area of expertise, that evolution was indisputably true. Of course, hardly knowing their field, I never had an answer at the time, but after they had gone I would look up the relevant research and carefully analyze it. I always found that the evolutionist case was much weaker than it had seemed and that alternative creationist interpretations were available which were just as or more convincing. My position was further strengthened by the results of my own research.","http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp
 
 When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he ""hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer"" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago?
