It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.","Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.",-2.66666666667,0

"2516","Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. 
 A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. 
 The life or condition of a person in a religious order. 
 A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. 
 A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.","When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type ""atheism"" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action. 
 
 I'm not using the term ""atheism"" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.
 
 3) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing, only reversed, was going on in the US 100 years ago.

 The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding. 
 
 If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.

 EPIGENETICS

 The paper: 
 
 M.D. Anway et al., ""Epigenetic transgenerational actions of endocrine disruptors and male fertility,"" Science, 308:1466-9, 2005. (Cited in 112 papers)
 
 
 The finding: 
 A group led by Michael Skinner from Washington State University briefly exposed pregnant female rats to endocrine disruptors and found sperm defects in the F1 generation of male rats, which were passed through the male germ line to the F4 generation. Offspring of treated rats also had DNA methylation differences. ""Potentially this transgenerational epigenetic mechanism could be how the environment is influencing disease,"" says Skinner.
 
 
 The significance: 
 The study provided clear evidence of multigenerational effects of environmental exposure, says Andrea Gore, from University of Texas, Austin, who has since collaborated with Skinner's group.
 
 
 The catch: 
 Doses used in the study were higher than those seen in the environment, the authors note. ""All bets are off when you extrapolate the findings"" to humans or other animals, says Randy Jirtle from Duke University. Skinner's group is now working to study the effects of dose on sperm viability.
 
 
 The progress: 
 Skinner and colleagues allowed male offspring of treated rats to age six months to a year and found that a number of other conditions, such as kidney disease and breast tumors, were passed across generations (Endocrinol, 147: 5515-23, 2006). Jirtle says it will be important to identify the precise methylation effects that give rise to the phenotypes, ""because epigenomes vary greatly [among] species.""

 I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it. The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says, ""It's the environment, stupid.""

"4011","You are using the logical fallacy of 'equivication'. While a scientific theory is an 'educated' guess in some respects, it is much more than that. A scientific 
 theory is a model to explain the observed facts, is testable, has been throughly tested, has explainatory powers, and has not been able to be falsified. That makes it much more than a mre 'educated guess'.","Actually you are incorrect. I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who don't actually under stand what is meant by ""testing a theory."" You can not successfully test a theory. Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory. When sceince refers to testing a theory it's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they don't know, but it never proves the theory. It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory, but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul. 
 
 As such the tests only provide additional information (or education) for the educational guess. Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two. 
 
 In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory. The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical. By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated. However such is not the case for science. 
 
 I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think it's ignorance not misrepresentation on your part.

Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since ""beneficial"" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, ""downward"" mutations thus far. 
 Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a ""Young Earth"" than an ""Old Earth."" Each discovery is a separate ""Limiting Factor"" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities.","You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies about

 The main purpose of a scientific theory is to establish a model that can explain phenomena observed in the natural world. An example is that we find chemical reactions always result in the same amount of mass as when you started. This, along with many other observations led to atomic theory. Now, let's say that some chemical reaction was performed and it seemed as though there was mass produced by the reaction. Initially, this would be seen as an anomaly or faulty experimentation. If other people observed the same results similar conditions, an alteration of atomic theory, or a new model that is completely different from atomic theory, would have to be produced.
 
 However, even if this hypothetical experiment was confirmed, you would not throw out atomic theory as wrong without another theory to replace it. Atomic theory is a very useful model, backed up by massive amounts of observations and provides excellent predictions for the result of reactions that haven't occurred. To replace that, a model that explains all those previous observations plus this new anomaly must be made. It is also helpful if this new model can make predictions on phenomena that haven't yet occurred. An example would be when the periodic table was first produced; it was able to give a reasonably accurate prediction of chemicals that had not yet been discovered.
 
 The question I'm posing for this thread is, what exactly the theory of creation that will replace evolution is. This theory would have to:
 
 1. Explain the fossil record as it stands either by showing that creation occurred multiple times or that all species existed at the same time.
 
 2. Explain genetic modification and propose how responsible it is for alteration in organisms
 
 3. Present a model of interaction that can make predictions about life forms in the way evolution currently does
 
 4. Present a new system of classification (the current Kingdom Phylum Class etc etc. is mostly an evolutionary system)
 
 5. Be experimentally verifiable. If there is no extensive evidence supporting the previous claims, they cannot form a stable theory.
 
 These are 5 criteria that need to be met to overturn evolution, though I'm sure some would argue my list is too short an far too general.

The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.

 The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism.

 You are telling a lie. Maybe you have been duped by creationists and don't know that you are. A committee of 27 scientists and science educators was hired to rewrite the science standards. There were several drafts that were all presented to the board. When the final draft was presented, it was rejected and replaced by a version that had been put together by a YEC (a geocentrist no less) from Missouri. The adopted standards did not increase the evolutionary curriculum. The standards very clearly touted YEC ideas, barely mentioned even macro-evolution, and removed all references to the age of the earth and the universe. I know that sounds stupid, but then I don't live in Kansas where school board members think that limiting mention of evolution to microevolution is smart.
 
 I read the proposed standards and the ones that were adopted. At the next election several creationists lost their seats, and the new school board threw out the ""new standards"" and adopted the version that had been written by the committee. Those standards probably actually did raise the levels of what was expected to be taught in Kansas schools from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best. You were aware that the Ford Foundation had funded a study of state science standards and Kansas had received an F. The creationist standards also received an F, and the standards written by the committee of scientists and educators received an A.
 
 You know, it almost would have been fun to be a biology teacher in Kansas when micro-evolution was OK and presentation of ""holes"" in the theory were required. I could have probably gone on for a week or two about the problems presented to the Biblical flood story from a biological standpoint. Noah's flood requires macro-evolution. Not only that, it requires macro-evolution at rates that make the heads of evolutionary biologists spin. Just think - about 6 different species of horse, unknown numbers of cattle species, 36 different species of cat, twenty some species of the wolf/dog ""kind"" and so forth.

 HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the ""lots more"". 
 
 Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)
 
 When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.
 
 As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.

If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion, ""God did it!"" without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions cannot be proven wrong. Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God, and that is what scientists study. There are lots of scientists, evolutionary biologists among them, who believe in a Creator God.
 
 Science is not a matter of proving something right. Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed. In science, the facts are the observations. The process of science is a process of testing those theories, again and again. The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong. The more a theory has been tested, the more secure it is, even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic. How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun? Is that a fact? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons?
 
 Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are ""proven"" they will grow up to be facts? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and ""God did it"" offers no predictions.
 
 However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.
 
 So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?

 I think that you have confused one of Darwin's theories with the modern biological theory of evolution. It seems that you aren't aware of the fact that Darwin was not the first scientist to state a theory of evolution. Darwin merely restated the simple idea that populations of animals are observed to change over time, an old idea that was accepted by many naturalists of the day. In fact, even Darwin's grandfather wrote about evolution. By the time Darwin sailed on the Beagle, evolution was an old idea and by the time Darwin published On the Origin of Species the idea was 28 years older. Darwin proposed a mechanism of evolution, which is why his idea gained such wide acceptance almost immediately. What Darwin's theory lacked was a mechanism of heredity by which novel characteristics were able to remain in a population and not be overwhelmed by majority of the population that lacked that characteristic. None of the theories of heredity of Darwin's day could account for the origin and increase of new characteristics in a population.

 Science is incapable of testing the supernatural. Period. By the very mechanism of science -- methodological naturalism -- no conclusions about the supernatural can be drawn.
 
 However, when claims of the supernatural overlap into the natural realm, then those claims can be tested. Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God.
 Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that ""a Noah's flood-causing God"" does not exist, then kudos. This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever.

 1 November 1999 
 
 OPEN LETTER TO: 
 
 Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary 
 PRaven@nas.org 
 Committee for Research and Exploration 
 National Geographic Society 
 Washington, DC 20036 
 
 Dear Peter, 
 
 I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society. 
 
 With the publication of ""Feathers for T. rex?"" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature. 
 
 Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas ""will later name"" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. 
 
 Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen ""accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,"" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters. 
 
 Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that ""the Czerkases now plan to return it to China."" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation. 
 
 There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband. 
 
 Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions. 
 
 Prior to the publication of the article ""Dinosaurs Take Wing"" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs. 
 
 Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that ""makes"" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that ""we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals"" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned. 
 
 More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that ""hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers"" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical. 
 
 The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction. 
 
 The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode. 
 
 Sincerely,

"6699","Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion.","There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;
 
 The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.
 
 Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. 
 
 So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.
 
 The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started.

 1.) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME. Have you never seen male lions fighting each other, or elk, hyenas, etc, etc? They fight, the stronger one wins, and the female selects the victor to be her mate, and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male.
 
 2.) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME. Nature moves in cycles. Regions experience dry periods, wet periods, cold periods, hot periods, etc. Therefore, viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season. At one point, for example, there may be more predators than prey. With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators, only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food, or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population, will survive and those that cannot will likely die.

I mean, they're galaxies. Right there, in a picture in front of you. I'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong :)
 
 Let's use the same kind of analogy you've employed. If I want to take a picture of a basketball, I can do that close up, right? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs, all spaced out, I have no option but to do so from further away. With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera, and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball, I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame.
 
 Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens, equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away. In order to see all those basketballs through that hole, they're going to have to be a bit further away. Almost nineteen miles in fact.
 
 Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets. It's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles: now I'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away. 1500 suns? 217,011,334,736 miles away. 1500 solar systems (just out to pluto, not including the comets)? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away, or 156LY. If we include the comets, that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles.
 
 But we aren't looking at basketballs, planets, or solar systems. We're looking at galaxies, giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY.

"938","There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;
 
 The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.
 
 Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. 
 
 So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.
 
 The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small.

"773","The theory of evolution is not in jeopardy unless we start burning books and outlawing its teaching.","I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth. 
 
 The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact. 
 
 If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes. 
 
 Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.
 
 Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature? 
 
 Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study.

If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified.

"1223","(5) Evolutionary kinship of all creatures would imply a continuous intergrading of all forms of life, but both present life and the records of past life show great gaps between all the different kinds of plants and animals.","Actually, there is no such implication. However, there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor. For one thing, we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life. We find that it is DNA. We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life. That turns out to be the case, except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life, the DNA code is identical across life. We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do. We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat, which are carnivores, which are mammals, which are tetrapods, which are vertebrates, which are chordates. We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals, and we do. We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth. We find whales with feet. We find reptiles that are very much like mammals, even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals. We even find mammals that lay eggs.",-2.4,0

 National Museum of Natural History

 Washington, D. C. 20560 
 
 1 November 1999 
 
 OPEN LETTER TO: 
 
 Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary 
 PRaven@nas.org 
 Committee for Research and Exploration 
 National Geographic Society 
 Washington, DC 20036 
 
 Dear Peter, 
 
 I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society. 
 
 With the publication of ""Feathers for T. rex?"" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature. 
 
 Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas ""will later name"" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. 
 
 Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen ""accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,"" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters. 
 
 Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that ""the Czerkases now plan to return it to China."" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation. 
 
 There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband. 
 
 Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions. 
 
 Prior to the publication of the article ""Dinosaurs Take Wing"" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs. 
 
 Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that ""makes"" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that ""we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals"" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned. 
 
 More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that ""hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers"" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical. 
 
 The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction. 
 
 The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.

"3535","This would imply that things such as 'love' are not 'true' because they can't be measured by science.","Are you sure? Love is an emotion. Do my cat and my dog love me? They certainly have emotions. Tell you what. Why don't you propose a method by which ""love"" can be quantified. That way there would be no question as to whether it was scientific or not.
 
 I think that it comes back to your constant insistance that science denies anything that is non-material just because science admits a lack of tools to study the topic. Put up or shut up. How can I measure the love for my wife and children and quantify it. Do I have a limited amount of love such that I love my wife less because I also love my children? Do I love one child more?

 By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. that

You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.

"3390","A key doctrine in my own faith is that Jesus was born of a virgin, even though it makes no scientific sense - there is the matter of Jesus's Y-chromosome to account for. But that is the point. Miracles, by definition, do not have to make scientific sense. They are specific acts of God, designed in most cases to get a message across. Their very rarity is what makes them remarkable.
 
 An atheist, of course, will argue that miracles are bogus and are stitched together from the needs and desires of human imagination. Maybe so. To a believer, miracles are more than ""violations of the laws of nature,"" as they were described by David Hume. They reflect a greater reality, a spiritual reality, and they occur in a context that makes religious, not scientific, sense. To the nonbeliever, there is no spiritual reality, and hence there are no miracles. To a person of faith, miracles display the greater purposes of God, giving them a meaning that transcends physical reality.
 
 If this is true, why shouldn't we allow that the creation of our species was a miracle? Or why not agree that the sudden explosion of life in the Cambrian era might have been a miracle? Both might have been. In 1900, we could easily have said that the sun's fire was a miracle. Unable to explain the biological basis of immunity, we could have chalked that up to God, too. And for good measure we could have told our students that the interior heat of the earth might be the work of the devil.
 
 We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena.","But wait a minute! Hasn't science found that it's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard, and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects? Why is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ, and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man, Adam? If God could handle the Y-chromosome, couldn't God also handle creating the first, fully formed man? He calls Adam ""fictional"" on page 5. It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution. If there was no Adam, there was no original sin, and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis, only monkeys. Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus, he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements. Then ALL the basics of Christianity, the nature of God and central New Testament teachings, including the way the sinner Adam (one man)and the Savior Jesus (one man) are linked together in Romans 5, 16-18, are trivialized just the way atheists love. No wonder they're so comfortable with theistic evolution!
 
 On the bottom of page 235, Miller's comment about ""just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too....."" speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he hasn't had patience to listen to too many. But patience doesn't seem to be a factor when it comes to his enthusiasm for Darwin's works. He finishes the book with ""What kind of God do I believe in? The answer is in these words. I believe in Darwin's God.""

It's another two-way street that evolutionists have chosen to completely abandon because of their head-in-the-sand version of science which validates their atheist agenda. 
 
 But see I have a theory as to why science must do this: It's because science has come to realization that all animals have brains and consciousness in varying forms. These, of course, are the anti-science because science cannot explain such a phenomenon. But the fact is each animal has it's own brain - and each brain comes pre-programmed with its own abilities according to how God designed it. Each animal has a different function and different abilities. God knew beforehand that environmental circumstances would be changing, thus he gave each organism the ability to change with it. This is simple common sense.","I'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is. I'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness. Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought.
