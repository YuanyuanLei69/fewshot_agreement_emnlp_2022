"2500","GEOLOGY:
 The Calibration of Ediacaran Time
 Alan J. Kaufman*
 
 More than a century ago, the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee. This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils. However, recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval, the Ediacaran Period, during which Earth's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans. This interval was recently ratified (1), underscoring advances in the absolute dating (2-6) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period.
 
 On page 95 of this issue, Condon et al. (7) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period. The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China. Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes. The first layer, with an age of about 635 million years, is at the base of the new interval, whereas the second, at about 550 million years, may constrain the age of an environmental disaster (8-10) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota (see the figure) that lend their name to the new Period.

 Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods. In contrast, the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock, which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age (11, 12). Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation.
 
 In the area studied by Condon et al., the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation, which represents most of the Ediacaran Period, to some 85 million years--a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock. This observation begs the question: How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China?
 
 In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points, one must consider two possibilities: Either the sediments accumulated continuously, albeit slowly (some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age), or there are breaks in time (hiatuses or unconformities) hidden within the poorly exposed layers. On the basis of limited physical data, Condon et al. suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges. The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly--reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth's surface--and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions, and deserve closer examination.
 
 Spectacular fossil animal embryos (13, 14) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an (some 375 km to the southwest of the authors' study area), where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity. In such nearshore environments, oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level, resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time. Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al., and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences.
 
 At the Yangtze Gorges, the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity. Condon et al. suggest that there is little time missing across the surface, thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago. However, correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story. At Weng'an, both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing, implying a substantial hiatus.
 
 Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China, where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities (15). In the western United States, the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section, more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation. These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may, in fact, hide a lot of time, thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect. This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al. provide, but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates, and therefore their connection to evolutionary events, are far from straightforward.
 
 According to Condon et al., the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide, but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity. If this is not the case, then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse. Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations. In particular, atmospheric oxygen--long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution--appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period, not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges (16).
 
 Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections, geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time. These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations. However, even with exact dates, the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history.

 the problem is, if evolution is indeed true, then the story in Genesis is false. and if Genesis is false, then the Bible is not entirely true. and if the Bible is not entirely true, there is reason to doubt that any other feats of God as stated in the Bible (including describing his law, and even inspiring man for that matter). and if we doubt that the Bible was God's inspired word to man, then its just a book with a bunch of stories.

 I think creation has finally met its match, and both are on a more-or-less even playing field. creationists assert that creation is a fact, evolutionists assert that evolution is a fact, and neither of the two can really dominate as far as evidence, so both are ""theories with holes"". accepting creation or evolution has come down to a matter of personal belief rather than based on solid truth, as far as I see","While that definition of sin is true, the Hebrew definition means missing the mark.

 In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.
 
 BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.

 Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...
 ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."" 
 ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""

 Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk
 ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""
 Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm
 
 One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...
 "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.
 The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages
 But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.
 So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? 
 If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""

 Which is a later paper by A.C. Braun regarding is 1950s work on crown gall and his finding of the so called tumor inducing principle. Something that Agrobacterium appeared to transfer to plant cells which resulted in tumor like growth and so forth. He got a lot of funding by calling it ""Plant Cancer"" back then. What it turned out to be was transfer of plasmid borne genes to the plant tissue. Brauns work is absolutely classic. He got to the essential conclusions long before most of the tools of molecular biology were available. Think and experiment, use logic, do more experiments. He like Mendel managed to abstract what he was observing without being able to get down to the level of actual mechanisms. 
 
 It turned out decades later that the plasmid in Agrobacterium forms a good basis for making genetically engineered plants. In the 1970s I had the pleasure of working with some of the people who uncovered the plasmid and watching the story emerge. Some of that story is told in the following by one of the Chiltons.

Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.

 Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other. Venastega, for example, is more primative in form that Acanthostega, and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence. However, it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega.

For this reason, I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous. Two plus two may be four because we've defined two and four that way, but that doesn't make the equation untrue. Likewise, that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often (due to whatever specifics) is true regardless of objection. Whatever works, works.

Darwin didn't like it and only began using it due to the encouragement of Wallace after it had become popular. It first appeared in ""On The Origin Of Species"" in the 4th edition, and it was never used without an explicit reference to natural selection.
 
 I never saw natural selection as being in the slightest tautological before. I too have found natural selection to be painfully obvious. I see what you are saying, but I don't actually see that as a tautology. Early on I learned that natural selection was differential reproductive success. Perhaps I had good teachers.

"6030","Challenged by Creationists, Museums Answer Back
 
 By CORNELIA DEAN
 Published: September 20, 2005
 
 ITHACA, N.Y. - Lenore Durkee, a retired biology professor, was volunteering as a docent at the Museum of the Earth here when she was confronted by a group of seven or eight people, creationists eager to challenge the museum exhibitions on evolution. 
 
 They peppered Dr. Durkee with questions about everything from techniques for dating fossils to the second law of thermodynamics, their queries coming so thick and fast that she found it hard to reply.
 
 After about 45 minutes, ""I told them I needed to take a break,"" she recalled. ""My mouth was dry.""
 
 That encounter and others like it provided the impetus for a training session here in August. Dr. Durkee and scores of other volunteers and staff members from the museum and elsewhere crowded into a meeting room to hear advice from the museum director, Warren D. Allmon, on ways to deal with visitors who reject settled precepts of science on religious grounds.
 
 Similar efforts are under way or planned around the country as science museums and other institutions struggle to contend with challenges to the theory of evolution that they say are growing common and sometimes aggressive.
 
 One company, called B.C. Tours ""because we are biblically correct,"" even offers escorted visits to the Denver Museum of Science and Nature. Participants hear creationists' explanations for the exhibitions.
 
 So officials like Judy Diamond, curator of public programs at the University of Nebraska State Museum in Lincoln, are trying to meet such challenges head-on.
 
 Dr. Diamond is working on evolution exhibitions financed by the National Science Foundation that will go on long-term display at six museums of natural history from Minnesota to Texas. The program includes training for docents and staff members.
 
 ""The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,"" she said. ""Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.""
 
 Dr. Allmon, who directs the Paleontological Research Institution, an affiliate of Cornell University, began the training session here in September with statistics from Gallup Polls: 54 percent of Americans do not believe that human beings evolved from earlier species, and although almost half believe that Darwin has been proved right, slightly more disagree.
 
 ""Just telling them they are wrong is not going to be effective,"" he said.
 
 Instead, he told the volunteers that when they encounter religious fundamentalists they should emphasize that science museums live by the rules of science. They seek answers in nature to questions about nature, they look for explanations that can be tested by experiment and observation in the material world, and they understand that all scientific knowledge is provisional - capable of being overturned when better answers are discovered.
 
 ""Is it against all religion?"" he asked. ""No. But it is against some religions.""
 
 There is more than one type of creationist, he said: ""thinking creationists who want to know answers, and they are willing to listen, even if they go away unconvinced"" and ""people who for whatever reason are here to bother you, to trap you, to bludgeon you.""
 
 Those were the type of people who confronted Dr. Durkee, a former biology professor at Grinnell College in Iowa. The encounter left her discouraged.
 
 ""It is no wonder that many biologists will simply refuse to debate creationists or I.D.ers,"" she said, using the abbreviation for intelligent design, a cousin of creationism. ""It is as if they aren't listening.""
 
 Dr. Allmon says even trained scientists like Dr. Durkee can benefit from explicit advice about dealing with religious challenges to science exhibitions.
 
 ""There is an art, a script that is very, very helpful,"" he said.
 
 A pamphlet handed out at the training session provides information on the scientific method, the theory of evolution and other basic information. It offers suggestions on replying to frequently raised challenges like ""Is there lots of evidence against evolution?"" (The answer begins, simply, ""No."")
 
 When talking to visitors about evolution, the pamphlet advises, ""don't avoid using the word."" Rehearse answers to frequently asked questions, because ""you'll be more comfortable when you sound like you know what you're talking about.""
 
 Dr. Allmon told his audience to ""be firm and clear, not defensive."" The pamphlet says that if all else fails, and docents find themselves in an unpleasant confrontation, they excuse themselves by saying, ""I have to go to the restroom.""
 
 Eugenie C. Scott, who directs the National Center for Science Education and is conducting training sessions for Dr. Diamond's program, said that within the last year or so efforts to train museum personnel and volunteers on evolution and related topics had substantially increased. ""This seems to be a cottage industry now,"" Dr. Scott said.
 
 Robert M. West, a paleontologist and former science museum director who is now a consultant to museums, said several institutions were intensifying the docents' training ""so they are comfortable with the concepts, not just the material but the intellectual, philosophical background - and they know their administrations are going to support them if someone criticizes them.""
 
 At the Denver science museum, the staff and docents often encounter groups from B.C. Tours, which for 15 years has offered tours of the museum based on literal readings of the Bible. The group embraces young-earth creationism, the view that the earth and its plants, animals and people were created in a matter of days a few thousand years ago.
 
 ""We present both sides from an objective perspective and let the students decide for themselves,"" said Rusty Carter, an operator of the group.
 
 Mr. Carter praised the museum, saying it had been ""very professional and accommodating, even though they do not support us."" A typical group might have 30 or 40 people, he added.
 
 Kirk Johnson, a paleontologist who is the chief curator at the museum, was philosophical about the group. ""It's interesting to walk along with them,"" he said.
 
 Participants pay the admission fee and have as much right as anyone else to be in the museum, Dr. Johnson said, but sometimes ""we have to restrain our docents from interacting with them.""
 
 John G. West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, whose researchers endorse intelligent design, said he was not aware of organized efforts to challenge museum exhibitions on evolution. He added, ""It is not unheard of for museum exhibits to be wrong scientifically.""
 
 Dr. Scott, who trained as a physical anthropologist, said that in training docents she emphasized ""how the public understands or misunderstands evolution and some of the misconceptions they come in with."" She hopes to combat the idea that people must choose between science and faith - ""that you are either a good Christian creationist or an evil atheist evolutionist.""
 
 ""It's your job,"" she told docents, ""not to slam the door in the face of a believer.""
 
 At the American Museum of Natural History, which is about to open what it describes as ""the most in-depth exhibition ever"" on Darwin and his work, curators and other staff members instruct volunteer ""explainers"" on the science behind its exhibitions, according to Stephen Reichl, a spokesman. If visitors challenge the presentations, the explainers are instructed to listen ""and then explain the science and the evidence.""
 
 Sarah Fiorello, an environmental educator at the Finger Lakes State Parks Region who took part in the Ithaca training session in August, said she was now prepared to take the same approach. When she describes the region's geological history on tours of its gorges, visitors often object - as even a member of her family once did - that ""it does not say that in the Bible.""
 
 Now, she said, she will tell them, ""The landscape tells a story based on geological events, based on science.""
 
 Dr. Durkee also said she found the session helpful. ""When you are in a museum, you can't antagonize people,"" she said. ""Your job is to help them, to explain your point of view, but respect theirs.
 
 ""I like the idea of stressing that this is a science museum, and we deal with matters of science.""","Kudos to them for stepping up to the plate.
 
 A part of me thinks it's sad that it has come to this, and will surely develop further, but part of me thinks this is just the sort of thing needed.
 
 Most creationists don't realize that they are creationists.
 Maybe more of them will start to prod and ask questions of people like museum curators, and perhaps some of them will leave with a broader science knowlege. 
 
 Actually, I might begin to believe that this upwelling of support for young earth creationism and intellegent design creationism might have its benefits.
 
 If more and more people come out of the woodwork and inadvertantly admit that they are scientifically illiterate by hitting people like museum curators and teachers with creationist arguments against evolution, then maybe more of them will debate the topic long enough to have an epiphone. They might just realize they had been blinded by faith, not in their god or holy book, but by what preacher Joe down the corner had told them.",-0.4,1

"3207","The purpose of this thread is to discuss recent findings on the optimality of the genetic code.
 Selected articles in the OP include the following:[*]Early Fixation of an Optimal Genetic Code [*]Evolution of the genetic code: partial optimization of a random code for robustness to translation error in a rugged fitness landscape[*]The genetic code is nearly optimal for allowing additional information within protein-coding sequences[*]An extension of the coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code[*]Can the genetic code be mathematically described?[*]On the Hypercube Structure of the Genetic Code[*]Topological structure of the triplet genetic code[*]A Neutral Origin for Error Minimization in the Genetic Code.[*]Does codon bias have an evolutionary origin?[*]A chemical toolkit for proteins &#8212; an expanded genetic code[*]Evolution and multilevel optimization of the genetic codeFeel free to add more interesting articles as the discussion continues.
 
 Article 1
 Thus, to begin, in the first article it was determined by the researchers that:
 
 No better codes out of a million biosynthetically restricted codes.
 This conclusion might be misleading though (addressed here), as the paper states that the tested codes were from a biosynthetically restricted set based on the current hypothesis of the evolution of the genetic code from pre-biotic scenarios. When not viewed from this point of view, other, more optimized codes are possible.
 
 The next article (nr 2) shows that:
 
 Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes (not only biosynthetically restricted codes) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization. It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.
 
 From article 3
 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including:
 A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred.
 B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.
 
 Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.
 
 In article nr.4 
 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed. The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic (biosynthetically restricted) relationships between amino acids.
 A few interesting observations can be made:
 Firstly, from the article:
 
 
 It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes (derived form the original). E.g. Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates. Archaea, however seem to be the most primitive organisms, thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on.
 Thus an interesting question can be applied to an ""evolving"" code as posited in the above quote:
 Are these ""still evolving"" mRNAs, still evolving? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum? 
 
 Secondly, from the article:
 
 
 Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?
 
 Articles 5-7
 These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code. For example, in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a six&#8211;dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed. 
 Abstract:
 
 
 
 Article 8:
 In this article it once again discusses the optimality of the code and a few fascinating conclusions were made. For example:
 
 
 Also form the article:
 
 
 
 Thus, an important point is raised:
 
 
 The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code.
 
 Article 9:
 In this article, the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed.
 From the article:
 
 
 Thus, the properties of the code allow it to maintain its own functional integrity.
 Also form the article:
 
 
 The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection, but dependent on internal variables (feedback system) for maintaining functional integrity. Again, showing another form of optimality.
 
 In article 10:
 Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated (engineered) into proteins yielding viable organisms.
 
 An intriguing question arises from this research. It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection (e.g. amino acids with photoaffinity) and then be incorporated into the standard code. Yet the code seems to remain stagnant. For billions of year after fixation, little evolution happened in the code. Why? 
 Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape, with a pre-existing fitness function?
 
 Finally, Article 11:
 The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes:
 
 Indeed.
 
 
 
 The genetic code sure is interesting. Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code, whether intentional agency, only RV+NS, self-organization or a combination of these, the fact that these processes converged on a single, reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system. The system seems to be rigged and biased towards certain outcomes similar to the evolution of life.","Again, as an ignorant layman, I can only get the gist of this material, but how anyone could possibly argue against the genetic code as a product of intelligent design is beyond me.",-0.666666666667,1
"7448","**
 Derived from the materialist Hobbesian view that 'life/nature' is, ""A war of all against all.""","Hobbes specifically said that this is not the case. Cooperation exists, and is essential. Without it, the life of man would be ""a war of all against all"", and would be ""solitary, nasty, brutish, and short."" But man is inherently, biologically social, at the level of the family and the tribe. Daniel Boone, moving further into the wilderness whenever he could see the smoke from someone else's cabin, or solitary hermits in the desert, are quite rare, and even they are dependent on the rest of society for sustenance. Solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments short of serious physical damage.
 
 Nor is a war of all against all true in evolution. Evolutionary theory includes the evolution of cooperation and altruism along with murder, hunting, and the like. For example, the cooperation of the cells in your body to form organs that support each other, and the mechanism of apoptosis by which most pre-cancerous cells and others that have suffered damage destroy themselves. Or the convergent evolution of numerous species of hive and nest insects (and naked mole rats) from solitary precursors. Or the cooperative evolution of eye and brain structures from light-sensitive cells, or bird's wings along with hollow bones, or symbiosis of all kinds, including intracellular organelles such as mitochondria. Coevolution of bees and flowers is another instance. Or crocodiles not eating the birds that clean their teeth.",-0.8,1

Are they that starved for emamples? :
 
 A huge number of small, sterile, sick, deformed, aberrant plants were produced. However, from all this effort, almost no meaningful crop improvement resulted. The effort was for the most part an enormous failure, and was almost entirely abandoned. Why? It was because even with all those billions of mutations, there were no significant new beneficial mutations arising. Sanford

"7786","Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. ""science"" and ""reality"".","Well, stated that way, there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing. Many evolutionary biologists are religious. Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist. He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents. There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world.
 
 The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general. You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological, several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planets, the earth, and life on earth. Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.
 
 So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.
 
 Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on ""divine revelation."" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions.

 The theory of directed variation
 
 It is a deep property of Darwinism that the direction of evolution, particularly of adaptive evolution, is uncoupled from the direction of variation. When a new recombinant or mutant genotype arises, there is no tendency for it to arise in the direction of improved adaptation. Natural selection imposes direction on evolution, using undirected variation. An alternative viewpoint is the theory of directed variation.

 As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on.
 
 In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality.","Ah, thanks for the correction, although there are really many ways to state the method.

 Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace. Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross.
 
 Also, you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity. That's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand. Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation.

 Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24
 It ""eats grass like an ox.""
 It ""moves his tail like a cedar."" (In Hebrew, this literally reads, ""he lets hang his tail like a cedar."")
 Its ""bones are like beams of bronze,
 His ribs like bars of iron.""
 ""He is the first of the ways of God.""
 ""He lies under the lotus trees,
 In a covert of reeds and marsh.""
 Job 40:15-24 (New International Version)
 
 15 ""Look at the behemoth, [a] 
 which I made along with you 
 and which feeds on grass like an ox.
 
 16 What strength he has in his loins, 
 what power in the muscles of his belly!
 
 17 His tail [b] sways like a cedar; 
 the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.
 
 18 His bones are tubes of bronze, 
 his limbs like rods of iron.
 
 19 He ranks first among the works of God, 
 yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.
 
 20 The hills bring him their produce, 
 and all the wild animals play nearby.
 
 21 Under the lotus plants he lies, 
 hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
 
 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; 
 the poplars by the stream surround him.
 
 23 When the river rages, he is not alarmed; 
 he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
 
 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes, [c] 
 or trap him and pierce his nose?
 Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing-just enough to make the point.
 ""No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.""
 ""Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?""
 ""His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.""
 ""His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.""
 ""Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.""
 ""On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.""
 Leviathan ""played"" in the ""great and wide sea"" (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26-get the exact sense by reading them yourself).
 Leviathan is a ""reptile [a] that is in the sea."" (Isaiah 27:1)
 [a] Note: The word translated ""reptile"" here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that ""Leviathan"" was also a ""tanniyn"" (dragon).
 Job 41:18-21 
 18
 By his exhaling a light does shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
 19
 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
 20
 Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
 21
 His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
 
 Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.
 
 How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence?

Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.

 I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests, but I don't believe in doing it in a forceable way. I don't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once, it takes a combination of many tiny little steps (examples) to win converts. 
 
 My main reason for posting here is political. I don't believe it's possible to have neutrality in government. If church & state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Atheism almost always equals secular ""progression"", and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition, according to unchanging Biblical morals. The two quickly clash in politics. Also, I don't believe future generations (school children) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough.

"3639","Not so. Systems are extended, temporally. They are a series of connected, interdependent events, and not a singlular event, by definition. Therefore there is no saying that what determines them is a single set of 'initial conditions', since even the simplest allopatric systems [such as the solar system], are constantly and perpetually receiving fresh input on top of whatever their 'initial conditions' may have been. Initial conditions start systems going, but they continue on thanks to constant input; otherwise entropy puts a stop to them. Therefore it is false to believe that "" if you could trace the evolution of [any] system back in time with perfect accuracy, [then what it is now] would all be originally determined by the system's initial state."".","But of course! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state. 
 
 (No system can ever be truly closed, truly isolated from the rest of the universe, for what should be obvious reasons. Certain systems are only classified as 'closed' for experiments' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results, thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide.) In your pool-shot example below, for instance, the initial state must take account of the wear & tear of the table, the strength of the cue, the slope of the floor, humidity, temperature and every other variable.
 
 So any such 'backtracking' (which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated.

A neutral, agnostic worldview may think they are somewhat comparable. The Judeo Christian worldview that is taught to many students by their parents would think that evolution (happenstance origins) isn't in any way close to ID. So we have two one sided worldviews, and one neutral one. Since a free exploration of ideas would give students the most complete picture, would interfere less with altering their worldviews that were most likely formed in the home, and would be most likely to teach them HOW to think, why are we dangerously close (thanks John Jones) to allowing one - one sided worldview to completely suppress another worldview in the science classroom? The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger. The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies, that entitle us all, particularly organizations, to a share of federal pie. Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices, the microscopes and telescopes. 
 
 In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion. This is one of many government agencies that science ""serves"", and others have fat budgets as well. Leaf through Science magazine and you'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it's biggest preoccupations. To maintain it, science peddles hope and fear. Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific ""theories"" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.

Evolution is basically the change in allelle frequency over time. It helps explain how life adapts, changes and how we and modern animals came to be, not how life orignally started. That's another topic and theory. 
 
 Life probably started through abiogenesis, which God conflicts with more. Life probably started with one molecule and went on, forming more complex organisms due to certain conditions and stimuli.","Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup. 
 
 Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. ""You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth"" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.

One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional.

 That's the Lesser black-backed gull (L. fuscus). Even though it shares the same range as the herring gull it does not interbreed with herring gulls. So here is one large population that has become two different species at the extremes of its range, and those extremes overlap.

 If you believe that a planet populated solely by atheists would remain solely atheist (without the influence of God), on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth? Especially those that were around before Christianity, and cannot therefore be accused of copying a successful format?","A good question, and it's a good thing I'm not a politician (or even a talk radio host:p) or then I would have to do some dancing. I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as ""one of the world's great religions"" - I guess a U.S. President would have to do that, as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation. A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way - it's a false religion. 
 
 Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion, as well as atheism. Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard - they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith, and separate themselves from them. But since the term ""religion"" is so broad and vague, it's easy to see that atheists can't really do that so well, because there are a few religions that they can't have much disagreement with - ""Pantheism"", ""scientism"", would certainly be two, and there are probably more. Any religion that worships nature, with no defined god, isn't really at odds with atheism, is it?
 
 Your phrase within parenthesis, ""without the influence of God"", points out (to me) that discussions about God on these forums, and even throughout Christian study and discussion, are all too often about only his presence or absence, nothing more. There is something more, and that something is Satan, the ""great deceiver"", the ""evil one"". In Databed's hypothetical, where he said ""stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ"", my belief is that God/Christ would be there, (omnipresent) but I wasn't really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there. I believe it's Satan's presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up. 
 
 So to clarify my answer to his question, for people on another planet ""with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ"" would become a blend of atheism and false religion, since Satan is the author of both.

I lead a good life and if that isn't good enough than phooey. That wouldn't be a God I'd want to worship anyway. You understand of course that I don't except the mere existence of a book as God making his desires clear. 
 
 Now all of a sudden we know that the Bible is in fact God telling us what he wants. The problem then becomes deciphering it. The Bible is not as cut and dried as some would like. God seems to undergo a radical personality shift between the OT and the NT, from a God of smiting to a God of love and tolerance. Which part are we to listen to? Do Paul's letters carry the same weight as the Gospel? I'd have alot of questions.
 
 I guess how much I'd change my life depends on how forthcoming God is. Is the only thing we've learned what you've spelled out? God exists, Genesis is correct? If that's all we've got, than I'd still be forced to judge God based on my own ethical standards, same as before.

 I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?

"2240","First, a comment about your second link. Gould had this to say about the quotes on that page:
 
 It seems that creationists are still at it.
 
 Yes. That is one component of evolutionary thought. But there is more to it than that. Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static (as far as the fossil record reveals) for long periods of time, sometimes millions of years. Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly, in a flash of geological time, maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years. Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population. Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them. They agreed with Darwin. Finally, in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin, Dobzhansky, and Mayr. I think their paper, in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events, was published in 1972.
 
 Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.
 
 Nope. It does. Or maybe it supports the hypothesis of successive creation. The fossil record that we find certainly doesn't support the creation as told in the Bible. Even the creationists who went in search of evidence of the flood some 200 years ago realized that the geology didn't support what the Bible said. So they thought that the geology represented many floods, the last one from the Bible being on top.
 
 This objection has already been answer by Gould in the quote above. But of course, what creationists demand is eyedropper precision from a fire hose. Nevertheless, we have some spectacular transitional forms. My favorite is Archaeopteryx. And there is a great progression from four legged land animal to two finned aquatic whales. Some whales in that progression had rear legs that would have been useless for walking.
 
 Really? What evidence is that?","I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time. Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers. Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution. Natural selection in particular but overall evolution. 
 
 If you read Gould's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it. It appears like a response that is back peddling at best. 
 
 As I said, more later.

If you don't get the same results then my conclusions are suspect. One of the defining characteristics of the supernatural is that it doesn't work on demand. So while convincing evidence might appear once, it's unlikely to appear again. This doesn't automatically mean that the supernatural isn't real, or that the original evidence is bogus. It does mean that scientific methods aren't necessarily the right tools to use to judge the supernatural. Science deals with laws, with constants. The supernatural is by definition a bit more flaky.","One cannot have a controled experiment, as one can in the hard sciences. Psychology, anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments. However, as with these other fields, one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend. For example, if people claim to see a supernatural event, take them aside separately to question them about the details. If one can be sure that they didn't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and, nevertheless, the details match, then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural. If this happens consistently, then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural.
 
 Unfortunately, though there are occasional events that remain unexplained, we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation. Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends, it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone's claim toward supernatural proof, which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles. That is unfortunate. If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself, then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo.

 As I said humans follow three catgories, self-preservation, the soical thing, and the need to continue or better the species. We see in the very long term, and have high orders of reasoning that allow us to get what we want.
 That is how we got here, but we see death as something outside our long-term ability to plan for, and that just messes with the need for self-preservation. So, because we are creatures that need to have answers (not because god said so, but because creatures that want the answer on how to get that peice of fruit up in that tree to fall down, will do better then the creature that dosen't care), we create eloborate teachings that allow us to incorporate death into our long-term plans, and that takes away from the whole self-preservation fear. No offense to religious guys, but seriously if you think about it, isn't it convinent that god will let us into heaven. Every culture has some version of eternity written into its teachings, weither it be heaven, rebirth or some nature thing it is what we want to believe. 
 
 I admit in my weaker momments I have really wished I did believe in some kind of god, but the fact remains, most of our lives we act on complex instinct.

 strange enough, if (God forbid) things had gone wrong and our son had stopped in the middle of the street, it is very likely that she would question God's existence.
 
 this is also the reason why atheism is more like a religion. through emotional experiences, rather than deduction and reasoning, people decide whether God exists or not. it also has to do with perception, since there are christians who suffer afflictions similar to yours, and it only strengthens their faith.
 
 yes, emotional stimuli affect all of us, usually with more impactful effects than physical trauma. and yes, we expect a God of spiritual power to appeal to us at least in the emotional sense (since it is the only form of contact believers have with God anyway), and if God cannot be there on an emotional level, then is he really there at all?
