 I said I have had no experience of 'God' but I have had (and some will scoff I know) bizarre, spiritual experiences on LSD and mushrooms, which I have only done a few times (before I get accused of being a spaced-out hippie!).

"9431","""Back in the Roman era, Mithraism was perhaps Christianity's leading competitor for the hearts and minds of others. Today Mithraism is religiously a non-factor, but it still ""competes"" with Christianity, in another way: It is a leading candidate for the ""pagan copycat"" thesis crowd as a supposed source for Christianity.
 
 What has been the point of this diversion? The point is to give the reader a warning, to be on the lookout any time a critic makes some claim about Mithraism somehow being a parallel to Christianity. Check their sources carefully. If, like Acharya S, they cite source material from the Cumont or pre-Cumont era, then chances are excellent that they are using material that is either greatly outdated, or else does not rely on sound scholarship (i.e., prior to Cumont; works by the likes of King, Lajard, and Robertson). Furthermore, if they have asserted anything at all definitive about Mithraic belief, they are probably wrong about it, and certainly basing it on the conjectures of someone who is either not a Mithraic specialist (which is what Freke and Gandy do in The Jesus Mysteries) or else is badly outdated. 
 
 Mithraic scholars, you see, do not hold a candle for the thesis that Christianity borrowed anything philosophically from Mithraism, and they do not see any evidence of such borrowing, with one major exception: ""The only domain in which we can ascertain in detail the extent to which Christianity imitated Mithraism is that of art.""""
 http://tektonics.org/copycat/mithra.html
 
 Of course what I find even more disturbing than the errors of the copy-cat theorists, is the fact they seem to feel the constant need to single our Christianity for these sort of attacks. As if it has EVER worked to do so (it's nothing new), and as if it doesn't reveal a deep-seated prejudice. There's just no other logical reason for the obsession.","Well, you see, it is only Christianity that claims it is new and unique (it isn't though). It is Chrisitanity that is dependant on it's beliefs, (even the very mythical ones) being historically accurate. This wouldn't be a problem at all, except that Christianity also is a 'exclusive' religion, that claims that it is the only right way. 
 
 Of course, if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that Christianity makes, you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize Christianity (for the exact same reasons)",0

 What is God as best defined by you?
 
 Describe the nature of God. What is it that you believe in?","SP: Hello again. I hope you are well. God is difficult to define. One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God. 
 
 However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).
 
 There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right.

"790","I would say that agnosticism is the only rational position, based on verifiable evidence.","When making that evaluation, one should consider what kinds of evidence it is possible to find in support of or to contradict a hypothesis. 
 
 Consider the question: ""Are there any car keys in my kitchen?"", a question I confess to be dear to my heart at this precise moment. Right now you have no information upon which to base an answer. You should rightly be agnostic. But imagine you came to my house and ransacked the kitchen, turning out every drawer, emptying every cupboard, opening all the packets - even the sealed ones - sieving the flour, looking in all the cups and pots and pans, peering (though I don't recommend it) under the fridge, and still found absolutely no sign of any car keys - would you still consider yourself a car-key-kitchen agnostic? 
 
 The moral of the story is that the significance of an absence of evidence very much depends upon how much effort one has expended looking for some. It also depends upon the amount of potential evidence that isn't there.
 
 Returning to our original conundrum, there is no conceivable evidence we could ever find that would definitively prove a creator god does not exist, because a creator god, the way we define it, would be eminently capable of concealing his actions. So although there's no evidence that god does not exist, nor could there be, which rather takes the shine off the observation that there isn't any.
 
 On the other hand, we can imagine endless ways in which a god (faith-specific or otherwise) could be proved to exist. In biology, we would just need to find one organism with a unique amino acid, or that had something other than the common four nucleotides, or a non-vascular plant with seeds or flowers - the evidence we could find to disprove common descent is limitless. Yet we don't; Nature's kitchen has been forensically inspected for car keys, and they're nowhere to be found. In geology or astrophysics, we could find consistent evidence of a young earth, yet we don't. We could verify the efficacy of prayer - yet we don't.
 
 In other words, there's an absolute mountain of potential evidence to support the existence of a god (Christian or otherwise) and none of it's there, despite us looking really, really hard.

 you are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already has

 Frankly I couldn't give a rats arse about it, it's an ancient historical footnote.

In my opinion (as someone who has read a lot of the early church writings) it is clear from writings of very early people like Clement, Ignatius, Justn Martyr, etc that what we consider orthodoxy was indeed orthodoxy from the get-go, and so it is only fair that they had some sense of wanting to keep out writings that they didn't consider accurate or genuine. People sometimes bring this us as if it indicates something bad about Christianity or early Christianity, but why should they have allowed writings into the canon that they considered spurious? (Now whether the canonical writings we have are spurious too is another debate--the bottom line is that THEY--the early Christians--didn't feel at the time that the NT books in our canon were spurious for the most part.) 
 
 Now one of the things people will sometimes say is ""well, THOSE Christians won the day, and the Gnostics/Arians didn't, so there may have been gnostic or Arian writers that got suppressed so we don't really know."" Well, you could ALWAYS make that argument about ANYTHING. We don't come to hard conclusions based on material for which we have no idea was there--a speculative basis--we come to hard conclusions based on what IS there. Sure, there's a general understanding with history the winners write the history, but that doesn't mean we go back and fill in blanks or overwrite what we accept with speculation.",0

To believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, one must have faith. There is no physical evidence that I am aware of to indicate that it did happen the way the Bible said it happened... except for in writings of human beings allegedly inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that those human beings were inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that what they describe actually happened the way they describe it.
 
 What I can say with certainty that cannot be disputed as far as I'm aware, is that whatever happened... happened. If a woman named Mary was impregnated by the Holy Spirit and conceived a child that she named Jesus who was crucified, died and buried, only to come back to life three days later and ascend into heaven after 40 days... then that's what happened.

Then and only then, should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened. We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one.

"9588","By the way, everyone in the world believes in a God.","Nonsense. Almost a billion people are nonreligious.",0
"3014","i think its finally settled that physical (testable or tangible) evidence of God can never be found. this is not only because of its elusive nature to science, but also because of religious requirements.
 
 from a scientic perspective, nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law. that is, physical laws are constant and unbreakable, and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them. because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe, there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do, at least where the phsical realm is concerned. there is no supernatural phenomenon, and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect
 
 from a religious perspective, knowledge of God can only come through faith. we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence, in other word believing without evidence. Hebrews 11:6 says ""And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."" faith is the key to religion, and only through faith can religion be established. therefore, if some physical observation could verify God's existence, then it would contradict what religion says about God. this is a real catch 22. you search for evidence to solidify your faith, but if evidence comes you dont need faith, and without faith you cannot relate to God
 
 in all, as far as i'm concrned, it is totally futile to seek rational proof of God's existence. even if it was found, it wouldnt be found. i remember saying that it is possible to prove that God exists; that is, in the event that God showed up and said ""hey, it's Me!"". but even this can never happen, because such a scenario would contradict the bible, and thus not prove God exists as far as the bible is concerned.
 
 and when all is said and done, it still doesnt answer the question ""does God exist?""","But then it also doesn't answer the question ""does anything exist"", nor does it answer an infinite number of ""existence"" questions. Do ""trolls"" exist, follows the same reasoning. If you find one, they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature, they are some organic life form that can be measured, tested, and quantified..i.e. no longer an imaginary creature. So they can no more be found than god.
 
 So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you'll see why the question ""Does god exist?"", has no real importance in the physical universe.
 (does the tooth fairy exist, does a unicorn exist, do flying pigs exist, etc.)
 
 In fact, I like that statement. The existence of god is not imporant...
 
 Rather - the FAITH in god(s, etc.) is what is ""important"", and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact. 
 
 I think that's why I don't mind so much ""religion"" per se, it's the human condition that brings suffering, and uncertainty, into our lives and for some people, the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition. (the human condition also brings joy, love, etc., but I'd like that without the pain personally)
 
 I only mind it when things in the physical universe are ""attacked"" with the premise of belief in god(s), which is a waste of human energy...we have a limited time, don't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge. And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions.
 
 ...she's a witch because she MADE the crops die...she must be burned. 
 
 ...he broke ""god's"" law and therefore must be guilty..
 
 ...this is ""god's"" war..
 
 Yeah, that still scares me. That's why I think, at least in the US, the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important, and accepted. While there are fundamentalists that rail against it...it's hopefully obvious that with ~80% of the US believing in an imaginary ""god"", but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world, then the two can obviously co-exist, and I'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed.
