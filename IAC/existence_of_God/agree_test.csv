"3093","These aren't the only two options available...","Of course not, nor did I intend to imply that they were. I merely suggest that an increase, through education, in awareness of the diversity of religious belief has led some to a fuzzy-minded many-paths mentality, some to the conclusion that if 99.99% are wrong, there's a strong probability they're all wrong. There are lots of other positions.",1.16666666667,2
"3401","BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either. For the lack of a better word, I believe it is a direction that eventually leads to spiritual death.","I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.",2,2
"4063","This is where some will deny the OT as an anachronism and only refer to the New Commandment and New Covenant.
 
 Of course, by that reasoning - unless selective - Genesis and creation also are anachronisms.","Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.
 
 Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.
 
 The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.
 
 One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws.",2.6,2
"7673","Give a link to your objection and I'll take a look and get to responding when I have more time.","I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.
 If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit.",2.33333333333,2
"3455","hey! i was gonna say the same thing jim just said, whadya know!
 
 but basically, God cannot do the illogical, like create a round square, simply because it cannot be done. it is by nature illiogical for any rock to be unbreakable, no matter how hard it is. in fact, something as simple as adding 2+2 and getting 3 is impossible for God. that doesnt make him less omnipotent, just means that there are certain illogicalities that can never exist","Ditto. To unkerpaulie, you are good! I really enjoyed reading your post, especially the last part: ""just means that there are cerain illogicalities that can never exist"". I would also say that God is also a logical being from whom we derive our logic - which appears to be missing in the original post...
 
 The original post does not put limits on God's power, just, as unkerpaulie said, there are certain illogicalities that can never exist.",3.33333333333,2

"6507","If we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.","It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled ""holy writings"" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves.",1,2
"2105","To me, somehow, it smacks of self-idolatrization, prideful in being ""next"" to God.","What else would you expect from the people who created a god in their own image?
 
 Your thinking here is right, religion has a long history of being egocentric.",1.8,2
"4242","While the comment by ""God-is-real"" may have been unwelcome, you merely prove his point by your prejudicial reaction (lumping all christians together into some category YOU think appropriate).","I apologize for that statement. I just thought that his air of superiority when he was preaching to be simply sickening.",1,2
"4660","Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries. I've just gotten tired of it--and righteously so.","It's interesting that you mention this because this was actually prophesied right from the beginning by God. Down through the centuries, women have been mistreated and often considered to be second-rate humans. This is because of imperfection, an imperfection that God could foresee:
 
 ""Your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you."" (Genesis 3:16)
 
 Obviously men are not without blame too, but ultimately, due to disobedience to God, both Adam and Eve have had to pay the price and so have their offspring.",2.85714285714,2
"2863","I think when trying to prove the xistance of god, you are in a similar situation. You cannot see god, you cannot measure him, though some claim they can feel his presence. 
 
 Personally, I believe in god, and I feel a little sorry for those who don't. Faith in something bigger than yourself, bigger than all mankind, can give you something to hold onto when there seems to be nothing else. 
 
 Personally, I believe in god because sometimes he talks to me. It is like a little voice in the back of your head that gives you nudges inthe right direction (sometimes the voice is not so little). Maybe I am schizo. Maybe it is my subconscious. Personally, I believ it is god. I have never gone wrong heeding that little voice, though I have often walked right into a heap of trouble when I have ignored it. 
 
 Anyway, that is my proof. I don't expect it to convince anybody but me, but there it is.","i like your point on faith and believing in something bigger than yourself. i think man has an instinctive drive to better himself. and everyone believes in something bigger than himself, and its totally in the mind. for some its God. for some its their dreams. for some its their family, community, country, future generations of mankind. whatever it is, it is absolutely based on faith, and it is an element that pushes you to better yourself. faith in something bigger than yourself inspires improvement and self esteem, and i think everybody needs it",3.4,2

"9689","Many on the religious right claim a belief in the existence of Satan and blame him for many of the evils in this world. I am curious why people believe that Satan is responsible for those evils, not men and their weaknesses.","Answers include but are not limited to:
  People need a solution for the Problem of Evil.
  People want to have an ""objective"" standard for good and evil.
  God said it, I believe it, that settles it.",1.8,2
