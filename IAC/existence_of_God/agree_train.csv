"59571","As to whether he can be/do all those things you listed; if he is the almighty omnipotent deity that is claimed, then he can be all those things and more.
 
 He can be any and all gods ever worshipped and ever will be worshipped. He can be the greatest of the great and most wretched of all (at the same time). And all this before breakfast.
 
 It is only the feeble imaginations of mankind that limit him (which isn't that surprising, given that they created him).

I find the devaluing of our experience and the rationale behind our rejection of religion and divinity to be the most perplexing aspect of my dealings with believers. I came to my present working assumptions after a lifetime of soul-searching. I reject the mythology because my mind leaves me no alternative.","I know that I'm hardly unique in rejecting the pious life that my teachers held up as the ideal: I was quite conscious at the time that I was merely a square peg in a round hole that was being bashed until it fitted. Parroting answers to questions that were themselves irrational wasted an absurd amount of time of course - but in other respects I received a good education for which I am still grateful.

"2090","This Pauline gospel of a dying and rising savior bore unmistakable similarity to many of the Greek and Roman mystery cults which had similar stories. Paul's description of the eucharist as a Christian mystery lent further support to this view. But there were notable differences as well.

Hutchinson, McGraw-Hill, 1991, p417)","Yes, there are differences, but the claim is not that the other stories were identical, just that they preceded the time Jesus is claimed to have lived, and that elements of these various ""foreshadowing"" stories were very similar to those told about Jesus.

"61542","let me try to translate into words
 1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds
 2. there being a god is a possibility
 3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one
 4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)
 5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds
 6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world
 7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds
 8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.
 9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world< is false.
 10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3
 
 Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.","i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular english
 
 and yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proof
 
 just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...
 
 does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticon_frazzled",2

 If I say that I worship Him because he is powerful, beautiful and has loved me greatly, does that mean you now get to argue those points and say he is not any of those. I would say you do not get to argue my assumptions about God as they are mine. YOu may argue my conclusions based on my assumptions but you could not argue my assumptions, nor I yours.
