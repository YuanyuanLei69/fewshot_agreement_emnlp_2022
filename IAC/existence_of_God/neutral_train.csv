 Most elucidating, and worth quoting is:
 
 In the Syballine Oracles, written by an Egyptian Jew probably between 163 and 45 B.C., the author compared Jews to the other nations: The Jews 
 &#8220;are mindful of holy wedlock, and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children, as do Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Romans, specious Greece and many nations of others, Persians and Galatians and all Asia.&#8221; 
 
 And in our times, sex historian Amo Karlen wrote that according to the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, &#8220;Homosexuality was phenomenally rare among Orthodox Jews.&#8221; 
 
 To a world which divided human sexuality between penetrator and penetrated, Judaism said, &#8220;You are wrong &#8212; sexuality is to be divided between male and female.&#8221; 
 
 To a world which saw women as baby producers unworthy of romantic and sexual attention, Judaism said, &#8220;You are wrong &#8212; women must be the sole focus of men's erotic love.&#8221; 
 
 To a world which said that sensual feelings and physical beauty were life's supreme goods, Judaism said, &#8220;You are wrong &#8212; ethics and holiness are the supreme goods.&#8221; 
 
 A thousand years before Roman emperors kept naked boys, Jewish kings were commanded to write and keep a sefer torah, a book of the Torah. ....nothing moved me more than the Talmudic law that Jews were forbidden to sell slaves or sheep to non-Jews, lest the non-Jews engage in homosexuality and bestiality. That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud, and in which, earlier, the Bible was written. Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches, I always respond, 
 i &#8220;That there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah.&#8221; 
 
 The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world, too against man's nature, to have been solely man-made. 
 
 The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing. It took a constant delaying of gratification, and a re-channeling of natural instincts; and these disciplines have not always been well received. There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization, not infrequently by Jews (through radical politics) and Christians (through anti-Semitism). 
 
 The bedrock of this civilization, and of Jewish life, has been the centrality and purity of family life. But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected. The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros. The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress.

 Quick fix
 
 Comparative Religions teacher Cherie McGinn has always been aware of atheism among her students, but says that it is often a temporary belief. McGinn feels atheism can often be a ""quick fix"" for students who are still searching or need a way to declare their independence.
 
 ""It's easier to say 'I don't believe in God' than to say, 'I believe in this,"" McGinn explains. According to McGinn, most people who claim to be atheists are probably agnostic, or people who do not believe God's existence can be proved either way. ""It takes a strong level of commitment and understanding to be a true atheist,"" says McGinn.","The ""truth"" about atheism is that it's the only proposition that makes sense (apart from agnosticism ?) to people who conclude, as I do, that religious principles are not based on reason.
 I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with ""divine service"", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, ""Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !"" , and I had received no such gift. 
 Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.",1

"9632","You are assuming that God (if there is one) is not somehow sustaining His creation. Once again, this cannot be proven nor disproven by science as it cannot be tested or observed - as you said in your original topic starting post. But it is reasonable to believe, that if there is a God who created the whole universe, then without Him sustaining it somehow, it would cease to exist - hence, since it does exist, it is logical to believe that He is somehow sustaining it (obviously not as much as He can). So, if true, the observations that we see and/or take, are the effects of God acting on His creation; and miracles can be explained in such a way to say that it is God just acting on a part of His creation in a different way, this is not only plausible but logical.","as far as all observable evidence dictates, the laws of nature are what sustains the universe. there is not one single function of nature that isnt on ""autopilot"" as it were. that is, no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law. what's more, nothing that defies natural law (whether universe-sustaining or not) ever occurs in observable reality
 
 
 I'm glad you responded Nu Leader. this is this issue that really hits the religion/science divide. as it is, God has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm. there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of God, or a manifestation of supernatural power. in other words, in the realm of the physical, God has no turf. even if God does exist, he does not (and by biblical definition, cannot) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his power
 
 this leaves us with the spiritual realm. this realm, whether it exists or not, does affect people. yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as God himself. the same realm that God is believed to abive and reign in, is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die. i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality, but for now i think its sufficient to say that God is limited to the spiritual realm only",1
"1136","as for the proof, its really not a proof at all. if God is defined as a perfect being in reality, that does not mean that God exists. if i define a ufo as a flying spacecraft from another planet in reality, that does not make such things exist. its just a definition. i really dont see how that can be even considered a proof
 
 basically, the definition: ""a being possessing every perfection and every positive attribute"" is not a true definition, because both perfection and positive attributes are subjective. so theres really nothing to work with here
 
 God, by this definition, doesnt exist","Well, according to Descartes, if I have an idea of a most perfect being, I shall distinctly perceive that such a being must contain all perfections - including reality in every degree. So this idea also contains existence. God's essence is to exist, and of no other thing can this be said. (Existence in everything else being contingent.)

"9668","""There is far more proof needed to reasonably believe what's asserted in the Bible than there are for most things. ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" - Carl Sagan. I think that statement really is true. Just imagine a couple statements I could make and what the proper reactions should be to them.
 
 
 
 1. I was sitting in my room last night and I got a call from a friend of mine.
 
 The normal response is ""ok"". Everybody has phones, most people have friends, people calling their friends is a very normal thing to do... if this is the only statement I make about that call, there's really no reason for anybody to question the validity of it.
 
 
 2. I was sitting in my room last night, and a stranger wearing a black trenchcoat came and knocked on my door.
 
 This statement should be questioned somewhat. A person wearing a black trenchcoat during the summer in Florida is odd, but not the craziest thing anyone's ever seen probably... it does need to be explained though.. more detail is needed to conclude that this probably did happen. I should be able to explain the reason this happened adequately for somebody to believe that this actually happened.
 
 3. Last night I was sitting in my room and the walls started bleeding, then several of our founding fathers' ghosts walked out of my closet and told me it was my mission to make sure that church and state remain seperate.
 
 Everyone that hears me say that, should automatically say ""no"", until I provide some amazing, concrete proof of that. We know about the physical makeup of my bedroom walls, they can't bleed. The idea of ghosts from the past coming to visit people I would imagine is 100% foreign to just about everyone... so nobody's word should be taken on that either.
 
 
 
 This is the problem with the resurrection and miracles of Jesus... believers think we should believe it's true and just give it the kind of inspection like in number 1 or maybe number 2, but they're things that nobody living today has actually witnessed anything similar to... it defies the laws of science and nature to the extent that we know them... and the closest evidence we have of them is a couple eye-witness accounts (questionably), which weren't even written within 15 years of his death. There is no rational basis for believing it based on this... ANY feasible explanation that falls within the realm of reason and nature should ALWAYS be taken over any explanation which turns to the supernatural and irrational.""

NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you. God existed BEFORE time. Chew on that one a bit. Eternality implies an existence outside of time. And in fact, much of science alludes to this possibility. I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications.

 But then you throw in ""reasoned faith"". But then you are making up terms that try to show faith as reason. What is reasoned faith?

 If your faith is even part of your ""evidence"" or ""reason"" for belief, then logically the entire claim is arrived at through circular reasoning. You can use both all you like, I'm just letting you know it's fallacy to claim faith as evidence, which you do. If you do not, then you are using reason, and not faith, and we don't need to continue because I see no fallacy in using evidence to back your claim.

"9623","The ""truth"" about atheism is that it's the only proposition that makes sense (apart from agnosticism ?) to people who conclude, as I do, that religious principles are not based on reason.
 I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with ""divine service"", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, ""Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !"" , and I had received no such gift. 
 Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.","I'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist (except for going to a religious school.
 
 I didn't really think it was fair and balanced at all. It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path. The reasons it gave for being atheist were they hadn't found god yet, and a tradgedy. What about logically thinking about it? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase? They also say atheism is the easy way out. I think it's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted. I'm not saying people do but I'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism. All you have to do is believe in god and you're safe for your life and afterwards. Most Atheists don't believe what they do just to rebel or haven't found God yet. Mostly it's because they realized that there is no logical proof (enough for them) that there is God. They also said incorrectly that atheism isn't a religion.

 Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too! 
 
 George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.
 
 Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626 emoticon_xbye
 
 BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.
 
 You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.
 
 There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need emoticon_idea",1

"276","I have never received an actual explanation for the doctrine of eternal damnation from anyone I've asked. It is something I struggled with before turning to Atheism, something I tried desperately to rationalize, and was one of the main points that LED to me becoming Atheist
 
 Many Christians claim that their God is omnipotent/omniscient. They claim that their God is a god of compassion, love, and mercy. Yet, with all of this, they claim that God punishes all people who do not accept Jesus as their savior with eternal torment in Hell, i.e. the vast majority of mankind numbering into the billions. 
 
 What possible compassionate purpose can infinite torture have? The punishment doesn't even serve a remedial purpose because the tormented one is not allowed to repent. It's only conceivable purpose (to me at least) is sadism.
