There may be a maniac hiding in your house. He doesn't want his existance known, and you have no evidence he's there. However, it will have a big impact on your reality when you wander into the room he's in. Likewise, most modern Gods don't seem inclined to demonstrate their existance, but most religions say that if you don't do what their God says, there will be consequences when you die. I would say that if a diety can't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants, then I'm not going to change the way I lead my life based on what people who claim to speak for him say.

 Suppose that God is in fact all-powerful. If he is all-powerful, then he can do anything. Yet this raises the question, ""If God can do anything, can he make a rock so hard that he himself cannot break it?""
 
 If the answer is yes, then God cannot break this rock, so there is something he cannot do.
 
 If the answer is no, then he cannot make such a rock, and thus there is also something he cannot do.
 
 Therefore, it is impossible that God can do everything, and it is thus impossible for him to be all powerful.
 
 I can't claim originality for this proof, but I have never heard any good refutation of it, and yet people still act as if God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion. :xbanghead If there is a refutation, then I'd like to hear it.","The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.
 
 The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.",-3.4,0
