"5297","Simply put, the majority of Christian teaching today differs a lot from when Jesus started it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that the majority of so-called ""Christians"" today are an insult to Jesus. Jesus used the bible when speaking to his people and he condoned it. Therefore, as Christians you have to follow ALL the bible. Not just pick and choose which bits you like. Christendom today gives true Christians a bad name, it is false worship. Take a look at these examples of ""Christians"" that go against what the bible teaches:
 
 The Roman Catholic Church permits the worship of Jesus' mother marry. This tradition has PAGAN origin (http://bupc.montana.com/whores/marywors.html) and was not part of the Christian faith. Even worse, the bible condemns any worship that isn't directed at God - Deuteronomy 5:9; 6:13 (Jesus himself refered to this scripture when the devil was trying to temp him). One of the ten commandments strictly forbids worshipping anything other than God (Idolatry).
 
 Plenty religions permit idolatry, which is a great defiance of God's word - ""You must not have any other gods against my face. You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them.""-Ex. 20:3-5. And here are plenty other scriptures not permitting idol worship:
 Rom. 6:14; 1#Cor. 6:9, 10; 10:7, 14; 2#Cor. 6:16; Gal. 5:19, 20; 1#John 5:21; Rev. 21:8; 22:15.
 
 What do you define as idol worship?
 
 ""The giving of absolute devotion and ultimate trust to something that is not God; immoderate attachment or veneration for something; respect or love that approaches that due a divine power.""-Webster's Third New International Dictionary.
 
 Do you not see church members bowing down/praying at pictures, statutes, shrines etc?
 
 Christmas
 
 Christmas is the biggest joke of Christendom. Christmas didn't get it's origin from the bible or early Christians. Jesus never once said to celebrate his birth, yet he did say to celebrate his death (i.e. what his life accomplishment has achieved) through a memorial, or ""Lords supper"" (this is a serious comemoration that doesn't need any showy displays) - ""Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, 'Take, eat; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.'"" On that occasion Jesus also commanded, as reported by the apostle Paul: ""Do this in remembrance of me."" Matt. 26:26-28; 1#Cor. 11:24
 
 To say that Christmas is Christian just goes to prove you don't know anything about it's origin. It started from the Winter Festivals which was a period where cultures celebrated the ""rest period"" (agricultural activity was put on hold during the cold seaon). - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_holiday_season
 This in itself is a direct contradiction of the belief that Jesus was born at Christmas - would sheperds have been out looking after the sheep (as in the Nativity)? The idea that Jesus was born at Christmas was simply made up. 
 
 Another reason why Christmas isn't Christian is it's pagan attributes Yule and Saturnalia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas
 Christians are to shun paganism.

 I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that ""concepts"", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.

"7642","To expound on my last post:
 And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books. Funny how easy this book gets a pass. If we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.
 
 In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.
 
 However, in regards to the Bible, skeptics overturn the use of Occam's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible's claims. Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day, still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true.
 
 Double standard much?","Ah, but then, it might not have been Homer. 
 But then again, whether it was Homer or someone else, isn't earth shattering.
 
 Much like whether it was Julius Caesar who crossed the Rubicon, or a decoy of his.
 
 Now, if we found an account from Roman times of how Julius Caesar split the waters of the Rubicon by urinating in it so his troops could pass...Occam's Razor would not point towards accepting it as true.

 The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the son of God subject to a shameful death (Wisdom of Solomon ""Let us condemn him with a shameful death""). Paul refers to the ""archons"", the evil heavenly rulers of the age, as those who crucified Jesus (1 Cor 2:8) and extols the justice of the Romans (Ro. 13:1-3). The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection (Kloppenborg). No earthly Jesus, no crucifixion, no death. It is all myth, man.

"1035","What would you consider as constituting the soul if it does not include our personalities?
 
 As for god, I agree that the existence of god is not disproven but the discoveries of Science have very much limited the detailed roles that were originally ascribed to him. What, then, is left for the role of god? 
 
 What ""evidence"" is there for God? Are you speaking of people's personal experiences? I always wondered what specifically in those experiences made people think that they were experiencing God - where they thought that no other explanations could be valid. 
 
 I agree that one can always think of ways to claim that scientific evidence of, say, Evolution was purposely planted by God as a test of mankind, and other such explanations. If one assumes an omnipotent God, then ANY evidence or logic can be discarded. It just seems that many of those who discard scientific findings jump through tremendous hoops to avoid addressing the evidence.","I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.
 
 As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.
 
 I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or ""not god"" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.
