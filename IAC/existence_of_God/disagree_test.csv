 I'm not sure omnipresence is the definitive word to use because it implies that there is something 'other' than is 'present' everywhere, alongside or behind every point in the universe. My POV is that 'God' literally is the universe, every particle, every wave, every field.
 
 This certainly implies awareness of everything within the universe and all past events, but if you include knowledge of future events in the term 'omniscience' I am not so sure; time is another dimension like the spatial dimensions but it is very different in terms of what happens when you 'travel' along it compared to travelling through space, so I have never been able to view 4D spacetime as literally 4 equivalent dimensions; it is 3 space dimensions plus time.

 More proof to prove my point, thanks!
 
 
 
 It does not matter what the document contains! The same procedure should be done for every document. What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity! You wrongly use Occam's Razor as well. If the document is well preserved, has many copies, has copies relatively close to the original, etc, then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source. Then and only then, should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened. We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one. Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar's expeditions, but yet again, we accept them as fact in our history books.
 
 But, it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river. While he didn't do that, he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later. Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment. Should we discount this too because it 'doesn't seem practical' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it?

Thanks again for proving my point I guess.","Ah, if you'd just waited fifteen minutes, you wouldn't have posted this scathing accusation of unfairness before I explained precisely why your accusation is nothing but fabrication.

 God already had angels within his kingdom when he made man. Some angels felt that God loved his humans more than themselves. In their jealous vanity, they rebelled against God. Bad idea, considering his power and all. God hates vanity. Thus he condemned Satan to rule over hell. 
 When man disobeyed God's rule concerning partaking of the fruit of knowledge, God made a pact with man that gave him the burden of choice. He must choose right from wrong. Suffer the consequences of bad choices, reap the benefits of righteousness. Satan just happens to be there to take care of those who choose the wrong path.

"7194","That much can be said. But we can provide evidence for the existence of God in other ways that require us to use logic and reasoning. We might reason for instance, say that if Jesus' body was still rotting in the tomb, then it is most likely that the authorities would have displayed it in order to crush the Christian faith (for they had every motive to). And if they had produced the corpse, then it is almost certain that Christianity would have been destroyed (for the early Christians believed in nothing less than the literal bodily resurrection). Given that the faith was not destroyed, it is implausible that His body was still in the tomb. Of course, there is a whole lot more to consider than this.
 
 Furthermore, a miraclous event (such as Jesus' resurrection) is improbable on the assumption that the miracle did not occur - but is to be expected on the assumption that it did. That is, if there was no resurrection, the emergence of Christianity is highly improbable; but if there was a resurrection, the emergence of Christianity is very likely. This is in the form ""if A happened, then it is most likely that B"".","yes, on the grounds of ""mostly likely"" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.
 
 part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)",-1.2,0

 God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator. 
 God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature. 
 Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute. 
 The are absolute because there is an absolute God. 
 The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue.","this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic",-3,0
"5377","How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?
 
 Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.
 
 How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? 
 In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?","the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god. since logic exists, god is not needed.
 
 i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist? why? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase. this would occur with or without god's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true. logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god's presmce either. the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained, the less god is needed.

"4239","I like your thinking, although I disagree with it. You say that God is the universe. I propose that God is relational. That without a relational god we are truly hopeless.","Why? I have heard variations on this many times and it utterly baffles me. Why do you feel we need a divine being who is interested in us, personally and collectively, for us to have any 'hope'? Hope, for me, as in hope for humanity, comes from what I see around me as being the positive qualities that we have as a race.
 
 I cannot believe that a universal consciousness would care (in terms of what we humans think of as caring) about what happens to us in the long run, because the long run is either heat death or big crunch. If we are still around in this unimaginably distant future we may well have developed means to avoid the same fate as the universe, but if we don't, or if we die out before that, then that's that. End of story.
 
 This is kind of tied in to the question I had trouble answering before, the answer to which I am still having problems defining: If God is the universe, he/she/it is also every one of us, every particle as I said before. If you look at the history of the planet in terms of particles, it's all just one dynamic system, the rocks, the oceans, the atmosphere, and the biosphere as well. The plants and creatures on this planet are made of atoms that used to be part of the rocks, oceans, and atmosphere. From this singular perspective there is no distinction between the living and the non-living parts of the planet; it's one colossal biochemical reaction.
 
 I will concede that it is possible that this 'God' entity might be aware of our own consciousness, because according to my own logic the entity also is the matter that constitutes our brains, and it is certainly the case that many people believe God has spoken to them. Some of these people are treated as having had religious experiences, some are treated as having lost their sanity. 
 
 However this in no way leads me to contemplate the idea that the Bible, Koran, Hindu Vedas etc are any more revelatory truths than are the Greek Myths or the Aboriginal Dreamtime; these are human constructs.

 It would not have thought processes that we as humans could in any way relate to, and given the predictability of physical phenomena according to the laws we have discovered it would not seem to be able to will anything to happen, but it could still have a sense of itself and an awareness of everything within it.

"5144","Miracles, such as Jesus' resurrection, can provide evidence for a religious belief, which hence, provides evidence for God's existence, following directly from a principle which J. L. Mackie has defended, and requires no assumptions about violations of natural laws. The principle states that a piece of evidence raises the likelihood of a hypothesis whenever that evidence is more likely given the hypothesis. The principle follows from the axioms of probability and is central to common sense reasoning. Footprints in the dirt confirm that someone has been walking there since the footprints are more likely to be there given that someone did walk there. The sound of the siren suggests that there is a fire nearby, for a siren is more likely to be heard when there is a fire nearby.
 
 Antony Flew and Mackie both agree that while miracles are extremely improbable, their occurrence is more likely on the assumption that God exists. More specific religious beliefs may rise further the likelihood of a miracle. So it follows from Mackie's criterion of confirmation that the occurrence of miralces may confirm religious hypotheses. For instance, since the resurrection of Jesus is far more likely on the assumption that He was divine, the resurrection, if we knew it to have occurred, would confirm Jesus' divinity and thus the truth of the Bible and it's revelation about God and His existence. Of course, it does not prove it, but it does provide substantial support.","again, this is only good as a reasonable assumption, and nothing more. in many cases, the least likely answer is true. you cannot create evidence out of assumptions. you test the assumptions against reality, then the assumptions can be confirmed. i agree that reasonable assumptions are useful, but basing an assumption upon another assumption causes the likeliness to decrease.
 
 for example, under the assumption that (a) jesus is devine, and that (b) God exists, it is likely that (c) jesus performed miracles. c can only be considered a reasonable assumption of a and b were already true. since a and b are assumptions themselves, then it makes c much more unlikely.
 
 as opposed to the case of the footprints. if (a) people wear shoes and (b) there is a footprint in the lawn, it is likely that (c) a person stood on the lawn. in this case, a and b are verifiable, and by they being true, we can consider c a reasonable assumption",-1.5,0
