"4797","When Christianity, or the Politicalzation of Religion has gone wrong, there is a standard, a moral standard, that declares this wrong. 
 
 Consider, Nuremburg Trails, when the Nazis said, they were just answering to a higher authority and follow Party power, the judge declared, that they broke their own Laws, and they would answer to a HIGHER POWER - GOD.
 
 Case closed, we over road their relativism, or Nazis morality and condemned many to death.","Which is what they did to the Jews.",1,2
"4134","I am gravely offended by those who claim to be on a first name basis with God, who claim to know exactly what it is that God wants and believes/
 
 To me, somehow, it smacks of self-idolatrization, prideful in being ""next"" to God.","What else is new?",2.6,2
"753","With respect to the influence of Mithra on Christianity, I think the jury is still out. We need to distinguish between the ancient Persian god Mithra as opposed to the 1st through 3rd century Roman cult of Mithraism. The two may not be related.","I realize you said ""the jury is still out"", which indicates that if I present evidence for one side, that does not settle it: especially if the statement is some 15 years old. However, the quote is fairly relevant and I know right where to find it, so what the heck not post it.",2,2
"5873","BTW, I think Anthony Flew is wrong about the Christian God.","You don't say!",2.2,2
"109","We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with.","This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.",3,2
"5097","We can only conceive of god in very rudimentary primitive concepts because of our immature and very limited intellect.","A good starting point is to get educated and be done with it....",1.28571428571,2
"1919","I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.","Well, one can't be truly logical and not be an atheist (or at least agnostic.) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic. Faith and logic are poles apart.
 
 Keep truckin' Jim! Happy weekend to you bro.",3.4,2
"5961","i totally agree with this point, Mach. it is useless to give God definitions that include the impossible or illogical. thats what this whole debate is about. its imperative that we limit what can be done to what is logically possible. it is not logically possible to foresee the future and then cause the future to be different that what was foreseen. omniscient can only be defined as ""knowing all that can be possibly known"", and similarly omnipotent as ""able to do anything that can possibly be done""
 
 if you want to argue that God cannot do or know EVERYTHING, then you should win that easily, since EVERYTHING includes the logical and illogical. but defining God as able to do anything possible, then you have a much better frame to work with","Right.
 
 And it's much easier to argue the root cause, as you pushed for on this forum as well, since you have to deal with fewer arguments. There's no reason to argue about ""can god lift an unliftable rock"", if you start at the begining...define god.
