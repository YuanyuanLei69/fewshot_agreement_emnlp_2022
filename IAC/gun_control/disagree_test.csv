"4144","BS. Where is the raw data... The link you show is from www.gunowners.org over there and does not give links to the raw data so it is probably skewed to make themselves look better. 
 
 Your own words condemn you","There called footnotes The GOA is peppered with them not like the made up XXXX from the brady bunch and other civil rights violators like yourself. 
 
 Why don't you try disputing facts than making up stories and childishly trying to copy me.
 
 Here lets start with this.... Please read and explain to me how (if) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr. Civil-Rights violator:
 
 
 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.
 
 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.
 
 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are ""just statistics.""
 
 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.
 
 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.
 
 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.
 
 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.
 
 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.
 
 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should ""put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run"" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).
 
 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.
 
 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.
 
 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.
 
 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a ""state"" militia.
 
 14. These phrases: ""right of the people peaceably to assemble,"" ""right of the people to be secure in their homes,"" ""enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,"" and ""The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people"" all refer to individuals, but ""the right of the people to keep and bear arm"" refers to the state.
 
 15. ""The Constitution is strong and will never change."" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.
 
 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.
 
 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't ""military weapons"", but private citizens shouldn't have ""assault rifles"", because they are military weapons.
 
 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.
 
 19. The NRA's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign is responsible social activity.
 
 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.
 
 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.
 
 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is ""an accident waiting to happen"" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are ""preying on their fears.""
 
 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.
 
 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.
 
 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.
 
 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a ""weapon of mass destruction"" or an ""assault weapon.""
 
 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.
 
 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.
 
 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.
 
 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.
 
 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.
 
 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.
 
 33. We should ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.
 
 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.
 
 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.
 
 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.
 
 37. ""Assault weapons"" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.
 
 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.
 
 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.
 
 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to ""keep guns out of the wrong hands."" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",-3.6,0

 I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest ""logic switching"". (or, at least attempting to)
 
 Rather than admit wrongness, (very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end. Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical ""detours"". 
 
 After all, if objects have no inherent evil or goodness, it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used.
 
 If this is so, you can't call guns bad. This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen. Therefore, since simone's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object (a gun) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these ""evil"" items are not ""evil"" when used by police. If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error, you will have no choice but to arrive in error's destination: make believe land! Where matches burn down houses! And knives cause slashings! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls!....AND......AND.....GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS!
 
 Well, simone. We're down to brass tacks. Is a gun bad, or is it the determination of the person who uses it?
 
 Because if a gun is bad, then we live in la-la land. And if a gun is an inanimate object who's user is responsible for how it is used, you have no argument for why law abiding people can't posess them and be capable of the determination (As police do) for using them in a responsible manner.

Bush and Kerry both seemed to favor gun-control in the debate, but Kerry seems to believe more strongly in it.","30 million Russian citizens killed.
 5-12 million German citizens (depending on the source you read) along with 6 million Jewish people killed.
 An estimated 100 million Chinese citizens killed.
 20 million Africans killed in various countries in Africa.
 2 million Cambodians slaughtered.
 
 This is just the first 5 off the top of my head that occured in the world during the 20th Century. All occured after sweeping gun control took place and forced disarmament of citizens.
 
 In America, every state that has enacted restrictive gun control has seen an increase in crime, police brutality, questionable law enforcement practices such as violations of 4th amendment rights and so on. Washington DC enacted a total handgun ban in 1976, if you look at the crime rate reports from the years before and the years after that took effect, the truth is very telling. 
 
 In Britain and Australia, both nations enacted sweeping gun bans and forced confiscation. The crime rates of both nations has skyrocketed. Violent crime has especially increased in both countries as criminals realize they have little to fear from their victims now. Reports of police brutality in both nations is on the rise. 
 
 A consequence of the gun ban in Britain is the repeal of their guarantee of a quick and fair trial. This bit of legislation basically allows a suspect to be held indefinitely without a trial or even being notified of the crimes he or she is accused of. 
 
 For a very telling reason against gun control, I recommend you watch the UN Gun Debate between Rebecca Peters and Wayne LaPierre. Then, examine the international poll results online from the debate. 
 
 Gun control kills. History has proven this over and over again. I know that some gun control advocates have the best of intentions at heart but what they fail to realize is that by opening that door, they allow those with less than the best intentions to take advantage of the situation. This is exactly what Hitler did in 1938. He took advantage of the 1935 gun control act of Germany. He used it to find his enemies and eliminate them. 
 
 Is over 150 million victims of gun control reason enough for you? It is for me.

 Those people who ""you don't know (what they may do)""? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free.

The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall ""back in the day"" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police.

 The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
 
 The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.
 
 Some points I have for you:
 
 1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.
 
 Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:
 
 ""Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy."" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm
 
 Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.
 
 2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:
 
 http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151
 
 The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.
 
 So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.
 
 3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.
 
 4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?","Thank you for your reply kelvin90701.
 
 I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:

You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
 
 
 
 So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns? 
 
 If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?

"3700","City Hall &#8211; Speaker Christine C Quinn, together with Council Member Al Vann, today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent. The legislation would also enhance the Department of Consumer Affairs&#8217; enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law. Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jonathan Mintz and Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt joined the Speaker and Council Members at the announcement. The officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys.
 
 &#8220;Despite the fact that New York City&#8217;s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns,&#8221; said Council Speaker Quinn. &#8220;Our communities are at risk when they cannot tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real. Children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities.&#8221;
 
 The City Council&#8217;s Consumer Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon. The proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from $1,000 to up to $5,000. It would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from $3,000 to up to $8,000. Finally, it would also permit DCA to seal, for up to five days, the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period.
 
 Current law imposes a fine of up to $1,000 but does not increase that amount for subsequent violations. Since 2002, DCA has removed more than 7,200 imitation guns from the shelves of nearly 240 stores throughout the city and levied $2.4 million in fines.
 
 Today, the City also announced a new subway advertising campaign, to be displayed in 2,100 subway cars, all 468 subway stations and more than 5,400 buses. The campaign warns New Yorkers of the dangers of realistic-looking toy guns and the dangers of real guns that are painted to look like toys. The campaign&#8217;s advertisements demonstrate potential confusion about gun coloration and warn people that it is illegal either to make a fake gun look real or make a real gun look like a toy. New Yorkers are encouraged to call 311 about either problem. Calls to 311 that concern real guns that look fake will be forwarded to the Police Department&#8217;s Gun Stop hotline. Callers can receive a $1,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction and can remain anonymous. The City has received a grant from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services to support the ad campaign.
 
 &#8220;Gun violence is plaguing the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights neighborhoods that I represent, as well as communities across the city and country,&#8221; said Council Member Al Vann, prime sponsor of the bill. &#8220;When I introduced this legislation, my intentions were also to stem the glorification of guns within our communities, and push the businesses that we patronize to be responsible members of our neighborhoods. I will continue working to address gun violence and its underlying issues. In light of the senseless shooting that occurred in my district Sunday night, it is apparent that we must work more diligently to stem the violence that is afflicting our neighborhoods.&#8221;
 
 &#8220;There is little debate that realistic-looking toy guns pose a serious threat to the safety and welfare of police officers and New Yorkers as a whole,&#8221; stated Deputy Majority Leader Leroy Comrie. &#8220;Sadly, violence resulting from toy guns has happened too many times in this city. This bill is a common sense solution to a very serious threat to our safety.&#8221;
 
 &#8220;Toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys threaten the safety of our dedicated police officers and our children, especially during this holiday season,&#8221; said Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt. &#8220;This public awareness campaign will help to educate the public about the dangers posed by these guns.&#8221; 
 
 &#8220;Imitation firearms that look real are not party items to be wrapped up and given as gifts during the holiday season, and they&#8217;re certainly not toys,&#8221; said Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jonathan Mintz. &#8220;DCA appreciates the Council&#8217;s strong and unequivocal message to the City&#8217;s retailers who must do right by their customers and their communities by keeping these dangerous items off their shelves forever.&#8221;
 
 &#8220;With the holiday season in full swing, it is particularly important to bring attention to the fact that toy guns can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or death,&#8221; said Council Member Maria del Carmen Arroyo, Co-Chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. &#8220;Time and time again our communities are at risk and at serious danger when someone carries what is perceived to be a fake gun. I want to thank the Speaker and the Administration for strengthening the penalties in hopes that repeat offenders cease to sell improper toy guns.&#8221; 
 
 &#8220;Last month an there was an unfortunate incident in my district where a young teen was shot by police because they mistook his toy gun for a fake one,&#8221; said Council Member Larry Seabrook. &#8220;We need to hold these toy gun sellers accountable for selling such a heinous product. Our children&#8217;s lives are at stake. It is my hope that these penalties will finally deter stores from selling these toys. Our communities need to work together. I ask when they see someone selling bad toy guns or when they see someone concealing a real gun for a fake one to call 311.&#8221;
 
 &#8220;This legislation will help prevent further violence by deterring businesses from selling toy guns that look real,&#8221; said Council Member Melissa Mark-Viverito. &#8220;The increased regulations created by this bill will not only prevent toy guns from being used to commit crimes, but also will avert children from being wounded or killed by confused police officers who mistake their toy for a real gun.&#8221;
 
 &#8220;Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E. fully supports the action to increase penalties for store owners who are repeat offenders of the law and we agree that the city should have the authority to shut down such establishments and prevent their further endangering lives of our children and safety of community, said Jackie Rowe Adams, Co-founder. 
 
 Under New York City&#8217;s Public Safety Law, it is against the law to sell or offer to sell any toy or imitation firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm unless the exterior surface of the toy or imitation firearm is predominantly brightly colored. The range of acceptable colors includes white, bright red, bright orange, bright yellow, bright green, bright blue, bright pink or bright purple.","The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense.

 Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word ""carry""-a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary's twenty-sixth definition of ""carry"" is ""bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one."" 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. Webster's defines ""carry"" as ""to move while supporting,"" not just in a vehicle, but also ""in one's hands or arms."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase ""carry arms or weapons"" as
 
 ""To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person."" Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).
 
 These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the ""carrying of arms"" to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person ""carries a weapon."" But to say that is not to deny that one may also ""carry a weapon"" tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.
 
 Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word ""carries"" in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of ""carry,"" a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column ""carries"" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.",-1.33333333333,0

 Bellesiles Misfires 
 An antigun ""scholar"" as today's Galileo? Oh please, just shoot me. 
 
 BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL 
 Friday, February 6, 2004 12:01 a.m. EST 
 
 History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses, men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it. There's the hemlocked Socrates, the house-arrested Galileo, the exiled Rousseau. And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles.
 
 Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book ""Arming America."" An academic bombshell, the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns. This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights. Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise, becoming an instant academic star.
 
 That is, until his peers started looking into that little thing called research. Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records, travel narratives, and other documents. Mr. Bellesiles, when asked to explain, provided ever-more outlandish excuses: that his notes had been lost in a flood, that his Web site had been hacked, that he couldn't remember where he'd found certain documents. The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award, he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book. Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal.
 
 But oh, no. It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse, his nonexistent guns still blazing. Soft Skull Press (which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin) has not only agreed to reissue ""Arming America"" but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles's latest response to his critics. This 59-page pamphlet, ""Weighed in an Even Balance,"" is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world's latest misunderstood genius. As such, it's worth reading for pure entertainment value.
 
 
 
 
 
 Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor's creative excuses and dissembling. He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government (though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize, right?). He does acknowledge a few errors, but only after pointing out that ""even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes."" As proof, he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman.
 But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth. And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display. The very title of his book is taken from Job: ""Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may known mine integrity.""
 
 And that's just for starters. The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men, all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles's argument that he is fighting the good fight. We hear from Isaiah Berlin: ""Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth."" One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century, Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle. We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons.
 
 We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement, the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration. And finally, in case readers still aren't getting his drift, Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion: ""There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain, unchanging past. The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect, it is dangerously undemocratic, and as such should be of concern to every modern historian.""
 
 
 
 
 
 In fact, the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change. If it were, we'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth. Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity. But before they completely cast aside mountains of research, they usually demand some proof. Mr. Bellesiles's problem isn't that he's misunderstood; it's that he still hasn't given them any.
 Or as the old saying goes: ""To be a persecuted genius, you not only have to be persecuted; you also have to be right.""
