And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.
 
 Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.

So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this?

 To Jon S. Vernick; Lisa M. Hepburn
 A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts.
 http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf
 Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect.
 California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law, twice what the federal government has passed.
 
 We publish the gun laws for several states, and distribute books on the subject for 24 states. Our definition for a gun law, while slightly different than yours, is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books.
 
 If it affects private ownership, possession or use of firearms, it is included. A huge list of laws that are not included, which would raise the counts dramatically, is printed in the front of each of our books (e.g., regs for police, criminals, military, Native Americans, federal officials, etc.; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents).
 
 Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because, for example, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects. The Brady law, for example, with its 3,000 words, controls airline baggage, point-of-sale purchases, development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more. Counting it as ""one law"" would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists.
 
 For specifics, I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes; Texas had 226; Arizona 183; Florida 229; and Virginia, in out just released 7th edition, has 193. Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short, wouldn't you agree?
 
 You'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here: gunlaws.com - FAQ
 
 The real question though is this: Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned? The answer to that is no, and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine. New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public, possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one, creating victimless crimes, and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom. That's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance.
 
 Is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for Brookings? It's certainly in your best interests to have accurate information in the public domain with your names attached.","Damn fine job!",2

"546","The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false. The NG is a standing army. The militia is not. The NG can be federalized. The militia can not. They wear the same uniforms. The officers all know each other and play golf together.
 
 If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.","Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.
 
 You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.
 
 The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.",2

"618","Hello everyone, I am a high school student seeking help. Me and my partner are about to enter a debate on firearms, and we already know that we are for guns. Can you all just tell me if you are for guns or not and a short reason why?
 Thank you.","Well, to keep it short, I'll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists. The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:
 
 And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749). 
 
 The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300
 
 There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I'll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.

 False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764
 
 A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)
 
 Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).
 
 Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788
 
 It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)

 If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..
 
 The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.

"40212","The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
Rights Retained by the People
Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.","The purpose of the Bill of Rights.

 Function: noun
 Etymology: Latin, military service, from milit-, miles
 Date: circa 1660
 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country 
 liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens 
 organized for military service 
 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by 
 law as being subject to call to military service 
 
 Ok here is the 2nd amend :
 A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security 
 of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear 
 arms, shall not be infringed. 
 
 Now if you read the definition of militia as a citizen of 
 America I could be called up to serve in one. But no where 
 can the gun haters produce one document stating a 
 requirement to be in a militia to bear arms. 
 
 All gun haters want is to do is put limits on the right to 
 bear arms. Once this limit is on the right to bear arms the 
 gun haters will say now that we have a standing military we 
 no longer need militias. So guess what just happened to the 
 right to bear arms. 
 
 This is why the founding fathers put no limits on our 
 rights. 
 
 This is why the founding fathers describe our rights as the 
 right of the people!

In contrast, truly individual rights such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech do not depend on citizenship. You have those rights because you are an individual or a human being. 
 
 People exercise their right to vote in a government organized election just as people exercise their right to bear arms in a government organized militia.","Actually, the statement bolded above puts Cornell squarely in the ""collective rights"" catagory.

"10182","]The Third Reich did not need gun control (in 1938 or at any time thereafter) to maintain their power. The success of Nazi programs (restoring the economy, dispelling socio-political chaos) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror (the Gestapo) assured the compliance of the German people. Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist. Further, supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion. This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany. Why then did the Nazis introduce this program? As with most of their actions (including the formation of the Third Reich itself), they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power. It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance, as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich. Any direct quotations, of which there are several, that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies.

"49802","The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy.
 
 The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on.
 
 Before the change, verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be. Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP.
 
 Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers. But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program.
 
 There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications.
 
 ""We've identified an issue with [the program],"" said Marty Cheliak, the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program. ""There's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent. In this case, we're looking into that for sure.""
 
 Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle.
 
 Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007. They were initially classified as restricted, based on information from the importer, photos, specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier.
 
 In October 2009, the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment. This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP, which determined the rifles should be prohibited.
 
 ""Why did they make a mistake?"" asked Blair Hagen, president of the National Firearms Association. ""If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place, that has some very serious ramifications.""
 
 In March, the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles, demanding they turn in the guns. This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire.
 
 ""It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [Norinco] which were not reported to us,"" Cheliak said. ""It is very easily converted back to automatic.""
 
 Automatic weapons, even those converted to semi-automatic fire, are prohibited in Canada. Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited.
 
 The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified, and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures.
 
 ""The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it,"" Hagen said.
 
 ""Apparently, they've done a report on this. However, they've refused to release that report. I think what's required here is some transparency.
 
 ""They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community, so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate.""
 
 Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough.
 
 ""Why would we, the RCMP, or any police service give out information to any group &#8230; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic? That's ludicrous.""
 
 Hagen said owners are simply looking for proof. He does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so.
 
 That quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court, where they are questioning the RCMP's ability to reclassify the weapons. Hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification.
 
 However, Cheliak said he doesn't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified, but classified for the first time. A proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm.
 
 Collection of the weapons began in early May. The RCMP say about half of the rifles have been turned in. Those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the Ministry of Public Safety, which is rare.
 
 Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued a written statement supporting the RCMP's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation ""balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners.""
 
 Hagen, of the National Firearms Association, says the RCMP have put the Conservative government, a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners, in an awkward position.
 
 For now, the owners don't feel the government has turned its back on them.
 
 ""However, as this issue progresses, it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government, and I think the minister needs to be prepared for that.""","So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.
 
 Government gets the weapon registered, then they can, at any time and for any reason, demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered.",2

 At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban, and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such. It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban! I don't know if it is being sold as merely a ""common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us,"" but if it is, then here is why that argument is fraudulent: The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW (in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features, while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature. That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban. It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute, but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms. If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference. 
 
 For comparison, here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban:
 
 18 U.S.C. § 921  is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code, and it defines a federally banned AW as follows:
 
 (30) The term ""semiautomatic assault weapon"" means -
 (A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as -
 (i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);
 (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;
 (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);
 (iv) Colt AR-15;
 (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;
 (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;
 (vii) Steyr AUG;
 (viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and
 (ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;
 (B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a bayonet mount;
 (iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and
 (v) a grenade launcher;
 (C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;
 (ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;
 (iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;
 (iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and
 (v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and
 (D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and
 (iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.
 (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)
 [this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns]
 
 Note, by the way, that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired.  What expired was a portion of another statute, which made it a crime to possess these weapons. For reference, that statute is 18 U.S.C. § 922  [which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes. The AW ban added the following language, which has since expired but still exists in the Code]:
 
 (v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) any of the firearms, or replicas or duplicates of the firearms, specified in Appendix A to this section, as such firearms were manufactured on October 1, 1993;
 (B) any firearm that -
 (i) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action;
 (ii) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or
 (iii) is an antique firearm;
 (C) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition; or
 (D) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.
 The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect.
 (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm, of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) This subsection shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (4) If a person charged with violating paragraph (1) asserts that paragraph (1) does not apply to such person because of paragraph (2) or (3), the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph (1) applies to such person. The lack of a serial number as described in section 923(i) of this title shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph (1).",2
"3253","A. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict 
 
 * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 
 * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 
 * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 
 * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of ""Guns in America"" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 
 * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).6 And readers of Newsweek learned that ""only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.""7 
 * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as ""Saturday Night Specials."" 
 B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime
 
 * Nationwide: one-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 
 * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed: 
 * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;10 and 
 * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 
 * Vermont: one of the safest five states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission... without paying a fee... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union -- having three times received the ""Safest State Award.""12 
 * Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average. 14 
 * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. 
 1. During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin. 
 2. And even the 155 ""crimes"" committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas, such as an airport.15 
 C. Criminals avoid armed citizens 
 
 * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.16 
 * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.17 
 * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes: 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and, 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.18 
 Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection 
 * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 
 * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 
 Justice Department study: 
 * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that ""a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.""21 
 * 74% of felons polled agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.""22 
 * 57% of felons polled agreed that ""criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""23

 Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue. His book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate. In fact, this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993. This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. 
 Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, ""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence."" Wolfgang, ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188. 
 Wolfgang says there is no ""contrary evidence."" Indeed, there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study. Even the Clinton Justice Department (through the National Institute of Justice) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year. See National Institute of Justice, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" Research in Brief (May 1997). 
 As for Dr. Kleck, readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. 
 2 According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois.

Cook and Jens Ludwig, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" NIJ Research in Brief (May 1997); available at http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt on the internet. The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study's authors, who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year. Nevertheless, the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures. The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied, and include anti-gun organizations, news media organizations, governments and commercial polling firms.

The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:
 
 And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749). 
 
 The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300
 
 There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I'll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.

 False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764
 
 A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)
 
 Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).
 
 Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788
 
 It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)

 The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.

 I am a photographer, and I photograph mostly landscapes and cityscapes. I have traveled to numerous cities (LA, 'Frisco, NYC, etc.) to photograph its buildings, culture, and people. The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me. In all of these places, I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age. In all three of these cities as in most states, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray. Aren't we the ones who need the most protection? I'm only 16, and I'm a little short and quite skinny. I seriously don't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear, but I don't really have a choice. Some of the most interesting places to photograph are poverty stricken and usually unsafe. With child molesters, rapists, robbers, etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size, wouldn't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged?

 I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors, because those are both deadly weapons and, to be frank, some of my peers are numbskulls.

 They're called ""active shooters"" or ""active killers"" and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes.
 
 After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, police changed their tactics.
 
 The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position.
 
 Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer.
 
 The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene.
 
 They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions.

 I am a photographer, and I photograph mostly landscapes and cityscapes. I have traveled to numerous cities (LA, 'Frisco, NYC, etc.) to photograph its buildings, culture, and people. The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me. In all of these places, I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age. In all three of these cities as in most states, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray. Aren't we the ones who need the most protection? I'm only 16, and I'm a little short and quite skinny. I seriously don't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear, but I don't really have a choice. Some of the most interesting places to photograph are poverty stricken and usually unsafe. With child molesters, rapists, robbers, etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size, wouldn't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged? I don't understand how any state could leave one of their physically weakest minorities so vulnerable.
 
 I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors, because those are both deadly weapons and, to be frank, some of my peers are numbskulls. But, both pepper spray and stun guns have been proven to do no permanent damage to the human body. By the time one is about 15, one is responsible enough to know not to spray someone because ""he gave me a funny look"", ""I don't like him"", or employ its use in a fist fight. If every child molester knew most teenagers were packin non-lethal weapons, do you think he would still attack?

"89022","There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the ""right to keep and bear arms"". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. 
 
 < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea 
 
 < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.","And Hamilton's writings in Federalist 28.

The success of Nazi programs (restoring the economy, dispelling socio-political chaos) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror (the Gestapo) assured the compliance of the German people. Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist. Further, supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion. This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany. Why then did the Nazis introduce this program?

"95122","There have been so many school shootings over the last 40 years that researchers have been able to develop a profile of the typical mass murderer.
 
 They're called ""active shooters"" or ""active killers"" and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes.
 
 After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, police changed their tactics.
 
 The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position.
 
 Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer.
 
 The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene.
 
 They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions.
 
 This technique was employed by police departments around the country.
 
 Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007.
 
 Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people, 30 fatally, in the university's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes.
 
 That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four.
 
 Once again, the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself.
 
 Law enforcement reviewed its tactics.
 
 Based on the Virginia Tech data, experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter.
 
 Every minute the officer waits for back-up, another three or more people could die.
 
 In other words, while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer, it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so.
 
 Tactical Defense Institute in Adams County, Ohio developed one of the first ""single officer response"" programs in the nation.
 
 TDI was teaching the tactic even before Virginia Tech. Now the National School Resource Officer Organization (NSRO) is using TDI instructors to teach school resource officers how to confront a gunman immediately.
 
 Locally, all Blue Ash police officers are trained in these new tactics in large part because their chief, Col. Chris Wallace, is also a TDI instructor.
 
 The other statistic that emerged from a study of active killers is that they almost exclusively seek out ""gun free"" zones for their attacks.
 
 In most states, concealed handguns are prohibited at schools and on college campuses even for those with permits.
 
 Many malls and workplaces also place signs at their entrances prohibiting firearms on the premises.
 
 Now tacticians believe the signs themselves may be an invitation to the active killers.
 
 The psychological profile of a mass murderer indicates he is looking to inflict the most casualties as quickly as possible.
 
 Also, the data show most active killers have no intention of surviving the event.
 
 They may select schools and shopping malls because of the large number of defenseless victims and the virtual guarantee no on the scene one is armed.
 
 As soon as they're confronted by any armed resistance, the shooters typically turn the gun on themselves.","I believe that explains everything very well. ""Gun free zones"" are nothing more than ""sheep for the slaughter"" and ""wholesale massacre"" locations that violent and murderous individuals flock to.",2
"15292","But he said the NRA is also prepared to work with Democrats, as it did in 2007 in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings,....","We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms.

 I am a photographer, and I photograph mostly landscapes and cityscapes. I have traveled to numerous cities (LA, 'Frisco, NYC, etc.) to photograph its buildings, culture, and people. The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me. In all of these places, I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age. In all three of these cities as in most states, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray. Aren't we the ones who need the most protection? I'm only 16, and I'm a little short and quite skinny. I seriously don't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear, but I don't really have a choice.

"4980","The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy.
 
 The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on.
 
 Before the change, verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be. Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP.
 
 Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers. But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program.
 
 There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications.
 
 ""We've identified an issue with [the program],"" said Marty Cheliak, the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program. ""There's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent. In this case, we're looking into that for sure.""
 
 Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle.
 
 Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007. They were initially classified as restricted, based on information from the importer, photos, specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier.
 
 In October 2009, the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment. This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP, which determined the rifles should be prohibited.
 
 ""Why did they make a mistake?"" asked Blair Hagen, president of the National Firearms Association. ""If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place, that has some very serious ramifications.""
 
 In March, the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles, demanding they turn in the guns. This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire.
 
 ""It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [Norinco] which were not reported to us,"" Cheliak said. ""It is very easily converted back to automatic.""
 
 Automatic weapons, even those converted to semi-automatic fire, are prohibited in Canada. Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited.
 
 The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified, and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures.
 
 ""The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it,"" Hagen said.
 
 ""Apparently, they've done a report on this. However, they've refused to release that report. I think what's required here is some transparency.
 
 ""They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community, so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate.""
 
 Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough.
 
 ""Why would we, the RCMP, or any police service give out information to any group &#8230; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic? That's ludicrous.""
 
 Hagen said owners are simply looking for proof. He does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so.
 
 That quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court, where they are questioning the RCMP's ability to reclassify the weapons. Hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification.
 
 However, Cheliak said he doesn't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified, but classified for the first time. A proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm.
 
 Collection of the weapons began in early May. The RCMP say about half of the rifles have been turned in. Those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the Ministry of Public Safety, which is rare.
 
 Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued a written statement supporting the RCMP's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation ""balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners.""
 
 Hagen, of the National Firearms Association, says the RCMP have put the Conservative government, a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners, in an awkward position.
 
 For now, the owners don't feel the government has turned its back on them.
 
 ""However, as this issue progresses, it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government, and I think the minister needs to be prepared for that.""","So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.

 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by 
 law as being subject to call to military service

"89021","There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the ""right to keep and bear arms"". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. 
 
 < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea 
 
 < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.","And Hamilton's writings in Federalist 28.

"4021","The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
Rights Retained by the People
Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.","The purpose of the Bill of Rights.

Quite disturbing if you ask me. To this this suggests that we should look into more tightly regulated medical degrees than anything else.",2
"32532","A. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict 
 
 * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 
 * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 
 * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 
 * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of ""Guns in America"" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 
 * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).6 And readers of Newsweek learned that ""only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.""7 
 * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as ""Saturday Night Specials."" 
 B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime
 
 * Nationwide: one-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 
 * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed: 
 * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;10 and 
 * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 
 * Vermont: one of the safest five states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission... without paying a fee... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union -- having three times received the ""Safest State Award.""12 
 * Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average. 14 
 * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. 
 1. During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin. 
 2. And even the 155 ""crimes"" committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas, such as an airport.15 
 C. Criminals avoid armed citizens 
 
 * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.16 
 * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.17 
 * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes: 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and, 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.18 
 Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection 
 * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 
 * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 
 Justice Department study: 
 * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that ""a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.""21 
 * 74% of felons polled agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.""22 
 * 57% of felons polled agreed that ""criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""23

This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. 
 Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, ""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence."" Wolfgang, ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188. 
 Wolfgang says there is no ""contrary evidence."" Indeed, there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study. Even the Clinton Justice Department (through the National Institute of Justice) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year. See National Institute of Justice, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" Research in Brief (May 1997). 
 As for Dr. Kleck, readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. 
 2 According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois.

Cook and Jens Ludwig, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" NIJ Research in Brief (May 1997); available at http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt on the internet. The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study's authors, who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year. Nevertheless, the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures. The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied, and include anti-gun organizations, news media organizations, governments and commercial polling firms.

"62762","The death toll from fierce street battles in downtown West Kingston has risen to 44 and is expected to climb further as Jamaican security forces continue efforts to flush out the alleged drugs baron Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke.
 
 The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district, scene of the worst fighting.
 
 Witter told local media: ""The police, I gather, have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far. Our own headcount supersedes that. In fact we visited the morgue and were told that no fewer than 35 bodies were lodged there, and most of them were males, mainly young adults."" While at the morgue his team was told of another nine bodies being collected, he said.
 
 At least 37 people are reported to have been injured and the government has appealed for blood donations. In addition 211 people including six women have been detained.
 
 The team was sent in by the Jamaican prime minister, Bruce Golding, following claims of abuse by police and soldiers who stormed the Tivoli Gardens ghetto on Monday in search of Coke, 42, wanted on drug and gun-running charges in the US.
 
 He is still at large, with unconfirmed reports saying he slipped out of Tivoli Gardens on Monday while Jamaican soldiers were engaged in an intense firefight. Civilians have been the main victims during three days of street battles between security forces and gunmen loyal to Coke, the alleged leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang, who have erected barricades of barbed wire and junked cars.
 
 Soldiers have told local media of five-hour gun battles in the streets.
 
 A state of emergency has been declared in the West Kingston area, said to be Coke's stronghold and where he is regarded as a benefactor by many people.
 
 The intensity of the fighting in the heart of the West Kingston slums, which is Golding's own constituency, has taken the government by surprise, the prime minister has admitted. More than 2,000 soliders flooded into the neighbourhood after Jamaica agreed to extradite Coke to the US.
 
 Residents in the no-go area have complained of grenades being thrown by soldiers and of bodies being burned in the streets. Witter said they had seen no evidence of bodies being burned.
 
 Golding told MPs: ""The government deeply regrets the loss of lives, especially those of members of the security services and innocent, law-abiding citizens caught in the crossfire.
 
 ""The security forces were directed to take all practical steps to avoid casualties as much as possible.""
 
 The ""most thorough investigations"" would be undertaken to examine all deaths caused by troops or police, he said. The country's security forces have a reputation for slipshod investigations and being too quick on the trigger.
 
 Security agents would go after ""criminal gunmen in whatever community they may be ensconced"", he said.
 
 Government officials told reporters all the dead civilians in West Kingston were men, but people inside the slums who called local radio stations claimed there had been indiscriminate shooting during the all-out assault by police and soldiers.
 
 Gunmen fighting for Coke describe him as a ""godfather"" figure who helps provide services and protection to the poor West Kingston community. The services and protection are allegedly funded by a criminal empire that seemed untouchable until the US demanded his extradition.
 
 Coke, also known as the President, has built a loyal following and turned the neighbourhood into his stronghold. One placard seen at a barricade read: ""Jesus died for us. We will die for Dudus.""
 
 US authorities claim he has amassed a vast arsenal in his Kingston home turf and has been trafficking cocaine to the streets of New York since the mid-90s, allegedly hiring island women to hide the drugs on themselves on flights to the US.
 
 The UK Foreign Office is advising British nationals to avoid the areas of West Kingston - Tivoli and Denham Town in particular - and Mountain View because of ""substantial unrest including gunfire"".
 
 ""There remains an increased risk of further outbreaks of civil disorder and street violence in Kingston and possibly in other urban centres in Jamaica,"" says the Foreign Office advice.
 
 The Shower Posse, referred to by the FBI as ""the most violent and notorious criminal organisation ever in America"", is believed responsible for more than 1,000 deaths in the US and Jamaica during the cocaine wars of the 1980s.
 
 Earning its name from its ""showering"" of bullets at rivals during gun battles, it operates mainly in Jamaica, the US and Canada. A splinter group called the President Click is known to have operated in the UK - in parts of Brixton in south London known as Little Tivoli.
 
 Former Shower Posse leaders include Coke's father, Lester Coke, who died in a mysterious fire in his prison cell in 1992 while awaiting extradition to the US on drug and murder charges.","44 dead in just one day, in a drug battle. On an island nation no less.

 I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself. 
 
 I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.
 
 For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.

 Thank you.","Well, to keep it short, I'll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists. The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:
 
 And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749). 
 
 The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300
 
 There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I'll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.

 False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764
 
 A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)
 
 Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).
 
 Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788
 
 It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)

 The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.

 Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban.","--------
 
 At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban, and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such. It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban! I don't know if it is being sold as merely a ""common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us,"" but if it is, then here is why that argument is fraudulent: The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW (in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features, while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature. That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban. It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute, but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms. If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference. 
 
 For comparison, here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban:
 
 18 U.S.C. § 921  is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code, and it defines a federally banned AW as follows:
 
 (30) The term ""semiautomatic assault weapon"" means -
 (A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as -
 (i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);
 (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;
 (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);
 (iv) Colt AR-15;
 (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;
 (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;
 (vii) Steyr AUG;
 (viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and
 (ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;
 (B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a bayonet mount;
 (iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and
 (v) a grenade launcher;
 (C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;
 (ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;
 (iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;
 (iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and
 (v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and
 (D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and
 (iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.
 (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)
 [this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns]
 
 Note, by the way, that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired.  What expired was a portion of another statute, which made it a crime to possess these weapons. For reference, that statute is 18 U.S.C. § 922  [which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes. The AW ban added the following language, which has since expired but still exists in the Code]:
 
 (v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) any of the firearms, or replicas or duplicates of the firearms, specified in Appendix A to this section, as such firearms were manufactured on October 1, 1993;
 (B) any firearm that -
 (i) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action;
 (ii) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or
 (iii) is an antique firearm;
 (C) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition; or
 (D) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.
 The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect.
 (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm, of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) This subsection shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (4) If a person charged with violating paragraph (1) asserts that paragraph (1) does not apply to such person because of paragraph (2) or (3), the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph (1) applies to such person. The lack of a serial number as described in section 923(i) of this title shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph (1).",2

 Function: noun
 Etymology: Latin, military service, from milit-, miles
 Date: circa 1660
 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country 
 liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens 
 organized for military service 
 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by 
 law as being subject to call to military service 
 
 Ok here is the 2nd amend :
 A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security 
 of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear 
 arms, shall not be infringed. 
 
 Now if you read the definition of militia as a citizen of 
 America I could be called up to serve in one. But no where 
 can the gun haters produce one document stating a 
 requirement to be in a militia to bear arms. 
 
 All gun haters want is to do is put limits on the right to 
 bear arms. Once this limit is on the right to bear arms the 
 gun haters will say now that we have a standing military we 
 no longer need militias. So guess what just happened to the 
 right to bear arms.

 rights. 
 
 This is why the founding fathers describe our rights as the

Rights Retained by the People
Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.","The purpose of the Bill of Rights.

 The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district, scene of the worst fighting.
 
 Witter told local media: ""The police, I gather, have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far. Our own headcount supersedes that.

Civilians have been the main victims during three days of street battles between security forces and gunmen loyal to Coke, the alleged leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang, who have erected barricades of barbed wire and junked cars.
 
 Soldiers have told local media of five-hour gun battles in the streets.
 
 A state of emergency has been declared in the West Kingston area, said to be Coke's stronghold and where he is regarded as a benefactor by many people.
 
 The intensity of the fighting in the heart of the West Kingston slums, which is Golding's own constituency, has taken the government by surprise, the prime minister has admitted. More than 2,000 soliders flooded into the neighbourhood after Jamaica agreed to extradite Coke to the US.
 
 Residents in the no-go area have complained of grenades being thrown by soldiers and of bodies being burned in the streets. Witter said they had seen no evidence of bodies being burned.
 
 Golding told MPs: ""The government deeply regrets the loss of lives, especially those of members of the security services and innocent, law-abiding citizens caught in the crossfire.
 
 ""The security forces were directed to take all practical steps to avoid casualties as much as possible.""
 
 The ""most thorough investigations"" would be undertaken to examine all deaths caused by troops or police, he said. The country's security forces have a reputation for slipshod investigations and being too quick on the trigger.
 
 Security agents would go after ""criminal gunmen in whatever community they may be ensconced"", he said.
 
 Government officials told reporters all the dead civilians in West Kingston were men, but people inside the slums who called local radio stations claimed there had been indiscriminate shooting during the all-out assault by police and soldiers.
 
 Gunmen fighting for Coke describe him as a ""godfather"" figure who helps provide services and protection to the poor West Kingston community. The services and protection are allegedly funded by a criminal empire that seemed untouchable until the US demanded his extradition.
 
 Coke, also known as the President, has built a loyal following and turned the neighbourhood into his stronghold. One placard seen at a barricade read: ""Jesus died for us. We will die for Dudus.""
 
 US authorities claim he has amassed a vast arsenal in his Kingston home turf and has been trafficking cocaine to the streets of New York since the mid-90s, allegedly hiring island women to hide the drugs on themselves on flights to the US.
 
 The UK Foreign Office is advising British nationals to avoid the areas of West Kingston - Tivoli and Denham Town in particular - and Mountain View because of ""substantial unrest including gunfire"".
 
 ""There remains an increased risk of further outbreaks of civil disorder and street violence in Kingston and possibly in other urban centres in Jamaica,"" says the Foreign Office advice.
 
 The Shower Posse, referred to by the FBI as ""the most violent and notorious criminal organisation ever in America"", is believed responsible for more than 1,000 deaths in the US and Jamaica during the cocaine wars of the 1980s.
 
 Earning its name from its ""showering"" of bullets at rivals during gun battles, it operates mainly in Jamaica, the US and Canada. A splinter group called the President Click is known to have operated in the UK - in parts of Brixton in south London known as Little Tivoli.
 
 Former Shower Posse leaders include Coke's father, Lester Coke, who died in a mysterious fire in his prison cell in 1992 while awaiting extradition to the US on drug and murder charges.","44 dead in just one day, in a drug battle. On an island nation no less.

"8902","There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the ""right to keep and bear arms"". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. 
 
 < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea 
 
 < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.","And Hamilton's writings in Federalist 28.

In contrast, truly individual rights such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech do not depend on citizenship. You have those rights because you are an individual or a human being.

"62761","The death toll from fierce street battles in downtown West Kingston has risen to 44 and is expected to climb further as Jamaican security forces continue efforts to flush out the alleged drugs baron Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke.
 
 The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district, scene of the worst fighting.
 
 Witter told local media: ""The police, I gather, have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far. Our own headcount supersedes that. In fact we visited the morgue and were told that no fewer than 35 bodies were lodged there, and most of them were males, mainly young adults."" While at the morgue his team was told of another nine bodies being collected, he said.
 
 At least 37 people are reported to have been injured and the government has appealed for blood donations. In addition 211 people including six women have been detained.

"49801","The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy.
 
 The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on.
 
 Before the change, verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be. Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP.
 
 Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers. But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program.
 
 There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications.
 
 ""We've identified an issue with [the program],"" said Marty Cheliak, the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program. ""There's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent. In this case, we're looking into that for sure.""
 
 Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle.
 
 Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007. They were initially classified as restricted, based on information from the importer, photos, specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier.
 
 In October 2009, the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment. This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP, which determined the rifles should be prohibited.
 
 ""Why did they make a mistake?"" asked Blair Hagen, president of the National Firearms Association. ""If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place, that has some very serious ramifications.""
 
 In March, the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles, demanding they turn in the guns. This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire.
 
 ""It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [Norinco] which were not reported to us,"" Cheliak said. ""It is very easily converted back to automatic.""
 
 Automatic weapons, even those converted to semi-automatic fire, are prohibited in Canada. Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited.
 
 The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified, and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures.
 
 ""The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it,"" Hagen said.
 
 ""Apparently, they've done a report on this. However, they've refused to release that report. I think what's required here is some transparency.
 
 ""They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community, so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate.""
 
 Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough.
 
 ""Why would we, the RCMP, or any police service give out information to any group &#8230; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic? That's ludicrous.""
 
 Hagen said owners are simply looking for proof. He does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so.
 
 That quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court, where they are questioning the RCMP's ability to reclassify the weapons. Hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification.
 
 However, Cheliak said he doesn't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified, but classified for the first time. A proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm.
 
 Collection of the weapons began in early May. The RCMP say about half of the rifles have been turned in. Those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the Ministry of Public Safety, which is rare.
 
 Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued a written statement supporting the RCMP's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation ""balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners.""
 
 Hagen, of the National Firearms Association, says the RCMP have put the Conservative government, a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners, in an awkward position.
 
 For now, the owners don't feel the government has turned its back on them.
 
 ""However, as this issue progresses, it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government, and I think the minister needs to be prepared for that.""","So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.
 
 Government gets the weapon registered, then they can, at any time and for any reason, demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered.",2

Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent.

You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.
 
 For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.

So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.",2
"32531","A. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict 
 
 * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 
 * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 
 * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 
 * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of ""Guns in America"" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 
 * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).6 And readers of Newsweek learned that ""only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.""7 
 * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as ""Saturday Night Specials."" 
 B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime
 
 * Nationwide: one-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 
 * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed: 
 * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;10 and 
 * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 
 * Vermont: one of the safest five states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission... without paying a fee... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union -- having three times received the ""Safest State Award.""12 
 * Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average. 14 
 * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. 
 1. During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin. 
 2. And even the 155 ""crimes"" committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas, such as an airport.15 
 C. Criminals avoid armed citizens 
 
 * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.16 
 * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.17 
 * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes: 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and, 
 * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.18 
 Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection 
 * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 
 * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 
 Justice Department study: 
 * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that ""a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.""21 
 * 74% of felons polled agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.""22 
 * 57% of felons polled agreed that ""criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""23

 Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue. His book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate. In fact, this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993. This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. 
 Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, ""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence."" Wolfgang, ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188. 
 Wolfgang says there is no ""contrary evidence."" Indeed, there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study. Even the Clinton Justice Department (through the National Institute of Justice) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year. See National Institute of Justice, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" Research in Brief (May 1997). 
 As for Dr. Kleck, readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. 
 2 According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois.

Cook and Jens Ludwig, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" NIJ Research in Brief (May 1997); available at http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt on the internet. The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study's authors, who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year. Nevertheless, the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures. The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied, and include anti-gun organizations, news media organizations, governments and commercial polling firms.

 The purpose of a car is not to kill someone/thing with, it is for transportation. If it is misused, it can kill, but as y'all claim, that applies to anything. The key difference with guns is that the primary and really sole purpose of guns is to kill something with. No one carries them for aeshtitic appeal. Is it true some people carry them for defense? Sure, but its defense on the premise that you can kill someone who attacks you, or at least deter them via threat of death. This isn't to take sides in this debate, I don't want to.

 To Jon S. Vernick; Lisa M. Hepburn
 A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts.
 http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf
 Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect.
 California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law, twice what the federal government has passed.
 
 We publish the gun laws for several states, and distribute books on the subject for 24 states. Our definition for a gun law, while slightly different than yours, is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books.
 
 If it affects private ownership, possession or use of firearms, it is included. A huge list of laws that are not included, which would raise the counts dramatically, is printed in the front of each of our books (e.g., regs for police, criminals, military, Native Americans, federal officials, etc.; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents).
 
 Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because, for example, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects. The Brady law, for example, with its 3,000 words, controls airline baggage, point-of-sale purchases, development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more. Counting it as ""one law"" would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists.
 
 For specifics, I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes; Texas had 226; Arizona 183; Florida 229; and Virginia, in out just released 7th edition, has 193. Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short, wouldn't you agree?
 
 You'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here: gunlaws.com - FAQ
 
 The real question though is this: Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned? The answer to that is no, and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine. New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public, possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one, creating victimless crimes, and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom. That's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance.

"4009","I wonder, how do all the other democracies manage to survive without the protection of a heavily armed citizenry? Does this mean that the found fathers of America realised that they were not to be trusted?","YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.
 
 Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.

 At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban, and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such. It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban! I don't know if it is being sold as merely a ""common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us,"" but if it is, then here is why that argument is fraudulent: The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW (in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features, while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature. That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban. It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute, but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms. If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference. 
 
 For comparison, here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban:
 
 18 U.S.C. § 921  is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code, and it defines a federally banned AW as follows:
 
 (30) The term ""semiautomatic assault weapon"" means -
 (A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as -
 (i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);
 (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;
 (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);
 (iv) Colt AR-15;
 (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;
 (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;
 (vii) Steyr AUG;
 (viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and
 (ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;
 (B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a bayonet mount;
 (iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and
 (v) a grenade launcher;
 (C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -
 (i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;
 (ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;
 (iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;
 (iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and
 (v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and
 (D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of -
 (i) a folding or telescoping stock;
 (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
 (iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and
 (iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.
 (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)
 [this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns]
 
 Note, by the way, that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired.  What expired was a portion of another statute, which made it a crime to possess these weapons. For reference, that statute is 18 U.S.C. § 922  [which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes. The AW ban added the following language, which has since expired but still exists in the Code]:
 
 (v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) any of the firearms, or replicas or duplicates of the firearms, specified in Appendix A to this section, as such firearms were manufactured on October 1, 1993;
 (B) any firearm that -
 (i) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action;
 (ii) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or
 (iii) is an antique firearm;
 (C) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition; or
 (D) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.
 The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect.
 (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm, of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.
 (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.
 (3) This subsection shall not apply to -
 (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);
 (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;
 (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or
 (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.
 (4) If a person charged with violating paragraph (1) asserts that paragraph (1) does not apply to such person because of paragraph (2) or (3), the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph (1) applies to such person. The lack of a serial number as described in section 923(i) of this title shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph (1).",2
"8892","With registration, people have to apply for a licence to own a firearm and in most cases successfully complete a Firearms Safety Course before the licence will be issued. 
 
 With gun registration, the government has the right to deny a person permission to own a gun. This seems to be a direct contradiction of the premise &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221;. Gun owners are worried that total gun registration will eventually lead to the disarming of the people and cite the Nazi disarming of the Jews after gun registration became law in Germany. They also cite examples from Great Britain saying that after gun registration became law, different kinds of guns will gradually be outlawed until no one will be allowed to own a gun of any kind.
 
 No amount of gun registration will effectively wipe out crime in either large cities or rural areas. In Russia, for example, private possession of firearms is illegal, yet there are accounts of mass murders. Modern day serial killers all had guns that were bought through legal channels. Even if gun registration does become law, the government has no idea who owns guns in the country. People who disagree with the law will simply choose not to register their firearm and no one will know anything about it. The fact of trying to get everyone in a country as large as the United States or Canada to register their firearms is a very costly venture and one that will not achieve its objectives.","Gun registration part of the plan all along",2

 Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they ""truly need"" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]","But this is not the end of the story.

 A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts.
 http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf
 Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect.
 California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law, twice what the federal government has passed.
 
 We publish the gun laws for several states, and distribute books on the subject for 24 states. Our definition for a gun law, while slightly different than yours, is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books.
 
 If it affects private ownership, possession or use of firearms, it is included. A huge list of laws that are not included, which would raise the counts dramatically, is printed in the front of each of our books (e.g., regs for police, criminals, military, Native Americans, federal officials, etc.; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents).
 
 Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because, for example, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects. The Brady law, for example, with its 3,000 words, controls airline baggage, point-of-sale purchases, development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more. Counting it as ""one law"" would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists.
 
 For specifics, I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes; Texas had 226; Arizona 183; Florida 229; and Virginia, in out just released 7th edition, has 193. Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short, wouldn't you agree?
 
 You'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here: gunlaws.com - FAQ
 
 The real question though is this: Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned? The answer to that is no, and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine. New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public, possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one, creating victimless crimes, and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom. That's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance.
 
 Is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for Brookings? It's certainly in your best interests to have accurate information in the public domain with your names attached.","Damn fine job!",2
