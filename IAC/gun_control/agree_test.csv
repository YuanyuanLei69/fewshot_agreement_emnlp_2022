 I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:
 
 
 The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
 
 
 
 So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns? 
 
 If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?
 
 Again, thank you for your response.
 
 -Dan","Again that is a poor analogy. Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution. Quite the opposite, it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution.
 
 Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons, in fact it DOES NOT. According to the 10th Amendment:
 
 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.

"822","I am aware of that. I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere.","I agree with you to some extent. First, the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed. Secondly, Virginian law (where the case originates from) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship (that which he was tried and convicted of) and between the agressor.
 
 Quote majority ruling:
 
 A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a ยง922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4-13.
 
 Bulldung.
 
 If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence. How the heck they came up with that is beyond me. They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.
 
 Quote Justice Roberts dissent:
 
 That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under ยง922(g)(9).
 
 ....
 
 The majority also points out that interpreting ""commit-ted by"" to modify the ""use"" of force would render the word""committed"" superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading ""committed by"" to modify ""offense"" has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects ""less-than-meticulous drafting"" and ""syntactical awkwardness,"" and ""is not a model of the careful drafter's art."" Ante, at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.
 
 Which is why this law needs to be rewritten.
 
 There is a lot more, but I find the majority decision hard to believe. It just doesn't make sense (well to me that is.)
 
 BTW, this by no means I support Domestic Violent offenders, etc. On the contrary, I believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence, BUT, this decision is wrong.

"643","Thanks for your input.","Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle. Then consider:
 
 Practice = lots of ammo. 
 Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur.
 Practice = responsible gun owner.
 Training = responsible gun owner.
 Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly.
 Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it.
 Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed.
 
 As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster. When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals, e.g. from behind, up close, in the dark, with suprise, or any combinations of them.
 
 A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself, the implications of comming to the aid of other people, the legal implications of defense on public and private property, etc.
 
 Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know. The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic. You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger, for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop. Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business. My personal decision.
 
 The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin. Not the best tool for you. Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol. So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one.
 
 My personal opinion? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster. Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle, sometimes in your pocket, or sometimes on your hip. Plus a ton of ammo for practice. The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol.
 
 Los of inexpensive, reliable, and well built .38's. Not a lot of fun to shoot, but hey, this is a tool with a very specific purpose. Of course of you can deal with more, by all means upgrade to more. Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon. Most likely you will need it at night, very quickly, and at a little longer than ""knife fighting distances"".
 
 I use a .45 auto. I shoot a full size .45 for fun. Train with the full size .45, but I carry a compact .45. The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45, thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly, it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45. The large .45 has more fun factor, not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day.
 
 Plus I reload the .45 empties. The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought. The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted.
 
 By the end of the day, after carrying even the compact .45. I wish I had a small .38. The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol. He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply. Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil. The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size, shape, and trigger pull.

"1278","I've been thinking this over and I've come to the conclusion that ballistic ""fingerprinting"" is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
 
 As a crime fighting tool and especially a prosecutorial tool, it's worth would be questionable and actually extremely damaging. 
 
 The characteristics recorded; land and grooves (rifling) on the projectile, breech face marks, firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case, could all be corrupted with the expenditure of about 20 minutes of easy work with a small file and/or a new barrel. For some of the more popular handguns, we're talking $20 for a new barrel. 
 
 Imagine the enterprising criminal with an extra $200.00 in his pocket. He could buy replacement barrels for a few of the more popular handguns and have a lucrative swapping out service. He trades out the first barrel and places the one now ""in hand"" in the next gun. No barrels need to be destroyed, all that needs to be done to defeat the system is have discrepancies between original manufacturer's supplied projectile on record for a certain serial number gun and the crime scene recovered projectile. 
 
 ""Lieutenant, this bullet the coroner recovered from Virgil's head goes with serial number xw34t67. The gun we found under Harry's mattress, which we can prove killed Virgil, is number jy57p19.
 
 What good does that do us?""
 
 Realistically, at that point would any further detective manhours be expended trying to figure out how this happened? The barrels were swapped, any evidence as far as ballistic ""fingerprinting"" is concerned, is corrupted. Move on . . .
 
 How about the questions raised for the prosecution if say Harry does go to trial for shooting Virgil with only two marks matching out of four? Let's see, was the ejector swapped out too? Maybe it's reloaded ammo, it's got three ejector marks on it, which firing was incidental to the criminal act?
 
 Another important question; would such a partial, 2 out of 4 or otherwise inconclusive match, (which probably would not be offered as evidence or even admissible in court), be accepted as probable cause for a search or an arrest warrant? 
 
 The next, even more important question is: 
 
 If the bullets (original, supplied by manufacturer and the recovered crime scene bullet) don't match, doesn't that open a Pandora's Box of claims of ""I'm being framed!""??? 
 
 The defendant could claim that it was the police, not him, that swapped barrels. 
 
 Harry says,"" the cops got a sample bullet from my gun and the bullet that done killed Virgil don't match! They put a different barrel in my gun that matches the bullet they said was in Virgil's noggin"" 
 
 The state would be providing four pieces of potentially ironclad exculpatory evidence for the defendant! (again, land and grooves on the projectile and breech face marks, firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case) 
 
 The defense will of course enter into evidence a STATE SEALED document attesting that the following data represents the official --exclude all others -- ""ballistic fingerprint"" for Harry's gun, S/N-jy57p19. The problem for the authorities is, while they can prove that Harry's gun killed Virgil, (using standard forensic ballistics) that fact does not matter anymore because the crime scene bullet, the one in Virgil's noggin, matches a different gun, not placed in evidence by the prosecution and nowhere to be found . . . 
 
 This would create a new level to the prosecutor's burden of proof, now he has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that THIS defendant also swapped the barrel and corrupted other ""fingerprints"" for his weapon in addition to actually firing the weapon that killed the victim. 
 
 I think that more times than not, this will be an impossible additional hurdle to jump and the outcome of that will be allot of criminals will go free.
 
 This ""new"" science of ballistic ""fingerprinting"" would in essence destroy the well established and deserved good reputation of forensic ballistics. I think this proposal will work directly against law enforcement and in the end, help criminals.
 
 Debate questions:
 
 Does this ballistic fingerprint proposal, with all the inherent questions it raises, realistically help or hurt the police and prosecutors? Does it increase or lessen the hours needed to solidify a case? 
 
 Can anyone prove to me that criminals will not go free using a corrupted ballistic ""fingerprint"" as their legal leverage?","That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.
 
 In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment. This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission.

 From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of ""my God what are they doing!"" panic you hear when someone passes a law they don't like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:
 
 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.
 There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.
 A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.
 
 In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the ""wild, wild west,"" ""traffic accidents becoming shootouts,"" and Fla. becoming the ""gunshine state."" These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law. I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then.",1.4,2

However, since implementation of the Brady Law in February 1994, there has been a significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes committed with a firearm. A study by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence showed that, since it's enactment, the Brady Law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day.

 So a sex offender rapes a 57 year old woman, and five days later he comes back, cuts her electricity, and she shoots him with a shotgun and kills him. She doesn't face any charges for her actions. I consider that justice served.","I agree, but the libs would weep and call her a murderer. I suppose they'd rather have her submit to this vile person. They support pacifism, and in New York, she'd be in prison. Good thing people in my area have common sense.",2,2

 Well a lot of good that advice is gonna do these South Carolina people, now that the police have been ordered not to pursue criminals who run from the scene of a crime. If they start hopping fences then the police can't pursue in their squad cars, and they can't get out to chase after them either.
 
 So...even before, the courts have stated explicitly that the job of the police is not to protect anyone, and now we have mayors ordering the police to not apprehend fleeing criminals. This means that those townspeople are gonna need to rely on themselves. And if the gun control laws are liberal and excessively strict, they're SOL. Innocent people are gonna get getting killed because of this new policy.","Poor guys they are so screwed.
 
 We get it all the time here in Australia, dont fight back just call the cops, who may be there in 35 minutes as the average response time!!
