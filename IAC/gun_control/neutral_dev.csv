"4990","DALLAS (AP) - A shootout outside a north Dallas bank has left at least two people wounded and customers and employees locked in the bank's vault.
 
 The shooting happened just before 11 a.m. outside the United Texas Bank. The bank is located on the first floor of the Four Forest high-rise office building, near the intersection of U.S. 75 and Interstate 635 at 12221 Merit.
 
 A Dallas Police spokesman says that it was a targeted shooting and not a random act. Two men, father and son, were the gunman's victims. Both have been taken to a hospital and are in stable condition. The gunman was shot in an altercation with police. His condition is not known at this time.
 
 A witness tells KRLD-AM of Dallas that a bank customer went outside, then came back inside and said, ""You'd better lock your doors."" Another witness reported seeing a man sitting in a chair with blood all over his chest.","BREAKING NEWS: SHOOTING IN DALLAS OFFICE TOWER - CTnow

"2884","asahi.com????????Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - English
 
 OTSU, Shiga Prefecture--Given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?
 
 The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but TV networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.
 
 The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co. Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.
 
 Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.
 
 Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.
 
 So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.
 
 Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually ""possess"" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.
 
 Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.
 
 The show, called ""Tokimeki Shiga'S,"" is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.
 
 The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,""Do you want to hold it?""
 
 Harada held the rifle and commented, ""It's heavy, isn't it?"" adding, ""Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?""
 
 He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.
 
 Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.
 
 The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.
 
 The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.
 The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations.
 
 ""I never could have imagined anything like this,"" Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. ""I was stunned.""
 
 Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions.
 
 ""We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,"" he said.
 
 A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police.
 
 ""They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,"" a spokesperson said. ""From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.""
 
 An employee at another TV station was also critical.
 
 ""If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?"" the employee asked. ""Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.""
 
 But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.
 
 A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of ""storage and management.""
 
 An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.
 
 The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.
 
 The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.
 
 ""I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said.
 
 According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.
 
 A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.
 
 The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.
 
 By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.
 
 They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?
 
 Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far.
 
 ""The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,"" he said. ""They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.""
 
 But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.
 
 ""The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.""
 
 Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.
 
 Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: ""The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'"" he said. ""There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).""
 
 Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.
 
 ""When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,"" he said. ""It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.""(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)
 
 Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you? If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.

"9985","Assault weapons? first of all, what are assault weapons? Traditionally, it has meant a selective fire weapon (one capable of full, burst, and semi-automatic fire.) According to current legal definition, though, a semiautomatic weapon (one that fires a single round with every time you pull the trigger) can be legally called an assault weapon if it has 1) a removeable magazine, and any 2 of the following: 
 
 a grenade launcher
 a bayonet lug
 a pistol grip
 or a folding stock. 
 
 How is that an assault weapon?? I have no idea! why are they worried about semi-autos with pistol grips and folding stocks? Again, I have no idea. 
 
 However, we'll assume for the moment that we are talking about a traditional assault rifle: a selective fire weapon along the lines of the FN FAL, the M16, AK-47, etc. 
 Constitutionally, it doesn't even really matter. In the United States Constitution, we are guaranteed in the 2nd Amendment that:
 
 ""... the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""
 
 There's a key word there. ""Infringed."" What does that word infringed mean? Webster's 1828 Dictionary defines it like this: 
 
 2. To break; to violate; to transgress; to neglect to fulfill or obey; as to infringe the law.
 3. to destroy or hinder; as, to infringe efficacy.
 
 Under this definition, the right to own a firearm cannot even be hindered! Forget banning handguns. Forget banning assault weapons. The registration of firearms might not survive a Constitutional attack. 
 
 So. It is UNCONSTITUTIONAL to ban assault weapons. (despite the fact that we basically have already done that.)","Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.
 
 Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.
 
 First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.
 
 However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the ""dangerous"" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.
 
 Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.
 
 What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.
 
 A common remark is ""why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?"" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.
 
 Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own. 
 
 I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.

 Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement?

 So if you're really interested in enforcing gun laws, don't support the NRA.","""What is true, Ricker says, is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals, and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. ""
 
 The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity.
 
 GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.
 
 Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.
 
 There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity.

 -Lewis v. United States (US Supreme Court 1980) - VOR
 
 
 Lewis vs. United States:
 
 It is about a felon who wants to carry a gun. The decision clearly says felons can not own firearms.
 
 ""In 1961, petitioner George Calvin Lewis, Jr., upon his plea of guilty, was convicted in a Florida state court of a felony [445 U.S. 55, 57] for breaking and entering with intent to commit a misdemeanor. See Fla. Stat. 810.05 (1961). He served a term of imprisonment. That conviction has never been overturned, nor has petitioner ever received a qualifying pardon or permission from the Secretary of the Treasury to possess a firearm. See 18 U.S.C. App. 1203 (2) and 18 U.S.C. 925 (c). 
 
 In January 1977, Lewis, on probable cause, was arrested in Virginia, and later was charged by indictment with having knowingly received and possessed at that time a specified firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. 1202 (a) (1). [...]""

 ""F. Myth #6: The Second Amendment militia is the National Guard. 
 
 The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large. Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia. 
 
 1. Founding Fathers 
 * George Mason: ""I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.""145 
 
 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): ""That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...."" 
 
 * Richard Henry Lee: ""To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.""146 
 
 2. U.S. Congress 
 
 * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated: 
 
 ""Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints....""147 
 The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard. 
 
 * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). ""In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard.""148 
 
 * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C. Sec. 311. ""The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and... under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States....""149 
 
 3. Supreme Court: U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, ""The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.""150 ""
