 JOE HORN, TEXAS RESIDENT: They just stole something. I'm going after them, I'm sorry.
 
 911 OPERATOR: Don't go outside. 
 
 JOE HORN, TEXAS RESIDENT: I ain't letting them get away with this s--t. They stole something. They got a bag of something.
 
 911 OPERATOR: Mr. Horn, do not go outside the house. 
 
 JOE HORN, TEXAS RESIDENT: I'm sorry. This ain't right, buddy.
 
 911 OPERATOR: You're going to get yourself shot if you go outside that house with a gun. I don't care what you think.
 
 HORN: You want to make a bet? I'm going to kill them.
 
 911 OPERATOR: OK? Stay in the house.
 
 HORN: They're getting away.
 
 Joe Horn took his shotgun, went out to confront the burglars as they were leaving his neighbor's house, and shot both to death. 
 
 In an interesting twist, weeks after the shooting, the Pasadena police department revealed that, unbeknownst to Joe Horn. ""... a plainclothes Pasadena detective witnessed the Nov. 14 shootings after he pulled up in an unmarked car seconds before Horn fired three shots from his 12-gauge shotgun. Corbett said the plainclothes detective, whose name has not been released, had parked in front of Horn's house in response to the 911 call. He saw the men between Horn's house and his neighbor's before they crossed into Horn's front yard. 
 
 According to the Chronicle: ""Corbett believes neither Horn nor the men knew a police officer was present. 'It was over within seconds. The detective never had time to say anything before the shots were fired,' Corbett said. 'At first, the officer was assessing the situation. Then he was worried Horn might mistake him for the `wheel man' (get-away driver). He ducked at one point.' ""
 
 And Horn didnt go to jail thanks to those right to kill laws or castle laws that the NRA supports!","Good shooting! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again.

 UT's athletic director, Mike Hamilton, said that under the new policy, the university will automatically dismiss any student-athlete found in possession of a gun - even those with permits and even those living off-campus. This over-reaching policy prevents law-abiding UT student-athletes from hunting and engaging in recreational and competitive shooting. More importantly, it also prohibits them from owning a firearm for self-defense, a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
 
 Let's be very clear - anyone, student-athlete or otherwise, who commits a serious crime ought to be punished. But the law-abiding should not, period.

 The injustice of the British ban on self defense
 
 Making matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:
 
 Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he ""has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars."" Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.
 
 Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:
 
 A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home - while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve ""civilised society"". But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his ""public duty"" to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.

The sensationalist way in which he tackles the subject matter is possibly undermining any social message he is trying to get across.","I agree. I wouldn't have minded Bowling so much if he had either made a documentary or made a commercial film. In the end, the message wasn't that bad. For all intenst and purposes he said exactly what the pr-gunners have been saying for years, which is that guns don't kill, people kill. 
 
 Now, he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there, but that was more or less the conclusion of the film. Our society is a messed up place and people are scared. I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be (just look at our crime statistics).
 
 Watching the film, it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another. The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was ""guns are evil"". It wasn't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not ""guns are evil"".
