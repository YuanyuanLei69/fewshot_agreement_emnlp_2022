"1119","I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.","I think pro-gun extremists' stubborn and uncompromising opposition to even small amounts of gun control appears unreasonable to a lot of people and turns people against them. The pro-gun side plays a role in creating their own enemies. One example of this happening is the case of Sarah Brady. In her own words:
 
 ""Dorothy and the manager of the company stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that [we] would go swimming. Scott got in first, and I climbed in behind him. He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun and started waving it around. I took [it] from him, intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone. As soon as I got it into my hand, I realized it was no toy. It was a fully loaded little Saturday night special, very much like the one that had shot Jim.
 
 ""I cannot even begin to describe the rage that went through me. To think that my precious little boy, 6 years old, had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge. I handed the gun to Dorothy. I didn't want to see it again, I said-get rid of it. The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members. I didn't reply.
 
 ""Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer, which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968.
 
 ""Instantly, all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back. I knew the 1968 law well. It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers, imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I said, 'My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you out of business.' ""

"5613","WASHINGTON -- New Jersey's U.S. senators plan to introduce a bill that would make it illegal for anyone, except a police officer or military official, to purchase or use an assault pistol that fires bullets capable of penetrating a bulletproof vest. 
 
 The Five-SeveN gun made by FN Herstal of Belgium has already been denounced by three national police organizations and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The handgun is small and lightweight and easily concealed in a person's","It looks like the anti gunners are at it again, only now they have a new target. 
 
 For those who do not follow such things, the FN five seven fires a new round, the 5.7x28. There are 2 versions of the round availabe, one is an aluminum base, steel core, FMJ round designed to pierce body armor. It is not available to civilians int he US, it is law enforcement only. The other round avaliable IS a civilian round, it is a hollowpoint which has already been cleared by the ATF as a non armor piercing round.
 
 The civilian round (the non AP one) WILL pierce body armor, as will a .22 magnum, and most solid point .22 LR rounds. Body armor is specifically designed to take the implact from large, slow moving rounds, not small, fast rounds.
 
 I am also a little confused as to what makes this an ""assault pistol"". I have 2 of them. I purchsed them specifically because when the civilian version came out, I fully expected that thet antigunners would pitch a fit and we would see attempts to ban the weapon, which would boost the value of them. They pretty much look like a glock. Why is the five seven an ""assault pistol"" and the glock is not? 
 
 While I am sure we are all used to GG's pushing for bans that have no basis in reality, even I was a little surprised that they moved so quickly on this one.
 
 
 
 Now, my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds. If you want a REALLY good AP round, get a 7.62x25 (tokarev). You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ($200 or less for a good makarov). Hand load your rounds, but instead of using the 7.62, order some .30 sabots. You can get them from a bunch of places (just do a search for "".30 sabot"" on google). They cost about $10 for 100 of them. Load your 7.62x25 with a fast burning powder, and you can load a heavier powder load. Use a .223 speer FMJ.
 
 Our experiments (we experimented with this at work when we were working on a contract related to ceramic body armor) showed that this will go through TWO kevlar vests and 16 inched of ballistics gel, which implies rather heavily that you can reasonably expect to shoot right through 2 police officers using the round, vest or no.

"4139","The fear on the street is palpable. Ever since the election of Barack Obama as President of these United States in November 2008, coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the U.S. House and Senate, concern for the United States and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass.
 
 <snip<
 
 What is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there, but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source: street cops.
 
 Street cops and SWAT cops that I know from various agencies - rural, suburban and metro - in my area are scared. Cops that before November 2008 never gave much thought (that I knew of anyway) to politics or more importantly to gun rights. For the most part, these are the guys that didn't generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is, and a few of them didn't even do that so well.
 
 The guys I am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis- but not anymore. They don't scare easily, defenders of the Constitution of this State and the United States (as our oath of office reads), have been buying ARs, survival gear, and all the ammo they can lay their hands on. All of them (or I should say ""us"") have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense.
 
 What are we suddenly so afraid of? Well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas...
 
 First, fear of federal government intrusion into our lives. Every time I look at or listen to the news, there is something new and intrusive coming out of the Obama administration and this Congress. New tax schemes, government-run Canadian-style healthcare, a volunteer citizen defense force (whatever that is, what happened to the National Guard?) equipped with funding similar to our military, forced voluntary ""service"" after retirement, a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border, the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held Chrysler and GM dealerships, which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on.
 
 But these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg. We can't see the full impact of these actions yet, but we don't know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet. I predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect, a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed.
 
 What also scares us is the second, well-founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming, one that would make the Clinton Ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison. I remember well the 1990s and the Clinton years: the rise of militia groups, the ""black helicopter"" rumors and paranoia, all of which was motivated by the Brady Law and the Assault Weapon's ban. What if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn-in of banned weapons as what happened in Australia?
 
 ...I foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road. Americans are citizens, and not subjects like the British, Canadians or Australians. They just don't always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that I spoke to said anything like ""I hope I get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned; They are fun to shoot, so I would hate to give it up."" It isn't going to happen, so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down. I think you all get what I am saying here.
 
 Which leads me to the third fear, that there is a revolution coming, yes, a revolution on the scale of the original American Revolution. You can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts. The possibility of an armed revolution against the U.S. government being discussed, albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided, which it is. I never heard this mentioned in the 90s. One of my quietest, low profile officer friends brought it up the other day.
 
 He said that at some point in the near future, he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are. Something has got to give. I was shocked. Yes, I had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past, but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented. Now, these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution, preach sedition or to even participate. They just want to be ready if it happens, to at least defend their families, because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos.
 
 Cops fear for their parents, wives, children or grandchildren more now than ever before. Most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits. Not only that, but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an AR in the family ride at the ready all the time. They are also strapping on heavier forms of off-duty hardware. I have other friends that are issued ARs or subguns for tactical team use, who always have their gear with them and are planning on just commandeering these weapons for personal use in defending hearth and home.

"6740","So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality, a decline in the number of gun laws, and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns?","Why? Because people like you are still pushing gun bans regardless of the Heller ruling!
 
 It doesn't help your side's argument when your people continually talk about ""reasonable"" and ""common sense gun regulations"" and their examples include bans on ""assault weapons"", semi-automatic firearms, ""armor piercing ammunition"", ""high capacity magazines"", waiting periods, mental health evaluations, fingerprinting and photographing of gun owners, permits, nationwide registration, etc.
 
 DC is a fine example of this. After Heller dissolved their gun laws they basically said ""Fine! If it can't be 100% impossible to get a gun in DC then we'll make it 99.9999999% impossible!"" They did this through the enactment of so-called ""emergency legislation"" which violates the Heller ruling in every conceivable way. DC even sold out their home rule to California in the sake of having gun control. Don't you dare forget that DC denied a woman the ability to register her legally owned handgun because it's color scheme wasn't on a list of approved firearms.
 
 People like you are continually demanding that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition be banned, saying that nobody has a legal use for them and they're used exclusively for killing large groups of people, or turning animals into meat paste. Yet at the same time you claim that ""Saturday Night Specials"" as you call them, are the preferred choice of criminals, and yet not one of these ""Saturday Night Specials"" is capable of holding more than 7 rounds of ammunition in their magazine.
 
 People like you continually talk about gun violence, but your answer to the question always involves more laws that only affect the law-abiding. This suggests that you're either too stupid to live, or you have an absolute distrust of anyone who isn't a government working dog. Which is it that you fit into, stupid or paranoid?

 FBI Special Agent John Shipley has been indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in El Paso, Texas for buying and selling firearms without a license. What the government does not understand is that the personal sale of a firearm is NOT illegal. The Federal Firearms Regulations Reference Guide clearly states that a &#8220;Dealer is defined as: &#8220;(c) Dealer in firearms other than a gunsmith or a pawnbroker. A person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such a term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.&#8221;  Since John&#8217;s livelihood is as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) his life is dedicated to upholding and enforcing the laws of the United States of America. His grandparents sparked his interest in firearms and had even contributed to his collection. But after qualifying for a SWAT team and becoming a sniper for the FBI, his interests and guns began to more closely line up with his needs and wants to become a firearms instructor for the FBI.
 
 In most cases, a crime is committed and justice searches for the person that committed the crime. But in this case, justice has found a person and they are searching for a crime to pin upon him. Having a personal collection of firearms, ammunition, and related items is NOT Illegal. Reading firearms magazines, belonging to a gun club and frequently going to the firing range is also NOT Illegal. Buying and selling guns to improve or enhance a personal collection or to even liquidate a part or all of a collection is NOT Illegal. So why is John Shipley being accused of selling firearms without a license, when a license is not required?

"1267","I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the ""it's not in the Constitution"" position. This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights.
Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void, not liberty.
Scalia's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS's application of the Amendment in prior cases. Heller neither stated or established anything new; there never was a ""state"" or ""collective"" right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable, claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection.
I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS's prior holdings that the right is not created, granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I'll never know or understand.
Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it.
In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's ""prenumbra"" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:
""Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `libertyÂ´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'""
Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)""Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects.

Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .
Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.","That's questionable. In Casey, Scalia pointed out,
""But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better. If, indeed, the 'liberties' protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours.""
Arguably, the language of the Second Amendment is ambiguous. Thus decades of controversy about its true meaning. But in Heller, Scalia decides that the court, not the people, should clarify such text.",-0.8,1

 Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.
 
 There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety.

"5021","ABC aired a special on the effectiveness of CCW on campus. They had a student take a concealed weapons class (who had never fired a gun before).
 
 After the class, they put him in a classroom with 20 or so people dressed in protective gear and face shields. They armed him with a simunition pistol (a pistol that fires non-lethal rubber projectiles used for training). 
 
 In the middle of a simulated college ""instruction period"", a police SWAT team member charged in and started shooting.
 
 This was to conduct an ""experiment"" to see if students carrying concealed weapons was an effective means of stopping a mass killer.
 
 Guess what happened?
 
 When the ""shooter"" busted into the classroom, the armed ""student"" immediately went for his gun, got it tangled in his shirt tail, and was shot with a simunition round.
 
 The conclusion reached by ABC and ""proven"" was that CCW was ineffective in a mass shooting scenario.

"8047","""The Mexican Ambassador to the United States, Auturo Sarukhan, appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico. The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because ""most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States."" That is not true, but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda. 
 
 ATFE's Fake Number
 
 We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has made so many contradictory statements on the matter. ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90% of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US. 
 
 The problem is that 90% number isn't true. Yet, that hasn't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, of course, Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico's problems. 
 Real Weapons Source?
 
 The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now ""clarified"" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. 
 
 We can easily understand Mexico's reasons for preferring the 90% number to the more accurate 17%. Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels. Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police. Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from purchases in Eastern Europe. But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government's failure to police its borders, its ports of entry and its military installations. 
 
 Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels? 
 
 Lax Vehicle Inspection 
 
 Certainly, no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance. You can't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona. But for the sake of argument, what if it was true that 30% of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S.? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S.? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections. And could it be that Mexico's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun-smuggling operations? 
 
 Why Strange Obama Response? 
 
 But what accounts for the Obama administration's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence? Two explanations are possible: It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem. If we can end Mexico's chaos by making changes on this side of the border, that's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage. 
 
 The other explanation is more troublesome. Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself. It is obvious that Obama's teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans. The Obama crew's hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months. This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel's maxim: ""Never let a good crisis go to waste."" 
 
 Mexico needs to face its own demons, beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry. The U.S. can help in many ways, such as enhancing our own border security. But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico. 
 
 If we are lucky, this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction. If it is more than that, if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico's problems, then we are lost in a swamp. ""","If Obama and his admin.really believes it,or as you say use it for their own agenda(not quote unquote).then maybe we are lost in a swamp.A swamp on the eve of 1861.Oh by the way did anyone mention which corner gun store or gun show(can't forget the gun show now)

 For example, most of the states listed with high gun crime, and gun control laws, have cities that alone rival the population of the states with low gun crime, and less gun restrictions.
 
 And that may be part of the problem. Population density may well have some consideration here. It may be a lot easier, for example, for someone to commit multiple armed robberies in a given period of time in say someplace like NYC, than it would be in a rural state like Vermont or Montana. this in turn, would more naturally increase the chances of someone being shot, because of not giving up their wallet, or attempting to resist in saome other manner.

"6784","As I understand, the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny. The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past. The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military. However, because of big advances in military technology it's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces. What use would a handgun be against a tank or F-16 Fighter plane? 
 I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about. We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision. They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms. Thus, the Supreme Court chose to ""strain at a gnat and swallow a camel"" to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment.","First, you wouldn't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane. It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most ""living document"" people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more.

 -- Asia. According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report, China has provided arms to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico.
 
 -- The Mexican Army. More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years, according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo. Many took their weapons with them, including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium.
 
 -- Guatemala. U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants, stolen cars, guns and drugs, including most of America's cocaine, along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border. On March 27, La Hora, a Guatemalan newspaper, reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border. Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan, a border town.","And NOW we find out that Mexico's overall per capita crime rate is less than countries like the UK, Canada and ours?

"4373","People have claimed that owning a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Well, there is the risk of suicide, but I'm talking sane people here. So how would owning a firearm make the owner more likely to be shot? How would it make him more likely to be killed?","Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. 
 
 Run a google search for ""man shoots self"" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though.",-0.833333333333,1
"9666","At least two Metropolitan Police Department units from the nearby District of Columbia were already at the scene when they arrived. Why? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPD's Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters' buses to Baer's home.
 
 Still, the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods.
 
 The Maryland officers reported there were approximately 500 protesters on and near the front lawn of Baer's house. 
 
 The primary role of the Washington cops in this event was to protect the protesters.","Why do 14 bus loads, 500 SCIU members, need 2 Police squad cars from DC to protect them from 1 Home owner? 
 
 Fishy? I don't think so! I think the COPS were there to Intimidate the one home owner, just like SEIU was there to do! Cops! Of all things, they used Washington DC COPS! Cops! 
 
 No? What am I missing?
 
 Makes one wonder if things got out of hand and the protesters started throwing rocks through the window, and if the terrified home owner would have stepped out with a fire arm, am I wrong to think that the DC police would have shot the home owner? Seriously What the heck gives? Cops! Part of the angry mob?
 
 If nothing else, 500 people trashed this guys lawn! That is for sure.
 
 Am I missing something here, or am I correct to think that we have totally degenerated into Chicago style intimidation politics? See the video for reasons why I believe this.",-0.6,1

 Michigan adopted a shall-issue system three years ago and the Wild West still hasn't gotten here.

Why do you constantly try and oversimplify things by claiming that gun control will work, while at the same time not discussing matters relating to income, surroundings, upbringing, recidivism rates, prison sentences and other such matters?","Given that this is the gun control forum, it seems logical to focus on gun control rather than other factors relevant to the crime rate. This is just a slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position.",-0.428571428571,1
"8597","But felons can't vote and I don't see that in the Constitution, either. 
 I don't have a problem with preventing criminals from legally owning firearms. That said, I think it's against our rights to be assumed to be a criminal without ever being convicted of a crime.","Thats a rather shaky argument. In some place felons do vote. Our own fast eddie has them getting signed up while in prison. If you take a right and question it, then it is no longer a right. It has become a defacto privilige. If it was up to me, criminals would have their own sanctuary away from the law abiding after they serve their time.",-0.5,1

"2447","Maybe if there was a gun culture in the UK the police would have been more used to dealing with gun rampages.
 Maybe if everyone in the UK owned a gun then someone would have shot this man before he killed so many people. I dont know but I do know that the solution to stopping this happening again does not lie in making guns easier to get!
 
 The USA can have as many guns as it wants but to allow Brits to obtain guns as easy as they can it the States would be madness.","Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime, UK - The Independent",-0.142857142857,1
"7453","And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.
 
 Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!","While it's true that criminals won't be lining up to register guns that they already own, gun registration could make it harder for them to obtain more guns in the future. Registration could require law abiding citizens to be more careful about who they sell their guns to as well as making it easier to trace back a lost or stolen gun to the original owner.",-0.4,1
