"5546","Licensing systems are very expensive to administer. Canada's experience with its full licensing and registration system, begun in December 1998, is not encouraging. The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $185 million [Canadian] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $85 million [Canadian]. But, by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $327 million [Canadian] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government's original forecast. The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country's earlier gun control system, only 142,000 new licenses had been issued. Using these figures as a baseline for America's arsenal of 65 million handguns, the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering.
 
 Most importantly, licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence, such as unintentional gunshot deaths, suicides and the majority of homicides, since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally.
 
 From a political perspective, a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray. The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners. In contrast, health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers. 
 
 Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration: we register automobiles and license drivers, so why not guns? However, licensing and registration-the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation-had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury. It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s, and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment, that decreases were seen.","Canada's registry has had horrific problems, only registering 3/4ths of their 7 million guns, and has been hacked more times than Lizzie Borden's parents!

 Why would one assume that the civics rights model, which demands exclusivity, is to be favored over the standard model which does not ? Note that the standard model encompasses a right to keep and bear arms for one's own defense as well as to contribute to the common defense so is consistent with various statements from that time (i.e. see Bryan's non-exhaustive list of citations from that era).

However, I do ask again that you at least consdier the following, presented by the Center for Gun Policy and Research, part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. (Link on an above post.)
 
 
 ...the costs of creating, maintaining, and using a federal system are likely to be substantial. The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day-almost 29,000 per year-are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence- by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth-the investment will be well worth it.
 
 
 Also,
 
 -In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion.
 - Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public.
 -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million.
 -Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs.
 -The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per year
 
 
 Like I have, said, it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done, to figure out precisely what the program will cost, and how how effective it would be.

 Also, the whole ""school shooting"" business in the US is not really any sort of major problem. The thing is, the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is.
 
 As far as uses for a gun: In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour, or even longer, to respond. People in that situation cannot rely on police protection. In addition, our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens. Instead, our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur.
 
 People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports. Hunting, trap and skeet, and target shooting are important parts of American culture. In fact, our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost, to US citizens.

The government does nothing of that sort, the Bill of Rights as a document declares that government is FORBIDEN to grab power over the issuses and rights mentioned in the Bill of Rights.","Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago, but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now.
 
 Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety, so that we don't live in a state of anarchy, where the biggest strongest man wins. If a power isn't given to the government, they may not use it. The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation. To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it, and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to (it doesn't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government). The 2nd amendment is restricting the government (federal, states, and local governments) from infringing upon that right. But the question still arises, what is meant by the mysterious militia clause?
 
 There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution. But then an even bigger problem arises. If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has. But I really don't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such. This is really a problem. Also, obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution, wouldn't concealed weapons also be covered? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment.
 
 Many will use the quote ""Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither"", but this is a hollow argument. The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties (the liberty to kill someone) for personal safety and protection of our other rights (the right to life). I agree you cannot go too far, but where do we draw the line? I don't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals, so that instead of handguns and regular bombs, they are using uzies and atomic bombs? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public? That's a hard question to answer because I don't have much trust in either one, therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line.

"3537","Fundamental Rights
This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.","And here our Government recognizes:

 The 4-3 vote sent the legislation carried by Assemblywoman Lori Saldaña, D-San Diego, to the Appropriations Committee and likely on to the Senate floor where the final outcome is in doubt, particularly in this election-year atmosphere.
 
 The measure has passed the Assembly earlier this month.
 
 California law currently allows unloaded handguns to be carried in public.
 
 Saldaña's measure, Assembly Bill 1934, is supported by a statewide police chief's organization and major gun-control groups.
 
 They argue that police are being required to respond to reports of guns, draining resources and creating dangerous situations because authorities have to assume the guns are loaded.
 
 This ""open carry movement"" goes ""beyond what's safe and what's responsible,"" Saldaña said.
 
 Emeryville Police Chief Ken James added, ""Open carry is not just a threat to public safety, it's a threat to officers.""
 
 Several opponents of the measure countered that they have a constitutional right to bear arms and noted that there have been no police problems directly associated with someone carrying an unloaded weapon in plain sight.
 
 Some also contend the legislation would make criminals out of hunters, campers and others who take their weapons along for protection and target shooting.
 
 Sen. Rod Wright, D-Inglewood, and a gun owner, defended the right to carry weapons in public as long as they are unloaded.
 
 Responding to complaints that the guns intimidate and make people uncomfortable, Wright said he has a tall friend with tattoos who intimidates and makes people uncomfortable.
 
 ""Are we going to ban him next?"" Wright asked as he voted against the bill.
 
 But Sen. Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, said that it is too dangerous to allow ""gang-bangers"" to openly tote weapons.
 
 ""There are Second Amendment rights,"" he said. ""There are also Second Amendment responsibilities,"" Cedillo said.","So law-abiding citizens are being considered gang-bangers in California?

"860","Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.
 
 One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.
 
 Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.
 
 The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.
 
 Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.
 
 The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.
 
 These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.
 
 This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.
 
 But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.
 
 For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.","So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's ""weak gun control laws"" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?

This is no different than a person putting up a sign showing what security system is protecting there home even if they don't have a security system. It is the poor mans security system. So since we are on the topic of using signs to encourage or discourage violence, wouldn't you agree you can play on criminal's fear of guns without actually owning a gun? I would say that you can.","You just proved the DETERANCE of a gun on crime, The deterance of SOME people Carriing concealed... Just like your poor mans sign. Do you get it?

People would reconsider when they are looking at that kind of penalty. I take the opposite view as you , thoug, I think this would simply encourage them to carry bigger, badder guns. If you are looking at life for robbing a bank, you may as well use a rocket launcher and an M-60 as use a handgun. This would virtually ensure that the police would not get you, as most police departments on the planet are not equipped to deal with heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. If hte penalty is the same though, why not?
 
 People tend to miss the most obvious (and most dangerous) way to institute gun control That is to restrict the sale and manufacture of bullets. Without bullets, your gun is nothing but a paper weight. Bullets are also much more difficult to produce than guns. While they can be reloaded, casings are incredibly difficult to make on a small scale. The only way to really do it is to turn them down one at a time on a lathe. Dogs CAN be used to sniff out gunpowder and primers.
 
 This is a danger I think people miss when they start bannign certain types of ammunition. Right now, ""cop killer"" ammo is outlawed in the united states. Gun advocates laughed our butts off when they did this, since the ""cop killer"" amunition as they described it does not exist ouside of hollywood (NO, coating a bullet with teflon will not enable it to pierce body armor, it will lubricate your barrel when you shoot it, though). I personally don;t think this is anything to laugh about. BAnning guns is a stupid and unworkable plan, banning ammo could actually be dangerous.",1

 So, lacking any real material with which to attack his actual work, the anti gunners are essentially stepping back and calling him a ""dummy head"". In todays modern political/academic environment, what higher form of flattery can there possibly be than charachter assasination? It is what they fall back on when they find your argument to be irrefutable. 
 
 The NAS study was supposed to be ""their study"". Instead the findings basically run that anti gun researchers are mostly liars who use HIGHLY questionable methodology, pro gun researchers are refreshingly honest, and at the end of the day, the pro gunners have won the war of statistics. It is over, there is really no point to debating it anymore. We have seen the most scritinized review of the available data EVER, and the antigunners have had the wind knocked out of their sails. 
 
 Until some new data becomes available, I am pretty much done debating the statistical aspects. You want to call Lott a cross dressing dummyhead who was more than a little creepy as far as his defense of his work? go ahead. The fact remains that despite the anti gunners best efforts (which currnetly seems to be Donohue and Ayres), his work has been vindicated. 
 
 Now, if there is any anti gunner out there who dares argue history in regards to this, lets go! As Bryan pointed out in another thread, the antis generally seem to feel weakest in their argument when it comes to history, while the pro gunners seem to feel weakest when it comes to the social costs of gun ownership. GOOD NEWS for the pro gunners, we are now strongest in not only history, but the social aspects of gun control as well.

"5927","Gun registry has been a failure","THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION
 by Alan Korwin
 
 
 
 Dear Editor,
 
 Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns, so here it is. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first blush, gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all.
 
 The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime.
 
 1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive.
 
 Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a government jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent. That's why so many police departments are against it -- they'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources, and hire clerks instead of cops.
 
 2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime.
 
 Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place. Paperwork equals prison. That's just wrong.
 
 3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade.
 
 How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners.
 
 4. People have said to me, ""But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell.""
 
 Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive, opportunity, witnesses, physical evidence, the murder weapon. Police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component.
 
 5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you?
 
 Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York, California and Louisiana, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power. Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures? (Unfortunately, it's a long list of usual suspects.)
 
 And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed.
 
 Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely. This form of ""gun control"" isn't about guns, it's about control.
 
 I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.*
 
 Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the ""news"" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office.
 
 Sincerely,
 Alan Korwin, Author
 Gun Laws of America
 
 * NOTE: This case only concerned a limited class of weapons, ""destructive devices,"" which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act. Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor, and not the transferee, of such devices to file papers, and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem. In U.S. v. Freed, 1971, the Court agreed the problem had been fixed (for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case).
 
 A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem. A prohibited possessor cannot have a firearm at all, so mere possession is a serious crime. An additional charge for failing to register the gun that can't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case. However, possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon, with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure. The innocent would have to register to remain legal, the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself.",1

"4515","Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories, without exception. Reason or force, that's it.
 
 In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.
 
 When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.
 
 There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that we'd be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the mugger's potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat--it has no validity when most of a mugger's potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.
 
 Then there's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don't constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon that's as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldn't work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn't both lethal and easily employable.
 
 When I carry a gun, I don't do so because I am looking for a fight, but because I'm looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don't carry it because I'm afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn't limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation...and that's why carrying a gun is a civilized act.","Just in case you missed it:",1

David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research.""

 What these folks DONT realise, is that all firearms transfers made by licensed dealers are required bt BATF regulation to be recorded in the dealer ""bound book"" of firearm transfers. Federal law says they are required to keep these books forever, or if they fail to renew their FFL, they are required to send the bound book to the ATF. Also by federal law, they are required to make that bound book available to the ATF at any time, without a warrant, in order to facilitate the tracing of firearms.

"7921","When Chicago passed a ban on handgun ownership in 1982, it was part of a trend. Washington, D.C., had done it in 1976, and a few Chicago suburbs took up the cause in the following years. They all expected to reduce the number of guns and thus curtail bloodshed.
 
 District of Columbia Attorney General Linda Singer told The Washington Post in 2007, ""It's a pretty common-sense idea that the more guns there are around, the more gun violence you'll have."" Nadine Winters, a member of the Washington City Council in 1976, said she assumed at the time that the policy ""would spread to other places.""
 
 But the fad never really caught fire - even before last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the D.C. law and cast doubt on the others, including the Chicago ordinance before the court Tuesday. The Second Amendment may kill such restrictions, but in most places, it wasn't needed to keep them from hatching in the first place.
 
 Maybe that's because there were so many flaws in the basic idea. Or maybe it was because strict gun control makes even less sense at the municipal level than it does on a broader scale. At any rate, the policy turned out to be a comprehensive dud.
 
 In the years following its ban, Washington did not generate a decline in gun murders. In fact, the number of killings rose by 156 percent - at a time when murders nationally increased by just 32 percent. For a while, the city vied regularly for the title of murder capital of America.
 
 Chicago followed a similar course. In the decade after it outlawed handguns, murders jumped by 41 percent, compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States.
 
 One problem is that the bans didn't actually have any discernible effect on the availability of guns to people with felonious intent. As with drugs and hookers, when there is a demand for guns, there will always be a supply.
 
 Who places the highest value on owning a firearm? Criminals. Who is least likely to fear being prosecuted for violating the law? Criminals. Who is most likely to have access to illicit dealers? You guessed it.
 
 If we were starting out in a country with zero guns, it might be possible to keep such weapons away from bad guys. But that's not this country, which has more than 200 million firearms in private hands and a large, perpetual supply of legal handguns.
 
 Only a tiny percentage of those weapons has to be diverted to the underground trade for crooks to acquire all the firepower they need. While gun bans greatly impede the law-abiding, they pose only a trivial inconvenience to the lawless.
 
 This is especially true at the local level. Banning guns from one city makes about as much sense as banning them on one block.
 
 It's hard enough to halt the flow of guns over international borders, where governments police traffic. It's impossible to stop them from crossing municipal boundaries - which are unmonitored, undefended and practically invisible.
 
 Tens of thousands of cars enter Washington and Chicago each day from places where guns are easily and legally obtainable. Any of those vehicles could be transporting a carton of pistols to sell to willing thugs. If you're on an island, you're going to get splashed by the waves.
 
 The proponents obviously knew all along this city-by-city approach had serious shortcomings. But they figured it was bound to curtail gun availability somewhat. They also hoped that by prohibiting handguns in one place, they were beginning a bigger process.
 
 First, they expected that other cities and states would follow suit. Second, they wagered that strict controls at the local level would acclimate Americans to new regulations at the national level.
 
 But things didn't work out that way. The persistence of crime in supposedly gun-free zones didn't build support for broader gun control by showing the limits of piecemeal legislation. It weakened the case, by proving that such regulations have little impact on the people who present the biggest danger. Instead of a broad upward avenue, it was a dead end.
 
 Gun control supporters fear that if the Supreme Court invalidates local handgun bans, the consequences will be nothing but bad.

"9125","Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned.
 
 Reporting from Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault, not just because it targeted the city's police station, but for the choice of weapon: grenades.
 
 The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo, which injured four people, fit a disturbing trend of Mexico's drug wars. Traffickers have escalated their arms race, acquiring military-grade weapons, including hand grenades, grenade launchers, armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals.
 
 Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
 
 The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government's 2-year-old war against drug organizations, which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops, deployed by the thousands, as well as to attack each other.
 
 These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders, especially between Mexico and Guatemala. Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America, U.S. officials said.
 
 ""There is an arms race between the cartels,"" said Alberto Islas, a security consultant who advises the Mexican government.
 
 ""One group gets rocket-propelled grenades, the other has to have them.""
 
 There are even more ominous developments: Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month. Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices, which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq, killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago.
 
 The Mexican army has recovered most of the material, and there has been no reported use of such devices.
 
 Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months, used against police headquarters, city halls, a U.S. consulate, TV stations and senior Mexican officials. In a three-week period ended March 6, five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan. Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period.
 
 At least one grenade attack north of the border, at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers, has been tied to Mexican traffickers.
 
 How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known, and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers. Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States, as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels.
 
 There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons.
 
 But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station, four of the city's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco. In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles, the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers' pickup. The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile. The bodies of the officers were charred.
 
 ""These are really weapons of war,"" said Alberto Fernandez, spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government. ""We only know these devices from war movies.""
 
 U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago, and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago.
 
 The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years, in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years.
 
 The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar, with grenades and launchers produced by U.S., South Korean, Israeli, Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers. Many had been sold legally to governments, including Mexico's, and then were diverted onto the black market. Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies, authorities and experts say.
 
 The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia, hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan. Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd, killing eight people and wounding dozens more.
 
 Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan, federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico, just over the border from Guatemala. The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia.
 
 Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse, packed with explosives and high-caliber guns, reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel. Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache, which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade.
 
 Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey, which caused damage but no injuries, and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey. The device at the consulate did not detonate.
 
 Late on the night of Jan. 31, a Saturday, a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr, Texas. Three off-duty Texas police officers were there, though authorities would not say whether they were the target. The explosive, which did not detonate, was traced to the Monterrey warehouse.
 
 Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state. In the northern border city of Nogales, the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades. He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling.
 
 In the western state of Durango, three people, including a 3-year-old child, were killed in a grenade attack in January.
 
 The firepower has gone beyond grenades. Armed with light antitank weapons, would-be assassins went after the nation's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007. The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, who was not hurt. The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel.
 
 ""They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society,"" Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time. (He was killed in November in a plane crash.)
 
 Beyond the weaponry, drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics, including the use of assault rifles, hand grenades, grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces. This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally, as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas, killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel.
 
 ""At this stage, the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces,"" a U.S. government official in Mexico said. ""Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color,"" the official said.
 
 ""It's not your typical patrol stop, where someone pulls a gun. This has all the makings of an infantry squad, or guerrilla fighting.""
 
 The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango. On Valentine's Day, about 20 masked gunmen, led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains, stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co., an industrial explosives manufacturer, according to official accounts. They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse. Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area.
 
 Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite, the incident augurs an even bloodier trend, officials said.
 
 ""There is only one reason to have bulk explosives,"" said Thomas G. Mangan, spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""An improvised explosive device. A car bomb.""
 
 In addition to grenades, high-powered guns such as the .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers' arsenals, Mangan said. Unlike grenades and antitank weapons, the .50-caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico, like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols.
 
 Mexican law enforcement, such as the police in Zihuatanejo, is grossly outgunned. Officers have protested, seeking better protective gear, weaponry and pay.
 
 Shortly after the Zihuatanejo attacks, police officers staged a brief work stoppage outside their headquarters, where scars from the grenade attack were still visible. One of the blasts left a cereal bowl-shaped divot in the stone pavement and pockmarks on the front of the police building. It went off 100 feet from the nearest street, prompting some officers to suspect that the assailants employed a grenade launcher.
 
 Police have piled sandbags 4 feet high around the compound and security is tight. Commanders have bought 10 bulletproof vests, but say they need at least 280 to equip the city's 343 officers.
 
 The police commander, Pablo Rodriguez, said his officers are terrified. They are armed with semiautomatic .223-caliber rifles made in Italy, Germany and Mexico. The rifles, with folding stocks, are snazzy, but they are no match for the weapons being stockpiled by the drug cartels.
 
 ""They are good weapons, but to counteract the types of weapons they're using against us, they're not equal,"" Rodriguez said.
 
 His officers know they don't stand a chance. Not five days after the highway attack that blew up the police truck, Rodriguez had jobs to fill. Twenty-two of his cops had abruptly quit.","So, the news is now out on how the Mexican drug cartels are smuggling in weaponry from Central America and across the sea, how they're getting stuff that's been left over from wars long fought, and even how they're getting ahold of fully functional grenades, rocket launchers, and 40mm cannons.

"2531","Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.
 
 Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.
 
 First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.
 
 However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the ""dangerous"" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.
 
 Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.
 
 What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.
 
 A common remark is ""why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?"" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.
 
 Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own. 
 
 I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.
 
 -Dan","The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years. It expires this year.
 
 The right to own arms is expressly clear. It shall not be infringed by Congress. The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons, it does not have the power to limit them from citizens.
 
 Those people who ""you don't know (what they may do)""? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free. The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police. The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall ""back in the day"" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.
 
 The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
 
 The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.
 
 Some points I have for you:
 
 1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.
 
 Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:
 
 ""Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy."" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm
 
 Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.
 
 2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:
 
 http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151
 
 The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.

"2604","Ha! Brady is so ignorant he's blindly repeating the greatest statistic that points out the fallacy of his argument that you can find.
 
 You heard it! Straight from the mouth of Brady!
 
 Only 151 killings since 2007! He doesn't even mention how many of these were considered justifiable cases of self-defense! Just ""killings"" period.
 
 So, what he's saying is: In four years there have only been 151 lives taken by licenced CCW permit holders. Considering the number of folks posessing a CCW, and the number of killings that have happened in four years...........
 
 ......the result is a shocking .00000005 thousandths of a percentage point of total killings by CCW holders compared with killings by NON CCW holders!
 
 It seems like the hundreds of thousands of killings by NON CCW HOLDERS make the measly amount of killings by CCW holders pale in comparison.
 
 For example: Brady needs four years of data to come up with 151 ""killings"" (counting justified cases of self defense, as well).
 
 You only need the data for 2008 to find that over 180 children under 5 years old were killed by drowning in 5 gallon buckets.
 
 Soooooo........using the data provided by Brady we can determine with absolute certainty that:
 
 CCW holders are so safe, your child is more likely to be killed by a 5 gallon bucket within 365 days than a CCW holder in four years!
 
 Yet, when compared to non CCW holders, we're in deep trouble! Since 2007, NON CCW HOLDERS HAVE COMMITTED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS!
 
 Yet, in four years, Brady can only find 151 by CCW holders. Some of those 151 are even cases of justifiable self defense!
 
 Keep up the good work pointing out how safe the percentages are, Brady! I couldn't do a better job of pointing out how CCW holders are so safe, they're only responsible for .00005 thousandths of a percent of killings compared with NON CCW holders, myself!
 
 Maybe they should change their name to ""Brady Campaign to Prevent Bucket Drownings"". They would save more lives in one year than in four spent chasing CCW holders.","And terrorists probably kill less people in the US than non terrorists.

"6873","As I see it the problem in this country is not guns. The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of ""no one is responsible for their own behavior"". 
 
 Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer's. Colt comes to mind. Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member. The court's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime.
 That being the case, why can't the auto manufacturer's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime? Why can't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker's are unable to control the end use of their products. So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another?
 
 Another case in point. Less than a hundred years ago, if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out. Now if you murder somebody, you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter, get sentenced to 18 to 23 months, and be paroled in 9 to 12 month's on good behavior. Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. To them I put this question. What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom, raping and sodomizing her, putting her on a hot engine block, then strangling her. Don't know about the rest of society, but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book. By the way, the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer's dime.
 
 No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country. We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one. Guns are not the problem in this country. The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda.
 
 Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us, if you would actually read their purpose, you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual, only the public in general. I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control. Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated.
 
 For those who are going to say I'm a right wing nut job, I'll give you this. I served my country in various special operations forces. I can not go into anymore more detail than i'll give you here, so please don't ask. Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one. However, as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this. The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle. Death can come from anywhere at anytime. Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon. Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt. The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington) fired from an M-16 (or An AR-15) is just over 450 meters. A 7.62 x 54 mm round (a .308, a very popular hunting round) is about 1200 meters. To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile.
 
 I do carry a M1911 Colt .45 as a concealed carry weapon. After reading some of the other posts here, I must say I am deeply offended by someone saying that because I carry a CCW I'm going to shoot someone over a fender bender. I will say that their are some who shouldn't be carrying a CCW. And I do take responsibilty for my weapons. Unfortunately. I have had to use my weapon on a couple of occasions. Most of the time simply brandishing the weapon and taking control of the situation is enough to end it in a positive way. Only once have I had to discharge my weapon in self defense. By the way, the criminal in on the receiving end of that one had a very long and violent criminal history.
 
 I have shed the same blood in the same mud as alot of others to insure that EVERYONE in this country has the freedom to have their own opinions about things. That is a right guarenteed in The Constitution of the United States. Just as it is a right for me to own arms of my choice. Some would say that my RKBA is outdated. To them I ask, what if I think your right to free speech or freedom to religion is outdated? Should it be changed too?
 
 There are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing. But blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage. It is easy to blame guns for our problems. But they are merely a tool, like a shovel, that unless put into use by a person or persons. it merely just sits there and does nothing. Our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far. I do have a solution to these problems, but most would find it offensive. What the hell, I've probably offended alot already, so here goes. We have a three time loser law, that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal. Now alot of those crimes involve firearms. So if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes, you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately. It will take some time to get the message across but iI do believe when the message gets out, firearms crimes will be reduced drastically.
 
 Well, I need to get some things done so I'll write more later.

He chuckled and said, ""So you stayed in town last night?"" As the conversation progressed, it became clear that guns are as common in Mexico as tamales at Christmas. Everyone he knows, including himself, own at least one gun. And, it matters not whether it's a semi-auto or fully automatic, they're all illegal, so why stop with semi-autos? Though clearly illegal in the states in most instances, a lot of Mexicans have more firepower in terms of military weapons than we can only dream of owning here.""
 
 ""These are not the so-called ""assault weapons"" you can buy at the local gun shop in the U.S., but full select-fire military-issue rifles. Now, I know you want to know and are dying to ask; Did I see any U.S. military-issue weapons stolen from the U.S. military? Not a single one was marked with U.S. military markings. Everything was marked with additional foreign markings on the receiver, including M16 rifles, or they had nothing at all. I saw firearms manufactured in Europe, China, Russia and South America along with U.S. manufactured weapons. I saw rifles that looked familiar with no place of manufacture, no serial number or manufacturer's logo. The information was not removed, it was never there to begin with. I can only assume they came from illegal arms manufacturers in India or Pakistan that produce copies of weapons.

If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold.

"1082","""The Mexican Ambassador to the United States, Auturo Sarukhan, appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico. The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because ""most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States."" That is not true, but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda. 
 
 ATFE's Fake Number
 
 We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has made so many contradictory statements on the matter. ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90% of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US. 
 
 The problem is that 90% number isn't true. Yet, that hasn't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, of course, Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico's problems. 
 Real Weapons Source?
 
 The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now ""clarified"" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. 
 
 We can easily understand Mexico's reasons for preferring the 90% number to the more accurate 17%. Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels. Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police. Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from purchases in Eastern Europe. But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government's failure to police its borders, its ports of entry and its military installations. 
 
 Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels? 
 
 Lax Vehicle Inspection 
 
 Certainly, no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance. You can't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona. But for the sake of argument, what if it was true that 30% of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S.? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S.? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections. And could it be that Mexico's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun-smuggling operations? 
 
 Why Strange Obama Response? 
 
 But what accounts for the Obama administration's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence? Two explanations are possible: It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem. If we can end Mexico's chaos by making changes on this side of the border, that's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage. 
 
 The other explanation is more troublesome. Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself. It is obvious that Obama's teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans. The Obama crew's hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months. This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel's maxim: ""Never let a good crisis go to waste."" 
 
 Mexico needs to face its own demons, beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry. The U.S. can help in many ways, such as enhancing our own border security. But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico. 
 
 If we are lucky, this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction. If it is more than that, if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico's problems, then we are lost in a swamp. ""","""As President Calderón and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war,"" President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month. He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America. (In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States. And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico's government.) ""We're going to be very focused on this. It's going to be a top priority."" ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama ""felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a[s] it affects their safety.""
 
 You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90% figure, Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it. Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they don't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico.

"3888","STUTTGART, Germany - A 17-year-old gunman dressed in black opened fire at his former high school in southwestern Germany on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people before police shot him dead, officials said.
 
 Nine students and three teachers were among the dead, State Interior Minister Heribert Rech said. 
 
 It was Germany's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002.
 
 Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped, regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said.
 
 ""He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath,"" said regional police chief Erwin Hetger. ""I've never seen anything like this in my life.""
 
 After the attack, the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden, a town of 28,000, Hinderer said, before police tracked him down.
 
 The teenager graduated from the school last year, police said.
 
 Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman
 opened fire. Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school, which was evacuated during the incident.
 
 The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire, shooting at random, police said. Police said the suspect was dressed in a black.
 
 About 1,000 children attend the school, located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart.
 
 In 2002, 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers, a secretary, two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt.
 
 Steinhaeuser, who had been expelled for forging a doctor's note, was a gun club member licensed to own weapons. The attack led Germany to raise the age for owning recreational firearms from 18 to 21.","Well isn't that interesting. Germany has much stricter laws than America does when it comes to gun ownership, and their school shootings resulted in more death and devastation that Columbine.

The former will be disarmed by gun control laws because they have no plans to commit crimes and learn that laws are to be obeyed. The latter will not be affected at all by more gun control laws, because they already have easy access to guns through illegal channels and have no inclination to obey laws. If they did, they wouldn't be committing crimes in the first place. 
 
 The only way to stop the cycle of violence is to address the causes and stop the socialization. Morality, values, and discipline need to be instilled in the youth of America. The only way that can happen is by strengthening families and increasing the positive influences on their lives. All too often these troubled kids are left without adequate adult supervision, either due to imprisonment or overburdened work schedules. Absent parents, even if well equipped themselves, often cannot convey these concepts onto their children, so they grow up without them and learn their mores on the streets. Exacerbating the problem is the culture of the welfare state, where children grow up with welfare as a way of life and are accustomed to getting something for nothing. This often fosters a sense of entitlement. They've really never seen someone earn what they have through legitimate enterprises, so learn to idolize the criminal element who seemingly gain high status and material goods through illegal activities. 
 
 There are no easy solutions. Education must be reformed, family values rebuilt, the institute of marriage returned to a revered status, teachers better trained and empowered to teach not indoctrinate, and a government that understands it is there to serve, not rule. Gun control cannot and does not address any of these issues. Anyone who believes otherwise is deluding themselves into seeking a futile path towards stopping the violence. A gun can be an instrument to commit a crime, or it can be an instrument to stop a crime. It is the person behind it who chooses, and it is the person behind it who needs the change, not the law.","To those who are sympathetic to gun control.

"7186","Dublin, California (CNN) -- It's a Monday morning, and Vince Cefalu just got into work at his more than $150,000-a-year-job as a special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
 
 ""It's 9:30. This is what I affectionately refer to as the cage,"" Cefalu, 51, said. ""I am sitting here with an empty in box and nothing to do. I'll keep you apprised.""
 
 CNN gave Cefalu a video camera to document what he does at work. For five days, he recorded himself inside his own office.
 
 Cefalu said he was put in a job with little or nothing to do because he's the victim of retaliation by ATF managers. After spending much of his nearly 24-year ATF career going undercover with motorcycle gangs and white supremacist groups, he now oversees equipment inventory.
 
 ""I spent my whole life standing up to bullies,"" Cefalu told CNN in an interview to air on AC360 Wednesday night. ""The bullies right now are government bureaucrats who are abusing their oath and abusing the expectations of the public. I'm not leaving until this is resolved.""
 
 Records show ATF supervisors claim he's had performance and discipline issues.
 
 CNN has interviewed dozens of ATF supervisors, agents and employees around the country who said they've been demoted or labeled troublemakers just for filing a complaint.
 
 Later on the same Monday in which he brought a video camera to work, Cefalu was still having a slow day.
 
 ""I'm going to get something to eat, drag out the day a little bit, get some interaction with somebody ... Here I am, Safeway sandwich, a little news on, catching up on current affairs. I've had a few phone calls, personal phone calls that I've made, waiting for something to do.""
 
 At 3 p.m. that day, he records himself, saying ""...watching a little news, surfing the net, reading some e-mails, doing whatever, waiting for something to do. It's good money for not a lot of work, I guess. I'm being facetious, obviously.""
 
 He said ATF managers turned against him after he reported in 2005 what he said was an illegal wiretap plan in a racketeering case. Records show ATF disputes his claims of the planned illegal wiretap. But he said that started a series of retaliatory measures that ended up in 2007 with him in a desk job. His only negative evaluation, he said, was the year after he criticized the planned wiretap.
 
 ""Had I not exposed some unethical, potentially criminal clearly outside policy conduct and actions by law enforcement that I was working with, none of this would have happened,"" Cefalu said. ""I would still be working in the field.""
 
 ""I report to where they tell me to report to, and I sit for eight hours a day, and then I go home,"" he said. ""I do nothing.""
 
 Cefalu filed a series of grievances and an age-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but an administrative judge ruled against him. His attorney is appealing that decision.
 
 And over the past several years, he's also sent letters to members of Congress complaining about alleged fraud and mismanagement at the ATF.
 
 ""It's almost like being in an abusive relationship, actually. It's almost like domestic violence, really,"" said Hiram Andrades, a supervisor in ATF's Washington field office. ""It's just you think things are going to improve with each director, you think things will get better and improve, but they don't.""
 
 Andrades, who has a pending discrimination complaint, claims he was discriminated against because he can't get promoted.
 
 ""I can't get a promotion even if my life depended on it. If my life depended on it, I'd be dead by now, OK?"" Andrades told CNN. ""This type of retaliation isn't good for the agency, it's distracting and it's not good for the American people. We need to make better use of our tax dollars. We need to use it for the mission versus this kind of stuff. This is very distracting and not good for anybody.""
 
 ATF has not had a permanent director since Carl Truscott resigned in 2006. The agency is being run by Kenneth Melson, who has been deputy director since 2009.
 
 In an interview with CNN, Melson said he was not permitted to discuss employee cases. But he insisted that he does not tolerate any type of retaliation.
 
 ""When I first came into ATF -- when I went around and talked to people at headquarters and around the country -- my specific and very emphatic message was that everyone was to be treated with respect and dignity and there would not be retaliation,"" Melson said. ""I will not stand for retaliation against people who are abiding by our orders and reporting violations of law or regulations.""
 
 ""Every allegation of retaliation doesn't mean it's true,"" Melson said. ""Every person you talked to who perceives it's retaliation doesn't mean that it's retaliation, because there's been no adjudication of that. They haven't brought it to anybody to try to resolve it. Be careful when you talk to someone about retaliation, because there are many misconceptions and parameters of retaliation -- some of which are misinformed.""
 
 Asked about an employee who does virtually nothing all day, he said: ""Well, I will certainly look into it and find out why he is not doing anything all day."" He added, ""I will make sure that he puts in a full day's work, because everybody is going to put in a full day's work at ATF.""
 
 Since fiscal 2005, ATF has paid a total of $1.6 million to settle discrimination claims, according to federal government records. For the same time period, the FBI paid out $1.3 million and the DEA paid $331,755.
 
 In addition, records show, ATF has more discrimination complaints filed per employee than the DEA or the FBI.
 
 But Melson said complaints have gone down 40 percent since last year. And ATF officials added that the U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons have more complaints per employee.
 
 John Taylor, a former ATF special agent based in Las Vegas, Nevada, said he was the target of retaliation after he wrote an anonymous letter to the agency's inspector-general. In his 2006 letter, he alleged taxpayer money was being wasted on agents' unnecessary trips to Las Vegas.
 
 Taylor told CNN he was the target of an investigation into who wrote the letter.
 
 ""They asked me did I write the letter. My response was, 'I don't have to answer' ... they tried to charge me with lying.""
 
 He said he left ATF as soon as he was eligible to retire after 20 years, on December 31, 2009.
 
 ""I told my wife, I'm not going to live if I stay here,"" Taylor told CNN. ""I was depressed. It was hell for me.""
 
 Another agent in the Las Vegas office, who claims he was suspected of writing the anonymous letter, also alleged he was the target of retaliation by managers, according to records obtained by CNN. That agent was fired for failing to pass a firearms test, but later got his job back.
 
 ATF agents tell CNN that managers are taught how to handle discrimination complaints at supervisor meetings.
 
 CNN obtained a statement from a current ATF supervisor who attended such a meeting in March. During that meeting, ATF associate chief counsel Eleanor Loos gave a presentation to supervisors in the Atlanta field division.
 
 According to the statement, Loos stated that ""she considers the EEO process as the employees' 'bitching platform' and ""employees use this as a means to complain.""
 
 ""Loos stated in a bragging manner that the EEO process can be dragged on and can take up to three years,"" the statement said.
 
 Rafiq Ahmad, the ATF supervisor who wrote the statement, added: ""This is not the first time that I have heard Eleanor Loos making similar remarks. She has presented these same remarks in presentations in New Supervisor's training.""
 
 Melson told CNN he had not seen the statement. ""But what I can tell you is that the direction that I have given people is to make sure that we abide by the rules of the agency, that we abide by the process of the EEO, and the ombudsman. And that's why we have the process in place,"" Melson said.
 
 In a follow-up interview, Scot Thomasson, chief of ATF public affairs, told CNN that the bureau looked into the statements made by Loos.
 
 ""What we found is those statements were being taken out of context,"" Thomasson said. ""In addition, they were being characterized in a slanted matter by the person who wrote it.""","Very intriguing.",1

 You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA? 
 I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely. 
 
 I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.","Open carry is gaining momentum in Michigan, so who knows? And the I smell posers comment...well, I'll just say that I think you're jumping to a premature conclusion.
 
 I'm catching up on this thread and have a few more pages to go, but I wanted to address this comment before I go on. Most of us who openly carry in Michigan, are licensed to conceal, but we are carrying openly to promote the concept. Let me note that I, too, believe that openly carrying an unloaded firearm is asking for trouble. I can't see how it could make any situation safer, with it taking seconds to load a gun and get it into battery. Luckily we carry loaded here, which drastically changes the dynamics. When one can go from either concealment or a side holstered weapon to putting holes in a center mass in under a second, that's an effective deterrent. Then we hear the ""gun grab"" argument - if you're openly carrying, anyone could grab your gun. This just isn't practical. If a criminal wants a gun, h'es going to B & E a house or obtain it by other means than trying to take it off of someone who's wearing one. There's just too big a chance of getting shot. Not to mention that when someone is openly carrying, they generally have a heightened state of awareness. We pay more attention to what's going on around us. Another hitch in that argument is equipment. Most who OC, like me, have retention holsters. They ""lock"" the gun into place in the holster and a button must be pressed to draw the weapon. Therefore, someone wouldn't be able to just sneak up and pull the weapon from its holster.
 
 Criminals traditionally go for easy targets. If Joe is visibly armed and Pete isn't, which would be the more likely victim? If a thug walks into a C-store with ill intentions and sees a customer or two armed, I can say with certainty that the thug will wait until the store's empty or pick another location.
 
 Carrying openly can be an effective crime deterrent, and seeing armed good guys here and there is a constant reminder to the criminal element that we (, the People) are taking arms and proactively defending ourselves.
 
 Just bear these things in mind before jumping on the ""open carry is crazy"" bandwagon.",1

"5451","(CNN) -- Drug traffickers are planting millions of marijuana plants on U.S. public lands ever closer to tourist sites, guarding their plots with heavy weaponry, federal authorities say.
 
 ""We destroy their plants and they come back, sometimes to the same spot, and replant,"" said U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Russ Arthur.
 
 ""It's definitely possible that hikers and campers are going to find themselves in the middle of a field facing some very dangerous, armed bad guys, because this problem is everywhere, and it's only getting worse.""
 
 Across the nation, pot sites linked to cartels have been found in 15 states as far north as Washington, Arthur said.
 
 Last week, a portion of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada was closed to visitors while rangers dropped from helicopters into a marijuana farm a half-mile away from Crystal Cave, popular among tourists.
 
 Officials said there were five sites in the Yucca Creek Canyon where investigators recovered tons of trash, netting, chemicals and camping materials, a discovery that suggested the growers had been there, or planned to stay, for a long time.
 
 Though authorities destroyed the patch, whoever wanted to profit probably got what they wanted. Seventy-five percent of the plants had been harvested, said park spokeswoman Adrienne Freeman.
 
 ""Last week for six days, instead of having families and children walking down to Crystal Cave, we were flying helicopters to do a law enforcement operation,"" she said. ""That's not fair. You should be able to come to the park and enjoy it.""
 
 Freeman cautioned that there is a steep cliff near the site and most visitors wouldn't be skilled enough to trek into the area.
 
 But some might. In Idaho earlier this summer, hikers came upon 12,545 marijuana plants valued at $6.3 million, officials said. 
 
 This week, the National Park Service was working to eradicate plants at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, beloved by fishermen, where one year ago the agency brought out six dump trucks full of marijuana -- 10,000 plants -- valued at $8.5 million, according to chief ranger Mike Bremer.
 
 And on Friday, the Drug Enforcement Administration said it had found 14,500 marijuana plants growing in a patch of forest land 40 miles southwest of Denver, Colorado, where campers have ventured.
 
 The Forest Service has stepped up its efforts to raid forest areas in Georgia and Tennessee, including areas near the Chattahoochee River, a favorite among hikers, campers and adventure racers. The agency has started podcasting and posting signs on public land, trying to describe to regular folks what a pot field looks like and how to get away from it quickly.
 
 Though traffickers have been planting on public lands for years, figures from the U.S. Forest Service indicate the sheer volume of marijuana plants on public land has increased every year since 2005 -- by millions. And those are just the plants that the government knows about and has destroyed.
 
 Most pot farms are cultivated by low-level cartel workers, many who are working to pay off smugglers who helped them cross the border, officials have said. Campsites are sophisticated and well hidden, with foxholes and sniper nests, Arthur told CNN.
 
 The workers plant four to five farms at a time to get one bountiful crop, reckoning that two might be destroyed by law enforcement, one might fail because of weather, and another could be pilfered by what officers call ""pot pirates,"" Americans who risk getting close to traffickers to score free pot, Arthur said.
 
 Dean Growdon, an assistant sheriff and commander of the Lassen County, California, Narcotics Task Force, said he's especially concerned about pot farm violence now because hunting season is about to start.
 
 ""We get more reports this time of year from hunters who've stumbled onto sites,"" he said. ""We had a guy who discovered they were growing on the back portion of his property.""
 
 The sheriff's department knows firsthand of the dangers. Two deputies are still recovering from being shot in June when they stumbled on a pot field, Sheriff Steven Warren said.
 
 In the encounter, one of the deputies shot and killed a grower, Warren said, and the surviving growers are being prosecuted, he said.
 
 ""Our guys saw the field and were trying to make their way back to get help when they ran into the growers. There were two [suspected growers] laying back on a rock and when our guys saw them, there was a moment when everyone just froze,"" said Warren. ""There was a guy in a tent that had an AK-47 and our guys have a gun on him.
 
 ""To me, that grower, he was on a suicide mission. He could have never believed he would live through that,"" the sheriff said.
 
 Although federal agents have stepped up raids on sites across the country, arrests are tough to make because growers know the terrain like the backs of their hands.
 
 When authorities surprise them by dropping into their camps, growers dart off to hiding places or through the thick woods, making foot chases difficult.
 
 In July, a multi-agency sting in California's Fresno County -- the largest ever nationwide -- netted 420,000 plants, worth $1.6 billion, and the arrests of 100 people.
 
 As many as 82 Mexican nationals were taken into custody and deported, the Fresno County state attorney's office told CNN. So far, the U.S. attorney's office has charged 16 people. If convicted, those without prior drug charges would face 10 years to life and a $4 million fine; those with drug records could get double that sentence.
 
 But little intelligence is gleaned from growers. They don't want to talk, fearful of the consequences their families could face back in Mexico. It's still mostly a mystery how growers keep their camps going, how they transport their food, and where and how they move their finished product. It's also mostly unclear how they are managing to carry so much equipment -- piping, chemicals and basic living necessities -- into the deep woods. But it's clear they are causing expensive and irreversible damage to the ecosystem.
 
 Growers often dam up natural waterways with PVC pipe to redirect water to their plants, or poison the land and animals with insecticides. Many poach for food. Tons of trash is found scattered on the sites.
 
 In Sequoia National Park, $1 million has been spent since 2006 on marijuana plantation cleanup alone, and the damage done to Crystal Cave will be felt for years to come, said the park spokeswoman, Adrienne Freeman.
 
 ""We are continually discovering new species in that cave, and we are letting Mexican cartels threaten to wipe that out,"" she said.","Our national parks are safe as is, huh? Regular people have no reason to feel to need to carry concealed weapons for their own protection, huh? How can you be safe when mexican drug cartel members are literally behind the next bush and inclined to kill you for stumbling upon their operation?",1

 Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because it is flying under the radar.
 
 To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get all the information.
 
 Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless:
 
 .It is registered
 
 .You are fingerprinted
 
 .You supply a current Driver's License
 
 .You supply your Social Security #
 
 .You will submit to a physical & mental evaluation at any time of their choosing
 
 .Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25.
 
 - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail.
 
 .There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18. 
 
 The Government would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.

 I do think that it is interesting that the Mexicans are blaming the US for their violence problem. The Fully automatic AK-47s used in the beverly hills shootout were smuggled into the country from Mexico. Apparently the mexicans are exporting full auto weaponry and importing semi auto. 
 
 The truth probably lies somewhere in between. There is no question that mexico has a SERIOUS violence problem. Most mexican cartels used automatic weapons in the 80's and 90's, then their use fell off...probably as they learned that automatic weapons were a good way to chew up all your ammo and not accomplish a damn thing. Now they are downgrading to lighter stuff, and many of those lighter weapons are supplied by the US.","Yes, the flow of illegal guns may go both ways.

 In Switzerland, there is less than one homicide for every 100,000 citizens each year, and in 99 percent of the cases, a firearm is never involved. 
 
 There are a mere 26 robbery attempts each year for every 100,000 citizens.

"6111","Do we really need to charge someone being tried for armed robbery or worse with an additional petty weapons charge?","Actually, in regards to possession by felons, they are not petty weapons charges-at least in Virginia. Say for example you catch a crack dealer with a gun. He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack, but in my experience if he pleads guilty it would be a very, very rare occurrence for him to receive an active sentence of more than 2 years per charge for being a drug dealer. This is because the judge can suspend any part of or all of his sentence, and pursuant to this judicial authority the average sentence I see for per count of selling crack is 12-18 months. But if you catch him with a gun while he is selling, then the punishment for just on offense of having the gun is an automatic 5 years which cannot be suspended. I have seen many instances where the defendant gets far more time for having a gun than what he received for the actual underlying crime he commits either with or while having the gun. 
 
 But to come back to the issue, if registration is aimed at identifying and/or preventing illegal transfers and illegal possession of firearms, then in my opinion that goal cannot be reached because it cannot be enforced. Felons found in possession are already prosecuted for having the gun without a requirement to register them. A registration requirement will not aid in either their detection or prosecution because they will not comply with the registration requirement's command that they incriminate themselves-and no law can force them to register their guns so long as the 5th.

"2664","I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the ""it's not in the Constitution"" position. This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights. 
 
 Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void, not liberty.
 
 Scalia's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS's application of the Amendment in prior cases. Heller neither stated or established anything new; there never was a ""state"" or ""collective"" right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable, claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection.
 
 I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS's prior holdings that the right is not created, granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I'll never know or understand. 
 
 
 
 Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it.
 
 In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's ""prenumbra"" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:
 ""Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'""
 
 Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)
 This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .
 
 Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.
 
 Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961)

 DETROIT (June 30) - Gunmen in a green minivan opened fire on a group of teenagers waiting at a bus stop near a Detroit school on Tuesday, wounding seven including three who were in critical condition, authorities said.

 Another summer school student, 15-year-old Bria Wilson, said she was standing at the bus stop when she heard the gunfire. She said she was facing away from the shooters and ran away after the shots were fired. But she saw a 16-year-old male friend lying on the ground, bleeding.
 ""They were so close - it almost hit me,"" she said.
 Schools spokesman Steve Wasko said there was ""nothing that we're aware of at this time"" linking the shootings with any fight or dispute at the school.
 He said the shootings happened about 2:15 p.m., about 15 minutes after summer school students were dismissed for the day.
 Imam Abdullah El-Amin, who co-owns the Numan Funeral Home near the intersection where the shooting took place, said drug-dealing, prostitution and ""hopelessness"" are common in the area, he said.
 ""It's terrible that these things are just laying there, festering, in society - time bombs waiting to happen,"" said El-Amin, a Muslim minister and candidate for Detroit City Council.

Then buisinesses such as cabellas, pro bas shops, academy, and thousands of others would have to lay off, and possibly shut down.

"4920","Matt Speckman, a former Turlock police sergeant, used to be in charge of processing concealed gun permits. Now retired, he'd like one himself.
 
 ""I'm not a gun nut,"" Speckman said. ""But I've been involved in investigations of people now getting paroled who have probably been throwing darts at my picture in their cells.""
 
 Speckman, 49, attended the FBI academy, trained at a nationally recognized firearms course, earned an MBA, is studying for a Ph.D, toted a gun for 30 years and screened gun permit applicants for seven years.
 
 Yet Turlock Police Chief Gary Hampton and Sheriff Adam Christianson, both of whom have approved gun permits for politicians and prominent businessmen, turned him down.
 
 Speckman since has moved from Turlock and says he doesn't obsess about his safety. But reports about people who find favor with law enforcement executives despite relative lack of experience, he says, point up the arbitrary nature of concealed gun permits in California, where many agencies endure charges of political favoritism.
 
 As commander of his former department's internal affairs, Speckman once investigated a former officer whose resignation was demanded in lieu of firing, he said. But Christianson approved a permit for the former officer two weeks before denying Speckman's, he said.
 
 Having been on the other side, Speckman said he understands the heavy burden of determining good cause. What if someone granted a permit uses a gun recklessly? On the other hand, what if someone denied a permit later is harmed?
 
 ""I understand the need for case by case (discretion),"" he said. ""But the intent of the law is that someone who has more chance of being victimized should be given a permit.
 
 ""It's just gotten to the point where I wish there were something a little bit more standard.""
 
 He's experienced firsthand the threats that can follow people who work in the judicial system. That's one reason the list of people who have concealed weapons permits in Stanislaus County contains judges, deputy district attorneys and retired police officers.
 
 In 1991, two men broke into Speckman's home when he was away and met him at the front door when he returned -- armed with his own handgun. He was ordered face-down on the front lawn.
 
 ""(The gunman) said, 'You're going to learn to die execution-style,' "" Speckman recalled, and fired two or three rounds into the grass before fleeing.
 
 The men later were arrested, sent to prison and paroled. Although Speckman since has moved, neighbors told him they twice saw the gunman lurking around his former home.
 
 Sheriffs and police chiefs in California generally observe a court standard requiring them to judge a concealed weapon applicant's ""good moral character"" and ""good cause.""
 
 It's among a minority of ""may issue"" states, while adults meeting lower standards for buying firearms can get permits for the asking in 37 ""shall issue"" states; Alaska and Vermont allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits.
 
 Neither Christianson nor Hampton could be reached Friday, the same day a Bee article noted that Hampton takes political office into account when issuing permits. Two of seven he's approved are held by Turlock City Council members.
 
 Speckman said Hampton refused to consider his application when his one-year permit expired a year after he retired, and referred him to the sheriff's office, which has licensed 52 Turlock residents.
 
 ""You do not meet our criteria for issuance,"" reads Christianson's June rejection letter to Speckman.
 
 Speckman said he knew nothing about Hampton's unique request in 2008 to the sheriff asking him not to issue permits to Turlock residents without first sending them to Turlock police, until reading about it in recent Bee stories. Hampton's request came about the time Speckman retired; Christianson this week indicated he respects the request but retains authority to ignore it.
 
 No one in Christianson's office said anything about the Turlock arrangement, Speckman said. So he took a $100 firearms refresher course and paid $108 in permit fees only to be turned away, he said.
 
 ""No one said to me, 'We don't do Turlock; don't waste your money because we're going to deny it,' "" he said.
 
 Sheriff Adam Christianson is scheduled to address the issue of concealed weapon permits in a meeting of the Madison Society Foundation at 7 p.m. Monday in the Stanislaus County Library, 1500 I St., Modesto.","So what's the deal here?

 This is of course a nonsense. Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated'. Did it stop the US?
 
 Secondly, the specific example given; that of Japan, is a nonsense. These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs, who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender, he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns.","The source I cite is a Japanese Admiral who survived WW2, who took part in December 7. Those were his exact words, ""We were not fools to step in quicksand"". Meaning the officer was quite aware of civilian owned guns and yes they were afraid of grannies point shotguns out of kitchen windows. In China were there are no guns, the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will. 
 
 Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak. The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield. That is the job of the standing army, not the militia. The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader.

 Sorry for the slow response I have been trying to prevent the homeless from freezing on the streets at night.

 Buzzard decided 2:1 to uphold a law restricting concealed carry. But had the question been is there an individual right o keep and bear arms for one's own protection, the court would have split 2:1 in favor of that right. So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent. Heller was not about concealed carry, but rather the RKBA for self defense
 
 Of the 3 judges, only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller. Dickensen read the RKBA as a limited individual right to keep and bear arms for the protection of the state (a right which does not encompass self defense).",1

 at 8. But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operative

 operative provision is ambiguous. It might be argued, we suppose, that
 the prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determination
 of whether the operative provision is ambiguous&#8212;but that
 would cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather than
 just to resolve it. In any event, even if we considered the prologue
 along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we
 do today, since (as we explain) our interpretation of &#8220;the right of the
 people to keep and bear arms&#8221; furthers the purpose of an effective

"3122","Coming from a person who used to believe in more gun controls (myself), I'd like to say this post really sums up all the reasons I've changed my views on gun controls. Not only do they not work the way they are intended to, they make the constitution work the way it was intended to.","oh it gets better.... 
 
 
 Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control"" 
 
 
 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.
 
 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.
 
 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are ""just statistics.""
 
 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.
 
 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.
 
 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.
 
 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.
 
 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.
 
 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should ""put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run"" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).
 
 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.
 
 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.
 
 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.
 
 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a ""state"" militia.
 
 14. These phrases: ""right of the people peaceably to assemble,"" ""right of the people to be secure in their homes,"" ""enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,"" and ""The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people"" all refer to individuals, but ""the right of the people to keep and bear arm"" refers to the state.
 
 15. ""The Constitution is strong and will never change."" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.
 
 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.
 
 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't ""military weapons"", but private citizens shouldn't have ""assault rifles"", because they are military weapons.
 
 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.
 
 19. The NRA's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign is responsible social activity.
 
 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.
 
 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.
 
 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is ""an accident waiting to happen"" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are ""preying on their fears.""
 
 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.
 
 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.
 
 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.
 
 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a ""weapon of mass destruction"" or an ""assault weapon.""
 
 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.
 
 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.
 
 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.
 
 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.
 
 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.
 
 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.
 
 33. We should ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.
 
 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.
 
 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.
 
 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.
 
 37. ""Assault weapons"" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.
 
 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.
 
 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.
 
 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to ""keep guns out of the wrong hands."" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",1

Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.
 
 The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway.

 French Resistance - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","From wiki: During the Italian Campaign of 1943 and 1944, 100,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side, notably in the fighting on the Winter Line and Gustav Line. By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered more than 400,000 strong. 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the in the British Special Air Service Brigade (S.A.S.); the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, under General Leclerc, landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and eventually led the drive towards Paris, while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the French First Army, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and joined the U.S. 7th Army in Operation Dragoon. This operation was the Allied invasion of southern France. The Allied forces advanced up the line of the Rhône River to liberate the Vosges and southern Alsace.
 Are we good so far?
 
 Again from wiki: The French Resistance played a valuable role in facilitating the Allies' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and Provence on August 15, by providing military intelligence on the Atlantic Wall and Wehrmacht deployments and coordinating acts of sabotage on power, transport and telecommunications networks.

 That is why I also give examples of other countries such as Great Britain and New Zealand (both of whom have a general police force that is itself unarmed).
 
 I say this because the was an argument put forward to suggest that without a heavily armed citizenry, the people could be oppressed. So, rather than deal with a hypothetical - what if this happened in the USA, I thought I'd look to where there are actual cases of democracies with unarmed citizens.
 
 There are differing degrees of gun control. Canada has a fair few guns... but I don't believe it's a 'constitutional' issue.

 Don't trust the cops to be in your best interest. Authority is authority. Authority is not in the business of charity, nurture, or progressiveness. Authority is about control. At all levels, from the PIG cop giving tickets for kicks, to tyranical rape and murder; authority is about control. Ask any cop from any country. They will tell you, when they put on a uniform, something ""magical"" happens. It is the semblance and air of AUTHORITY. Do you really think politicians enter politics for ""public good"". They all want the office, they want the bearing of the office, they want PRIVILEDGES of office. If they want to be about charity and public good, they why aren't they working for charities? Why aren't they working in labs to cure cancer? Why aren't they in soup kitchens? Why aren't they clegry? Because none of those idealist efforts offer the priviledges, bearing, and authority of office. Come on, you know they want it. No matter what country your from or what political system, you know they want it.
 
 Firearms are not a necessary requirement for freedom. They are a necessary requirement for fighting oppression. I am quite happy to have my politicians and elected represenatives fear me.
