 What a traitor!","Here is the link to the report Brady mentions:
 
 http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/reports/fedleg/obama-1styear-report.pdfBrady
 
 I'm sorry, Brady, that you feel Obama has betrayed you by supporting (or at least not opposing) a few gun owner friendly initiatives. And here I thought this was supposed to be change you could believe in. Have you ever thought to consider he does so because he thinks it is the right thing to do? Are you willing to consider his motives and give him the benefit of the doubt? Probably not. You probably think he is just afraid to upset gun owners. And there is probably some truth in this. Based upon his past rhetoric I do not doubt that Obama would push gun control if he thought he could. But you have to look at things from his perspective-a ""what is best for me as politician"" viewpoint. 
 
 You have only yourself to blame if you're disappointed in Obama. It was you and people like you at the BC who placed such unrealistic hopes in him without considering how little he needed your support. Guns were not an issue in his election, and contrary to whatever you might believe he does not owe his position to the support of the BC. Really now, with everything else he is trying to accomplish, what do the complaints of a fringe anti-gun group with limited membership matter to him? It's not like you and the other BC supporters are going to vote for Sarah Palin in the next election. At worst, Obama knows you could grow petulant and boycott him by refusing to vote at all in the next election. But he can calculate how few votes he would really loose. 
 
 Look at it from his perspective, Brady. The BC competes directly with the NRA. Both organizations make their own arguments, use their own rhetoric, cite their own statistics and studies, and yet it is the NRA which dominates with membership. The bottom line is the NRA and BC have for years gone head to head in the free marketplace of ideas, and the BC has lost. It is the NRA which has several million members, not the BC. And, in addition to normal membership fundraising there are hundreds of non-profit tax-exempt Friends of the National Rifle Association fundraising committees nationwide. Friends of NRA, National Rifle Association of America Each one is a local grassroots organization made up of volunteer community business and social leaders, and each one hosts an annual banquet to raise money which is spent back in the local community-primarily for youth shooting sports and education to ensure the future of responsible gun ownership in America. The BC has no way to challenge this kind of grassroots power. The NRA offers a positive message to its members. You have the right to keep and bear arms. You can be trusted to make decisions about the security of yourself and your family. Punish the criminal, and leave the law abiding alone. The NRA dominates the political landscape because, like AARP, this message attracts millions of members. People who are willing to donate their time, their money, and cast their votes to support the RKBA. People like me, Brady, who have done more to fight gun crime this month than you have done in your entire life. 
 
 Look at it from Obama's perspective, Brady. What does the BC offer to oppose this? It peddles fear. It offers tired complaints about how people cannot be trusted to care for themselves. It takes hypocritical positions which undermine its credibility. For example, it claimed the NRA's ""Eddie Eagle"" program message was ineffective, and then it decided to sell the exact same message under its own name. http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12966-chilling-resemblance-between-north-korean-indoctrination-eddie-eagle-program.html#post360048 It still offers a re-tread of a failed ""assault weapons ban""-despite knowing it was a failure. And it has supporters like you, Brady-people who want the failed AW Ban back so bad they are willing to make up a lie to sell it to us, only to run away and hide when you got caught lying: http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11381-rise-police-deaths-because-no-ban-assault-weapons.html No, I haven't forgotten that one. 
 
 Brady, you cannot expect Obama to waste political capital fighting against such a large number of gun owning voters over ideas so bankrupt you must make up lies to support them. And don't call him a traitor when you know you've given him no cause to feel confident in your own support of him. If he took on gun owners, then do you really think he can rely upon the support of someone like you who lies and then runs away at the first sign of a challenge? If you really want his support, then first offer him something he can actually sell to the public with a straight face and then give him some assurance you won't run away at the first sign of trouble.",-2.6,0
"5388","This fine upstanding pillar of the shooter community had a ccw permit.","So?
 
 Last time I checked, MASS MURDER was against the law. Didn't care too much for following that one, did he?
 
 This is like pointing out that the man who drove through a retirement community killing 3 elderly people and 2 grandchildren in a drunk driving accident was a liquor store owner.
 
 According to your logic, this would mean he was a drunk driver because he was a liquor store owner, therefore, all liquor store owners are drunk drivers.
 
 But according to my logic, instead of focusing on a mere ""feel good"" bit of information, I would look at the actual drunk driving records of liquor store owners. What if I found out that this was the only incident of a liquor store owner killing someone in the past 50 years?
 
 Which is closer to the truth: Your assertion that liquor store owners are all dangerous because of this one incident, or mine that they aren't because of the actual facts?
 
 The state of Virginia has no requirement for a CCW permit. CCW permits are available for request for those citizens who desire documentation in order to carry in other states. There have been over 225,000 permits issued in Virginia.
 
 This means: HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY HAVING NOT REQUESTED A PERMIT? (We know at least 225,000 are carrying there because they have requested one).....let's be conservative and say that half of them have done so. This means that over 50% of gun carriers enjoy paperwork. My guess would be less than half desire documentation, but hey, I'm gonna be conservative.
 
 So, over 500,000 people carrying CCW in Virginia everyday and one of them goes nuts.
 
 This means that CCW holders account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent of shootings in Virginia. (It looks like this - <.01%) 
 
 What's the murder rate for the general population in Virginia, Penfold?
 
 By stating that this one shooter had a CCW, are you trying to point out to us that the crime rate for CCW holders in Virginia is 20 times better than the general population, or 50 times better?
 
 Maybe you're trying to point out that it's 75 times better?
 
 Even if it's only 10 times better......
 
 ....it is still better (in multiples) than NON CCW holders!
 
 WHAT DO YOU FAIL TO GRASP ABOUT CCW HOLDERS COMMITTING SUBSTANTIALLY FAR FEWER CRIMES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD?
 
 (BTW: This is just CCW holders in Virginia. Now go through the entire nation! ......and you point out that one has committed a murder! Wow! That's a real crime wave! One out of millions and millions! Whew! Maybe if another CCW holder commits another murder in a few more years IT WILL BE A TREND!)",-3,0

"1876","Excerpts from a recent report:
 
 ""It has been claimed that in the United States, 'guns are used for defensive purposes about five times as often as they are used for crimes'.1,2 This claim is made even though the criminal chooses both the time and place of the crime, most households don't have guns, and very few of the individuals who own guns are carrying at any time...
 
 ""After controlling for other aspects of the surveys, these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self-defense gun use. For example, in May 2000, a Washington Post national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not counting military service, have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at?' Twenty-three percent (23%) said yes. In that same month (May 2000), a Gallup national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not including military combat, have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it?' Seven percent (7%) of respondents said yes....
 
 ""So how can anyone claim that there are more self-defense gun uses than criminal gun uses? They do so by comparing different types of surveys. They compare the results of Box B with Box C! However, it is completely inappropriate to compare estimates which come from two radically different survey methodologies.....
 
 ""Second, there is no accepted understanding of what constitutes a criminal or a self-defense gun use. For example, criminals often believe that their gun use during a crime was in self-defense...
 
 ""The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once in a lifetime. It is a rare event. Other than self-defense, the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable. Regular citizens with guns, who are sometimes tired, angry, drunk, or afraid, and who are not trained in dispute resolution, have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses. People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime. It should not be surprising that inappropriate, socially undesirable 'self-defense' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6""
 http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/files/Bullet-ins_Spring_2009.pdf
 
 What do we learn? The claim that guns are used much more often in self defense is based on making inappropriate comparisons. If the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use, many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense. Most of the ""defensive gun uses"" reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns.","I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed ""most households don't have guns"". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.

And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.

Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense.

 Good citizens vs criminals with the criminals 'winning' is usually not the way it goes. Good citizens are the ones who catch and throw the criminals in jail.

The way your talking you act like the only way for the good citizens to win is to have a gun or be ready to use force.
 
 If you want to do one better you could eliminate guns completely in order to lower the risk of deaths in gun fights. You can't debate the fact that less guns equals less murders. You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.

"3351","The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. 
 
 Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:
 ""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""
 The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)
 
 We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state.

It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons, but the right can be infringed with due process of law. In fact, the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed. One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation:
 
 ""If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building...
