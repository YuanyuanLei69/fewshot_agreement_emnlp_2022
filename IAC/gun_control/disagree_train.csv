"8060","Perhaps the most enduring factoid of the gun prohibition movement is that a person with a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to shoot someone in the family as to shoot a criminal. This ""43 times"" figure is the all-time favorite factoid of the gun-prohibition lobby. It's not really true, but it does tell us a lot about the gun-prohibition mindset. 
 
 The source of the 43-to-1 ratio is a study of firearm deaths in Seattle homes, conducted by doctors Arthur L. Kellermann and Donald T. Reay (""Protection or Peril?: An Analysis of Firearm-Related Deaths in the Home,"" New England Journal of Medicine, 1986). Kellerman and Reay totaled up the numbers of firearms murders, suicides, and fatal accidents, and then compared that number to the number of firearm deaths that were classified as justifiable homicides. The ratio of murder, suicide, and accidental death to the justifiable homicides was 43 to 1. 
 
 This is what the anti-gun lobbies call ""scientific"" proof that people (except government employees and security guards) should not have guns. 
 
 Of the gun deaths in the home, the vast majority are suicides. In the 43-to-1 figure, suicides account for nearly all the 43 unjustifiable deaths. 
 
 Counting a gun suicide as part of the increased risk of having a gun in the home is appropriate only if the presence of a gun facilitates a ""successful"" suicide that would not otherwise occur. But most research suggests that guns do not cause suicide. 
 In the book Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck analyzed suicide data for every America city with a population more than 100,000, and found no evidence that any form of gun control (including handgun prohibition) had an effect on the total suicide rate. Gun control did sometimes reduce gun suicide, but not overall suicide. 
 
 ....
 
 But just as many other people who would commit suicide with a gun would use an equally lethal method if guns are unavailable. Many of the people who kill themselves in firearm accidents may also be bent on destruction, regardless of the means. One study of gun-accident victims found that they were ""disproportionately involved in other accidents, violent crime, and heavy drinking."" (Philip Cook, ""The Role of Firearms in Violent Crime: An Interpretative Review of the Literature,"" in Criminal Violence). 
 
 Or, as another researcher put it, ""The psychological profile of the accident-prone suggests the same kind of aggressiveness shown by most murderers."" (Roger Lane, ""On the Social Meaning of Homicide Trends in America,"" in Violence in America, Vol. I, 1989.)","You know, Philip Cook. The famous Anti-gun researcher.",0
"846","Furthermore, law abiding citizens can sell their guns to criminals in private transactions. In these transactions, the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history?","So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime.",0
"2998","The way to do it is to pass stricter gun-control laws.","And what're you going to do when a criminal says ""F**k you and your gun control, it's not gonna keep me from getting a gun if I want one""?",0
"2283","The fact is, we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day. Risk is a part of living. I would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime, when other methods (better locks, alarms, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers) can be effective.","Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.
 
 Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.
 
 Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.
 
 Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics. 
 
 And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.
 
 All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.",0

 In the wake of a nasty multiple shooting at a Pittsburgh, PA-area fitness club by a not-so-clearly psychotic man identified as George Sodini, America&#8217;s gun prohibitionists &#8211; led by the Violence Policy Center and Freedom States Alliance &#8211; are clamoring for restrictions or repeal of concealed carry statutes.
 
 In the case against legally-armed citizens, the VPC has even manufactured an innuendo-riddled &#8220;study&#8221; to support their prejudices. My colleague, Cleveland Gun Rights Examiner Daniel White, writes about the shooting here.

 Why is gun control more likely to increase crime that reducing it?
 It emboldens criminals to commit crimes against what they perceive to be easy targets. How often do pawn shops get robbed? Not very, as everyone I've ever been in, the employees all carry a sidearm. Nice try, but DOJ statistics bear this out.

 Oh? You lived in Bosnia? Hmm.. I'm glad a coward like you wasn't around when the British 'army' came calling on the Colonists who were 'family fathers'.
 Afghanistan: Do you really think that the Afghanis would have had the same chances against the Soviets without Stingers or CIA training showing them how to plan terrorist attacks? Sure, without gun control the second-mightiest army would have never attacked Afghanistan...
 The Afghans were causing all kinds of grief before we got involved. So, yeah, the Stingers, etc. were a help, but not the deciding factor.
 
 Warsaw: That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry. In the ghetto of Warsaw, there WAS an armed uprise. The result? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge. And if they had more guns, maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes. 
 Yeah, it's stupid to defend yourself. Maybe they weren't as cowardly as yourself and didn't want to die on their knees like you would? Oh, the Germans did shell and bomb the Ghetto as I recall. And here I thought you were an expert on European history?
 
 Please don't you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3. Reich. 
 Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of Hitler's power or the way that WW2 went.
 I'll bring up whatever I want to, idiot. So, cram it! Once gun-control was established by the Nazis, how were his opponents suppose to overthrow him had they decided to?

 However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion.

The committee was not asked and does not offer any conclusions or comments on gun control policy.

The report contains an entire chapter and three appendixes that address the rather large literature on these laws. The report cites both studies that do find positive effects and studies that do not find positive effects.

 [T]he right to possess a firearm of one&#8217;s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms

 In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners&#8217; asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case. The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one&#8217;s choosing&#8212;a handgun, for petitioners&#8212;is one that is &#8220;comprised within theterm liberty&#8221; in the Fourteenth Amendment

"8356","Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms, vehicles and other public places, according to an inspector general report.
 
 The officers, with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ""did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and, as a result, lost a significant number of firearms"" between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008, the report said.
 
 In all, 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period, according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner. Of those, 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers' control -- for instance, ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer. Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes.
 
 But 74 percent, or 179 guns, were lost ""because officers did not properly secure them,"" the report said.
 
 Following a review of the draft report in December, Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy, according to a response in the report. A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment.
 
 The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms. ""Instead, DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms,"" it said. ""Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient, personnel did not always follow them.""
 
 The inspector general cited several examples of ""inappropriate practices."" A customs officer, for instance, left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store. The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside. ""A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler,"" the report said.
 
 In addition, an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home. Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon, according to the report. Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant, and it was gone when he returned.
 
 ""Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot, a bowling alley and a clothing store,"" the report said.
 
 ""Although our review focused on CBP and ICE, other components described similar incidents. For example, a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later,"" said the report. ""Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons.""
 
 Of the 179 lost because of laxity, 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost, the report said. That resulted from the agencies' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms, as well as ""a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm.
 
 ""Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen, our analysis showed that these firearms were lost (stolen) because officers left the firearms unsecured,"" according to the report. ""All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms.""
 
 The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer, the report said. The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers, but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.","Well that's a real holy XXXX moment right there.

 Number one, socialization plays a huge role in an individual's reaction to handling weapons. A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty.
 
 I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the ""gun"" with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both; some from competition and some from fight / flight. . .
 
 Both groups would exhibit the ""aggressive"" behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge, . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the ""aggressive"" domineering subjects.
 
 I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects:
 ""Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment, we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab. Therefore, all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical. Given that subjects had been deceived, we next debriefed them, emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited.""

"2947","MEXICO CITY - Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.
 
 After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the Attorney General's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.
 
 ""According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions,"" office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.
 
 The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. No charges have yet been filed.
 
 Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon, which is near Gomez Palacio. In that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.
 
 Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.
 
 Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon, the capital of northern Coahuila state, he said. At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15, local media reported.
 
 Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. ""Unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells,"" he said.
 
 Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the Zetas.
 
 Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences. But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.
 
 Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation ""can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.""
 
 Also Sunday, Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.
 
 Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan, 39, as a top member of La Linea gang, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.
 
 Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez.
 
 Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma, though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General's Office, as Ledezma is.
 
 La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.
 
 Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.
 
 His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.
 
 Also Sunday, the Attorney General's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.
 
 Elsewhere in Tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.
 
 Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico's pipelines.
 
 In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of Acapulco. Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month.","So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.",0

 Cities in Ohio, and other places where tarry stops are common, take notice. YOU are the law breakers. Not people Open Carrying firearms. 
 
 Sorry but, Ignorance of the law is no excuse! emoticon_smile","Let me interject a little 4th. Amendment primer here....
 
 The terms ""Terry stops"" and ""Terry frisks"" come from the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). Cases often hinge on the particular facts involved, and the facts in Terry were: 
 
 ""A Cleveland detective (McFadden), on a downtown beat which he had been patrolling for many years, observed two strangers (petitioner and another man, Chilton) on a street corner. He saw them proceed alternately back and forth along an identical route, pausing to stare in the same store window, which they did for a total of about 24 times. Each completion of the route was followed by a conference between the two on a corner, at one of which they were joined by a third man (Katz) who left swiftly. Suspecting the two men of ""casing a job, a stick-up,"" the officer followed them and saw them rejoin the third man a couple of blocks away in front of a store. The officer approached the three, identified himself as a policeman, and asked their names. The men ""mumbled something,"" whereupon McFadden spun petitioner around, patted down his outside clothing, and found in his overcoat pocket, but was unable to remove, a pistol. The officer ordered the three into the store. He removed petitioner's overcoat, took out a revolver, and ordered the three to face the wall with their hands raised. He patted down the outer clothing of Chilton and Katz and seized a revolver from Chilton's outside overcoat pocket. He did not put his hands under the outer garments of Katz (since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon), or under petitioner's or Chilton's outer garments until he felt the guns. The three were taken to the police station. Petitioner and Chilton were charged with carrying concealed weapons. The defense moved to suppress the weapons."" 
 
 From these facts we developed the law involving temporary stops and pat downs of citizens. The law regarding ""Terry stops"" can be best summarized as follows:
 
 ""[A]n officer who has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may conduct a brief, investigatory stop. While ""reasonable suspicion"" is a less demanding standard than probable cause, there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stop.... The officer must be able to articulate more than an ""inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch'"" of criminal activity"". Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 119 and 123-124 (2000)
 
 Therefore, a ""Terry stop"" is a ""seizure"" under the 4th. Amendment, but it is not a full arrest. The detention and questioning must be brief. Taking a man out of a theater and questioning him would be a ""Terry stop"" which would require ""reasonable, articulable suspicion"" of criminal activity. From the article it appears the judge has ruled at a preliminary motions hearing that the officers did not have the required level of suspicion to detain the man.
 
 A ""Terry frisk"" is a ""weapons frisk"" or ""pat down."" It requires an additional reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify this ""frisk"" or ""pat down"" search. In Terry the suspicion of armed danger arose from the type of suspected criminal activity (planning a robbery) in which it is reasonable expect that one or more of the three men involved would be armed with a weapon.
 
 Note, however, that a 'Terry frisk"" is limited to the outer layers of clothing. The hands cannot penetrate pockets, for example. The ""frisk"" is a search for weapons only. If the officer feels what he reasonably believes is or could be a weapon then he is allowed to penetrate the pocket, for example, to get the object out. But this is allowed only where it is ""immediately apparent"" from the ""frisk"" that the object is or could be a weapon. 
 
 If the article is correct, then the search involved in the theater case went far beyond a weapons ""pat down."" Absent some exigent circumstance (and the article does not mention that any existed) the level of search done in this case required ""probable cause""-which is the standard of proof needed to justify a full arrest for a crime. 
 
 It is possible that both the detention and the search will be held unconstitutional-but the violation is of the 4th and not necessarily the 2nd. Amendment. 
 
 (Both of which read ""the right of the people"", in case anyone has forgotten. Will anyone here suggest the armed man cannot sue because the phrase ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"" guarantees only a ""collective"" and not an individual right?)
 
 I also want to address the article's brief mention of Florida v. J.L. because it is misleading: 
 
 ""United States Supreme Court in Florida v. J.L. (2000) (detaining man on mere report that he has a gun violates the Fourth Amendment)."" 
 
 This gives the impression that SCOTUS has ruled the police cannot detain someone who is reported as having a gun-which is not the case. ""J.L."" was a 16 year old juvenile and it was illegal for him to have a handgun. That Florida law was not in dispute, nor was the ability of the officer to make a ""Terry stop"" and conduct a ""pat down"" for a weapon if he had the required level of ""reasonable, articulable suspicion"" that J.L. had a gun. The issue was not whether the police could detain and frisk a man on a report of having a gun, but on whether the anonymous report in that case claiming he had a gun was credible enough to be relied upon to provide ""reasonable, articulable suspicion"": 
 
 ""An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not, without more, sufficient to justify a police officer's stop and frisk of that person. An officer, for the protection of himself and others, may conduct a carefully limited search for weapons in the outer clothing of persons engaged in unusual conduct where, inter alia, the officer reasonably concludes in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons in question may be armed and presently dangerous. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30. Here, the officers' suspicion that J. L. was carrying a weapon arose not from their own observations but solely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller. The tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make a Terry stop: It provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant's knowledge or credibility."" Florida v. J. L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000)
 
 As I said, cases hinge on the particular facts involved. In my experience news reporters often make broad assumptions without understanding how each individual fact fits into the legal puzzle.",0

 Nov 6, 2009
 
 
 Washington, DC - Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement about the tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas:
 
 ""Our deepest sympathies go to the families who lost loved ones or are today visiting them in the hospital. Along with the rest of the country, we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment.
 
 ""When I heard of the tragedy yesterday, we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as 'mentally incapacitated' or 'mentally incompetent.' In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected. 
 
 ""America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues, workplaces, health clubs, high schools, universities, police stations and now Army bases. This latest tragedy, at a heavily fortified army base, ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places. Enough is enough.""

"2395","There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the ""right to keep and bear arms"". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. 
 
 < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea 
 
 < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.","So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?

 Now who should we believe more, your or the papers that relate the news to us?","Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.
 
 Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.",0
"7152","I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision. In that decision, the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years. I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as ""[i]t is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America"" which have little basis in fact:
 
 ""The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom..... But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number.... Since the early 1980s, the National Rifle Association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption' laws, forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws. Today, more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun-control laws, which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws....Clearly the 20,000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science. And however it was initially derived, the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total. The most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws?' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws, and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws.' ""
 http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf
 
 So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality, a decline in the number of gun laws, and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns? Could it be that pro-gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms?","From your source which indeed does have its own slippery slope built in. ""Another problem with estimating the number of gun laws is agreeing on a definition of just what is to be included. For example, many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places. Inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws."" And here comes tada one of the slippery slopes. ""But if one considers only laws that control the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns-the cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun-control laws-the number of local laws will be much smaller. With most gun laws containing numerous, interrelated subparts, there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law."" And yet another. ""In short, no matter how the 20,000- gun-law figure was initially derived, the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total. Even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20,000."" Yea right! ""In our view, the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun-control statute (with some states having as few as one or two such laws) yields a far more appropriate figure for public-policy discussion."" In other words we don't really have a clue here but we'll call it short so we win. Nice try though.",0

 And while U.S. political leaders and presidential candidates have focused rhetoric, money and time on stemming the northward flow of drugs and illegal immigrants, far less has been said and done about arms flowing south, largely from states with liberal gun laws, into a nation where only police and the military can legally own a firearm.

 You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are.

 Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:
 ""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""
 The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)

 ""Appellant, Peter B. Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun.

Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.')""

 ""Appellant Raymond Rybar, Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 922(o), which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.' On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment. Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity....Rybar's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,' as required in Miller, 307 U.S. at 178.

 What I don't get is the what seems to me like an overwhelming fear of ""what if"" from both sides. The pro-gun camp fears that any gun regulation policies, something as simple as a county registration, will inevitably lead to policies that ban all guns. And the anti-gun crowd fears that if people can own guns at all, then gun-toting bandits will jump out of every alley and start popping people randomly. So its a case of total gun freedom vs total ""gunlessness"". I'm not convinced that either of these ""what-if"" scenarios will occur.

 Well if you don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns,but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits,thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun. 
 
 I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom?
 What we are saying is, to many laws on it no more.
 
 35-40 years ago we didn't have all this B.S.about it,you wanted a gun you went and got one (in other words very readily available)
 Walk down the street with one and you didn't have a S.W.A.T.team on you.
 
 We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or
 amendment comes along we are antsy about it.
 
 So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.
 
 And for the record:gun toting bandits(out here we say bandito's)are jumping
 out of every ally{figuratively speaking}.But the pro-gunners know that if the
 anti-gunners had their way,only the bandito's have guns.

 The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger, ""dangerous knife"" or razor ""with intent to use the same unlawfully"". Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.
 
 Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against ""undesirable"" elements. Sponsor ""Big Tim"" Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.",0

Please continue checking your email and NRA-ILA :: for any updates on AB1810. AB2223 was re-scheduled for next week. 
 
 AB1810 would establish a registration system, similar to the one currently in place for handguns, for all newly-acquired long guns. Under AB1810, the make, model and serial number of the firearm as well as the identifying information of the purchaser would be recorded and kept on file by the California Attorney General's office. 
 
 If AB1810 were enacted, violent criminals would continue doing what they do now - obtain firearms through illegal means. This bill would not decrease crime but will rather have disastrous effects on the already financially unstable Golden State. AB1810 would impose additional burdens on California's taxpayers to maintain the registration system as well as on the state's licensed firearms dealers, small businesses who already deal with extensive business requirements. 
 
 One simply needs to look at Canada, a nation with draconian firearms registration, to see the results - billions in cumulative administrative costs, annual cost overruns, no clear substantiation of public safety benefits, unjust prosecution, and a bureaucratic complexity that daunts those willing to comply. Ironically, California is considering a new registration scheme as Canada is considering doing away with its system.","Let's ask our California resident what he thinks of this new law.

 Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the ""only registered guns are legal guns"" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.
 
 And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth.

"5068","President Obama poses a real and present danger to the Second Amendment, and he's working to pack the Supreme Court with justices who will undermine Americans' gun rights.
 
 Mr. Obama didn't fess up to this radical agenda when running for the highest office in the land. ""I have said consistently that I believe that the Second Amendment is an individual right, and that was the essential decision that the Supreme Court came down on,"" Mr. Obama told Fox News in June 2008. Despite the campaign rhetoric, Mr. Obama is appointing judges who strongly oppose that position. The most recent pick, Elena Kagan, ran much of President Clinton's war on guns from 1995 to 1999.
 
 When Ms. Kagan served as Mr. Clinton's deputy domestic policy adviser, she was a feverish proponent of gun control. From gunlock mandates to gun-show regulations, she was instrumental in pushing anti-gun policies, according to the Los Angeles Times.
 
 Every court nomination counts. Two years ago, the Supreme Court barely mustered a narrow 5-4 majority to strike down the extreme District of Columbia gun ban. Should Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the four more conservative justices retire or die while Mr. Obama is in office, the high court likely will undo such narrow victories for the Second Amendment. While Ms. Kagan was nominated to replace the liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, and thus won't swing the court in a new direction, her being there will necessitate that gun owners concentrate more than ever on fighting outright gun bans.
 
 Ms. Kagan's defenders acknowledge her liberal political views but claim that as a judge, the former Harvard Law School dean will somehow manage to separate her judgments from her political opinions. The hitch is that her legal views correspond with her political views. When Ms. Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, she wrote, ""I'm not sympathetic"" to the claim that ""the District of Columbia's firearms statutes violate [an individual's] constitutional right to 'keep and bear Arms.' ""
 
 Her memos to Justice Marshall foreshadow an activist judge who wouldn't hesitate to fall back on her own personal views to override policy decisions made by elected officials. She clearly counseled Justice Marshall on how he should rule based upon whether she thought policies made ""sense."" Take her advice in the case of Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, in which an appeals court stopped federal agencies from issuing a permit to build a ski lodge in a national forest. Ms. Kagan might feel that stopping ski resorts from such building makes ""policy sense,"" but that isn't the job of a judge.
 
 Ms. Kagan is Justice Sonia Sotomayor's soul sister when it comes to gun control. Last year, during her confirmation hearings, Ms. Sotomayor insisted the Supreme Court had never found that an individual right to self-defense exists. Two of Justice Sotomayor's own appeals court decisions came to the same conclusion. One ruling denied there is an individual right to self-defense. In another case, even after the Supreme Court struck down the District's gun ban, Judge Sotomayor opined that any restrictions on self-defense would pass constitutional muster so long as politicians who passed it said they had a good reason.
 
 Senators must realize that a vote for Ms. Kagan for the Supreme Court is another vote against gun rights.","Anyone who votes for Kagan might as well tender their resignation.",0
"6142","Seven thousand two hundred thirty-four. If Chicago is your home, that number tells you something about your city, and police say it's not necessarily good.
 
 As CBS 2's Kristyn Hartman reports, there have been 7,234 guns recovered or confiscated by Chicago Police so far this year. When you think about it, that's about one gun for every 400 people, in a city with an ordinance that prohibits them.
 
 Chicagoan Robert Herbert hears gunshots all the time in his neighborhood. He says lots of people have them.
 
 ""All the time, every day, yesterday, the day before yesterday,"" Herbert said.
 
 Police are finding some of the guns.
 
 ""So far year to date, there's been seven thousand, two hundred and thirty four firearms recovered in Chicago,"" said Deputy Chicago Police Chief Nick Roti.
 
 Roti says the number, which is up, really tells the tale of two cities.
 
 One is the mean streets story.
 
 ""Guns are found in parks, under porches,"" Roti said.
 
 The other is the safer streets story.
 
 ""The good news is we're recovering the guns,"" he said. ""I think people are getting fed up with public violence, It's evidenced by reporting of it.""
 
 Roti says increased search warrants net guns. Buybacks, patrol stops and putting cops in the right places also net guns.
 
 Police say most of what they recover comes from south of the Stevenson Expressway, generally the South Side of Chicago, in neighborhoods like Englewood. There, gangs, drugs and firearms all seem to go together.
 
 Herbert is happy with the work, but he fears the guns are replaced as quickly as they are removed.
 
 If it were legal, he says he'd have one for protection.
 
 When asked if there is a justification for carrying a weapon, Roti said: ""Not really for me to say. It's against the law in Chicago.""
 
 National Rifle Association Legislative Liaison Todd Vandermyde said if people were allowed to have a weapon for self-defense, it would ""absolutely"" deter crime.
 
 ""But Chicago has put its citizens in victimization mode, because they haven't allowed them the use of self-defense,"" he said. ""The only guys carrying guns on the streets are the bad guys.""
 
 The city's 27-year-old handgun ban is under court challenge.
 
 Meanwhile, police hope to challenge street violence with a provision waiting for Gov. Pat Quinn's signature. It would mean gang members caught with guns would spend a mandatory three years behind bars.
 
 The ordinance would be named after Alex Valadez, a Chicago Police Officer who was killed.","So Chicago has a total handgun ban, no exceptions for anyone except politicians with influence. Gangs are routinely armed with Chicago-illegal weaponry. The number of weapons has recovered has jumped to 7,000+ just for this year.
 
 And apparently Chicago thinks it knows better than the federal government. They're not playing ball with the mandatory five year prison sentence that armed criminals are supposed to face.",0

"6156","The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. 
 
 Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:
 ""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""
 The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)
 
 We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia.","Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns.

"1582","Statement on Fort Hood Tragedy
 Nov 6, 2009
 
 
 Washington, DC - Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement about the tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas:
 
 ""Our deepest sympathies go to the families who lost loved ones or are today visiting them in the hospital. Along with the rest of the country, we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment.
 
 ""When I heard of the tragedy yesterday, we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as 'mentally incapacitated' or 'mentally incompetent.' In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected. 
 
 ""America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues, workplaces, health clubs, high schools, universities, police stations and now Army bases. This latest tragedy, at a heavily fortified army base, ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places. Enough is enough.""

"2953","There are some objections that I have to that interpretation. 
 1) It does not examine the meaning of the term ""bear arms"" at the time of the writing of the Constitution.
 
 2) In most second amendment cases the courts have not agreed with the above interpretation. 
 
 3) The American Bar Association rejects such an interpretation.
 ""Since today's 'well regulated militia' does not use privately owned firearms, courts since Miller have unanimously held that regulation of such guns does not offend the Second Amendment...As lawyers, as representatives of the legal profession, and as recognized experts on the meaning of the Constitution and our system of justice, we share a responsibility to the public and lawmakers to 'say what the law is.'""
 http://www.abanet.org/gunviol/secondamend.html
 
 4) Historians H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel explain the language of the second amendment this way-
 ""It does not say: 'a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed'....it wasn't written that way. Rather, in the first part, the verbal vehicle elected for the verb 'to be' is a participle, yielding a phrase known to grammarians as an 'ablative absolute construction.' This construction characterizes a phrase modifying the substance of the main clause as an adjective would modify a noun, often expressing the condition or circumstances of the assertion of the main clause. It creates an indissoluble link between the two parts of the sentence, and grammatically subjects the right to arms to the rule of the militia modifier. As a simple matter of grammar, the participial modifier is essential for the declarative clause to occur. Had the two statements- regarding the importance of a militia and the right to arms- not been joined in this manner, it might have been possible to argue that even if the first declaration ceases to be true, the second is undiminished. And it seems significant that the Framers chose the structure they did.""","SO we are sticking with the now defamed ""collective right theory"" As of yet you have not explained:
 
 How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.
 
 why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to ""the people"" in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.
