 Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil.

 It's always interesting to me that the bible thumpers refuse to look at abortion other than through religious, save the fetus, eyes and yet, are ready to KILL the sicko's of society when they have committed a haneous crime. Too many ""thumpers"" don't read all of bible.
 
 And yet the same bible states:
 
 Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. 
 
 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23 
 The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. 
 
 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 
 
 Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. 
 
 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 
 
 God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. 
 
 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 
 (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.)

 I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:
 1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization. It is pointless to argue this fact, because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable. The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. Period.
 2) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being' or a 'person.' These are not scientific terms. It is impossible to 'prove' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being.' The argument could be made, for example, that a 'being' must have some sort of self-awareness. It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness.
 
 So, to answer your question, regardless of what anyone believes, a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on.

To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make.

"3100","SIOUX FALLS, S.D. - In the fight to preserve the toughest abortion ban in the nation, the talk is not of a fetus' right to life. It's of a woman's right to motherhood.
 
 Antiabortion activists here deliberately avoid the familiar slogans of their movement. They don't talk about the ""murder of innocent babies"" or quote the Bible on the sanctity of life. Instead, campaign manager Leslee Unruh has taken what she calls a feminist approach, arguing that legalized abortion exploits women and - for their sake - must be stopped.
 
 ADVERTISEMENT
 The bumper stickers and T-shirts that fill campaign headquarters spell out her message, in pink and blue: ""Abortion Hurts Women.""
 
 ""We women buy the choice line. We're panicked, or we're being pressured, or we're ashamed to have a child outside marriage,"" Unruh said. She speaks from personal experience; she had an abortion nearly 30 years ago and said her life since has been darkened with regret and longing. ""If you don't do your job right as a mother,"" Unruh asked, ""what good is everything else?""
 
 Abortion-rights supporters call such rhetoric patronizing and presumptuous; they say many women find that ending unwanted pregnancies brings relief and the freedom to pursue other dreams. But they acknowledge that Unruh's tactic is effective - and that it has thrown their campaign off balance.
 
 ""Historically, this debate has been focused on fetal rights, fetal life. We have a lot of language about that,"" said Sarah Stoesz, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and North and South Dakota. ""This adds an element we're not accustomed to. It's a different line of debate.... And that is something we struggle with politically.""
 
 The ban, passed overwhelmingly by the South Dakota Legislature in February, makes it a felony to help any woman terminate a pregnancy at any stage, unless an abortion is necessary to prevent her death. Women would not face criminal charges, but their doctors could get up to five years in prison.
 
 Rather than challenge the law in court, Planned Parenthood chose to put it to a public referendum, gambling that people would vote to repeal it on Nov. 7. (South Dakota law permits interest groups to refer legislation to the ballot if they can collect enough signatures.)
 
 If voters reject the ban, abortion-rights advocates hope it will deter states such as Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Georgia and Rhode Island, which have been considering similar measures. If the ban is upheld, Planned Parenthood will challenge it in court. Antiabortion leaders would welcome that battle. They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will use the case to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to abortion.
 
 Both sides call this election crucial and are putting out urgent appeals to raise millions of dollars for the fight.
 
 But if this is the frontline of the abortion wars, the guns sound oddly muted. 
 
 Attuned to the values of this very conservative state, abortion-rights activists have decided not to make a stand on a woman's right to choose. The big poster outside their campaign headquarters makes a much milder point: ""This law simply goes too far."" One of their TV ads starts out: ""South Dakotans agree, honor and protect human life."" The ad goes on to affirm support for reducing the number of abortions, but argues that the law is too inflexible.
 
 The only exception in the law states physicians will not be prosecuted for procedures ""intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother."" Even then, however, doctors must try their best to save ""the life of her unborn child.""
 
 A provision allows women to use the morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex. But under South Dakota law, pharmacists are not required to dispense the pill - or refer women to a pharmacy that will. And the Legislature has repeatedly voted down a bill to require emergency rooms to stock the contraceptive.
 
 Walking a neighborhood of gracious homes the other day to rally voters against the law, Emma Tupper, 20, made just one pitch, again and again. ""Our main concern is the lack of exception for rape and incest,"" she said. Some residents nodded and pledged to vote against the ban. Nearly as many politely said they would support it.
 
 ""Even if there's no exception for rape and incest?"" Tupper asked one elderly man.
 
 ""I've looked at the bill pretty closely, and I feel comfortable with my decision,"" he replied, and closed the door.
 
 Tupper - who came from Seattle to work on this campaign - walked on, crunching through drifts of yellow leaves. ""It's a tough state,"" she said.
 
 An independent Mason-Dixon poll in June found voters opposed to the ban, 47% to 39%. But a Zogby International survey last month, commissioned by an antiabortion group in Washington, D.C., found that gap had narrowed to 47% to 44%. In another unsettling sign for abortion-rights supporters, four Republican state senators who opposed the ban lost their seats in the primary election this summer.
 
 ""I don't know if I want to say we have a lot of momentum,"" said Jan Nicolay, a former Republican legislator working to overturn the ban.","Like they said in the article, you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers, you can say the baseball hurts men, because many of them get hurt.

 The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.
 
 Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.
 
 One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.",-3.8,0

Abortion is illegal in Tanzania (except to save the motherÂ’s life or health), so women and girls turn to amateurs, who may dose them with herbs or other concoctions, pummel their bellies or insert objects vaginally. Infections, bleeding and punctures of the uterus or bowel can result, and can be fatal. Doctors treating women after these bungled attempts sometimes have no choice but to remove the uterus.

 I tried to PM this to you but it wouldnt let me because it was too long.","I'm not exactly sure your point with this article. Was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? That they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? Trust me, you have told me nothing new. In fact, I am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more.
 
 It said: Although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . I almost peed myself laughing when I read this. Whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. What is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? I have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. How much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other?
 
 The article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of ""abortion is wrong because it's murder!"" that pro-life people seem very fond of. This is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong).
 
 I point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: Before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order.
 
 This entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. The argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). As I see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. To ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women. 
 
 If you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? I'm amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the CDC has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. The most compelling evidence I've seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. They found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease.

If some pushy, arrogant, selfish, a-hole came up to me and started preaching to me how theft is wrong I would probably be turned off by him but I would still have to realize that it isn't these people that decide what is wrong....right and wrong just are what they are (an absolute if you will). Since you don't believe in a God you say you trust your heart. I can advise that you should be careful of this as some tend to make their heart believe what is right is what they want....a foolish mistake.

I do not think any such uninformed person has a right to an opinion, but since you have decided you do, let me try to inform you. A doctor would never ""stick a pair of scissors"" into a baby's head. Any propaganda that has told you otherwise is just that, propaganda. If the doctor is ""holding in his hands"" a baby about to be born, (which implies labor) and that child weighs more than 500 grams (just under two pounds), he is required by law to do all in his power to protect and support that child's life. Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother's life is at stake, no, it does not always ""save the mother's life"" in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary. Example- the mother has advanced liver disease, when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child, but as her pregnancy advanced, so did her disease, so that now she is in complete renal failure. The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy, she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy. He urges her to abort the child, in order to save her life. This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method.
 If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy, she might die, the child might die as well. But if she chooses not to have the child, she lives to fight another day. 
 Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that ""god says you gotta put your life at risk and carry this child, even though both of you might die""????

They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks.

I mean, so much for joining any of those adult dating services...I suppose becoming a priest is much easier.","Let me for a moment frame my blasphemous take on Christianity, the trinity, etc.
 
 Folks, you have an Almighty Father God, the first aspect; then, you have a Holy Spirit--must be male, wasn't that the entity that impregnated the Virgin Mary?; thirdly, the Son, male of course.
 
 No females allowed. Please note that. Exclusionary of females. Male only club. So...what do these exclusively male deities do in the heavens all day--well, sounds like a homosexual club to me so I just speculate on that.
 
 All these prohibitions against female power and participation smack to me of a whole bunch of folks who haven't come out of the closet and dealt honestly with their sexuality.
 
 Nothing wrong with being homosexual. Dunno about constantly repressing it and denying its existence, though.",-1,0
"2116","How can you not see what it is? And also, how can you assume everything is a human without any criteria? With your logic, I have to assume anything that shares human DNA is a human being.","You didn't answer the question....what is your standard for intelligence?
 
 You also incorrectly use my logic.",-2.4,0
"5057","Do pro abortion people support euthanasia as a reason for abortion?
 
 Meaning for instance... if after amniocentesis it is discovered that the child has down syndrome or if it is discovered the child will be born with no legs the previously hoping and willing parents decide to abort for this reason. Do pro abortion people support this?","An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word ""euthanasia"" is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.
 
 I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).
 
 Don't like it? ... TOUGH!
 
 And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself.",-2.8,0
