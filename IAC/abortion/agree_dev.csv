 I rather think that the incidence of abortion is far lower in Europe owing to their higher standards of sex education and access to contraception without the impeding hypocrisy of American religious culture.","Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). 
 
 There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that ""UK will be Islamic"", ""Sharia Law for UK"" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly ""taking over"" ).
 
 ""muslims are taking over the world"" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!",1,2

"314","5, By L. LEWIS WALL
 MOTHERHOOD is a blessing, but in many parts of the world childbirth leaves women permanently injured and turns them into social outcasts.
 
 In West Africa, only about 1 percent of pregnant women have Caesarean deliveries because the procedure isn't widely available. When labor is obstructed, the baby is trapped in the pelvis, and labor can last up to a week.
 
 Women who survive this ordeal can develop a hole in the bladder called a fistula. This injury - caused by the prolonged pressure of the baby's head on the soft tissues of the pelvis - causes continuous and uncontrollable loss of urine. The millions of women in Africa and Asia who suffer from fistulas are often shunned by their communities for the rest of their lives.
 
 In Liberia, I operated on a woman who had endured a fistula for 35 years, and it took only 20 minutes to repair her injury. Including a month of hospital care and the surgical supplies needed, the operation costs about $300 to $450. All a clinic needs is spinal anesthesia, intravenous fluids, basic surgical instruments, sutures and a catheter for draining urine.
 
 It's even easier to prevent these injuries from happening in the first place. With supervision, local village ""labor monitors"" can learn to track the progress of a birth and send the woman to a hospital when labor lasts too long. Trained birth attendants can detect abnormalities in labor by using a partograph - a simple graph that charts the progress of labor and tells attendants when to intervene.
 
 The World Health Organization tested the partograph in 35,000 births in Southeast Asia and found that using it cut the number of prolonged labors almost by half. Widespread use of this simple early warning system would go a long way toward saving babies' and mothers' lives - and making fistulas a thing of the past.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every woman in the world had access to decent prenatal care, if every woman in the world could be guanateed safe childbirth, wouldn't it be wonderful?

 Updated: June 13, 2009 02:07 PM 
 COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - A state Republican activist has admitted to and apologized for calling a gorilla that escaped from the Riverbanks Zoo Friday an ""ancestor"" of First Lady Michelle Obama.
 
 A screen capture of the comment, made on the Internet site Facebook, was obtained by FITSNews, the website of South Carolina politico Will Folks.
 
 The image shows a post by an aide to state Attorney General Henry McMaster describing Friday morning's gorilla escape at Columbia's Riverbanks Zoo.
 
 Longtime SCGOP activist and former state Senate candidate Rusty DePass responded with the comment, ""I'm sure it's just one of Michelle's ancestors - probably harmless.""
 
 DePass told WIS News 10 he was talking about First Lady Michelle Obama.
 
 DePass has been involved in state politics for decades, and helped elect Republican Governor Jim Edwards in 1974. He was an early South Carolina supporter of former President George W. Bush in 2000....","http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp

"7247","[SIZE=7][SIZE=7]Not many people close to me know my story but for once I'm actually ready to share with other people. Maybe I can reach out and help somebody or help people see the reality. When I was 16 I was curious about sex because a couple of my friends had done it and I (for some dumb reason) wanted to see what it was like for myself (peer pressure, I guess). So it happens that my period doesn't come. I find out that during this most unpleasurable experience he decided to take the condom off. I knew I was pregnant. And I knew that my mom would kill me if she found out so I kept it to myself. After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me, had me take a pregnancy test, and as I said was ready to kill me. She was ashamed and really didn't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby. I also knew deep down that I was not ready to have a baby nor did I have the financial means to take care of one (unless I wanted to live off of welfare). The father was not going to play an active role in this baby's life, as far as he was concerned this was all a big joke to him. So I went to the clinic ( passed through all the pro-life activists) and had the procedure done. I was scared but you know, I knew it was the right thing to do. I'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets. I would have a child that would be around 11 years old. I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living. I'm married now and have 2 children that I love and adore. They have a good life. I'm glad that I had that choice 11 years ago. A second chance to make it right.","First of all, welcome :D

"9218",".... It was a reassuring message that Mr. Obama takes seriously his duty to safeguard women's lives and basic rights, including free speech and the choice of whether to bear a child.
 
 The gag rule was first imposed by President Ronald Reagan. It barred any health care provider receiving American family planning assistance from counseling women on abortion, engaging in political speech on abortion or providing abortions, even with its own money.
 
 .... That seriously disrupted the best quality and most accessible family planning services in poor countries. It denied women access to desperately needed contraceptives, help in preventing H.I.V.-AIDS, and maternal care. Mr. Obama's executive order lifting the financing ban will mean fewer deaths from unsafe illegal abortions.
 
 Mr. Obama's stated intention to work with Congress to restore financing to the population fund also is a life-saving step. It ends the sorry exercise by which Mr. Bush repeatedly blocked money approved by Congress to advance poor women's reproductive health, reduce infant mortality, end sexual trafficking and prevent the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS.
 
 To justify this cruelty, the Bush administration perpetuated a bogus charge that the population fund has either stood by or helped with coerced abortions in China.","Very nicely stated in an editorial in today's New York Times:

"6236","Women are human beings with rights and should be treated as such, rather than as breeding machines.","I agree, women are not child bearing cubicles thats only function in life is to have babys. What trouble's me is that, if men had to go through what women did in pregnancy, the pro-life movement would be totally non-existant. Men are really not capable of being pro-life without being a hypocryte, as they have not experienced pregnancy. Why that is not true of the pro-choice side, is that we let the women choose, and she can choose both ways if she wishes. The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women, to the point of violation, yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies. Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like, but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money.
