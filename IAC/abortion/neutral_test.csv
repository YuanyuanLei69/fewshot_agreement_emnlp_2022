"6557","Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.
 
 The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion ""I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else"" or ""I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else"". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.","My stance on morality is based on the following observations:
 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.
 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.
 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.
 Those are observations, not proclamations.
 The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering.
 
 What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made?
 
 Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation ""black people should be slaves to white people"" and build a morality based on that. My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering.",-0.4,1

But I actally disagreewith ""consciousness"" being a necessary quality of ""human beings"", since it's unreasonable to believe that we stop being people when we go to sleep.

It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person.
 
 It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says ""we don't value human life"". If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human, is not an individual, is not alive, or is in some other way not worthy of respect. Or you have to make a case that ending it's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things.
 
 I am pro-choice, but only because I don't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity.

You have to realize that there is something behind the proclamations of that sort of morality; human life is sacred isn't just a proclamation, it's a philosophy. The case could just as easily be made that pro-choicers are basing their morality on a proclamation as well, that ""reason is the basis for morality"".
 
 Even if you call either a case of proclamation, it's the philosophy behind it that serves as the basis for the morality, not statement itself.","What are the reasons which you would present behind the statement ""all human life is sacred"" (or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro-life stance)?
 
 If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations, then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority. 
 
 I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of ""treat others as you would have yourself be treated"". When, as children, we were scolded ""How would you like it if ..."" that is a tactic of teaching this rule. For those who are religious (which I only marginally, occasionally and hesitatingly am), even Jesus stated ""Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you."" in the Sermon on the Mount talk (as quoted by ShadowPikachu). Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule, which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality.",-0.6,1
"757","Sorry I missed your thread on that. It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or/complete debilitation (like paralysis), and I'd be much more open to that. But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. 
 
 I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.","I agree that all other reasonably safe options (such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc.) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures.
 
 As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on.
 
 For example:
 - What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm?
 - What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis?

Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction, a child take's another child's toy ""That's mine"", they say, they may fight over it, but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things, violent conflict is the result.
 
 It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent, both individually, and in shaping the law of a society. A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm.
 
 It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective, based on value judgements, ie ""People have a right to life, because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion"", or ""People have a right to have an abortion, because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus"". There is nothing to debate, we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake. In a free society we can disagree over what is ""more important"" and make our own choices, but if value judgements are used to determine law, the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values.

 Re ""The Sex Speech"" (column, June 12):
 
 Nicholas D. Kristof recognizes the depth of racism and the breadth of sexism in the United States.
 
 But nonwhite women in this country face both, and suffer real consequences as a result: African-American women are four times more likely than white women to die in childbirth.
 
 The United States ranks first among developed nations in the number of women who die because of pregnancy-related complications.
 
 Every woman has the right to survive pregnancy. There is no reason, as Mr. Kristof notes, that the United States should not be a leader in making this basic human right a reality. That means financing reproductive health services, from contraception to maternal health care.
 
 What better way to address the intersection of racism and sexism and ""to repair America's standing in the world"" than to save women from dying during pregnancy, whether they live in an African village or Greenwich Village?

 I would be interested in seeing where you get your statistics that most births are impossible and most end in c-section. The women's body begins preparing for birth from the minute she becomes pregnant. There are hormones released that allow for the cartilage to soften which allows the pelvis to spread as the child is born. Yes, birth is hard on the woman's body, but personal responsibility comes into play. You did the deed, you don't punish another for it.
 
 I am honestly torn on this one. Though I can see where it would be almost impossible for a woman to live with this, much less have a child that comes from this foul deed, I still don't see where the child is to blame for the rape, thus it should not be punished.
 
 Much used and abused argument. Can't really be proven or disproven until it is tested, so I am not sure there is an argument. This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV, so it has become this seemingly powerful point. Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal. 
 
 I would rather they overscreen than underscreen.
 
 I agree. I do not agree this means kill more babies. That is about as humanistic as you can get (besides killing handicapped children). It all leads into a big, black hole.
 
 Religion influences all laws. Without that influence, there would be no laws. Note: humanism is also a religion!","#1 See the post titled ""Biblical Failures"" in the Religion section of this forum. If the Bible has a single inaccuracy in it, then it cannot be considered 100% true. This post shows inaccuracies so the Bible cannot be considered a reliable source for things that cannot be proven and that includes trying to say whether an unborn baby has a soul. Besides, why should you be able to force your beliefs on everyone else? Perhaps you could justify a law that says all Christians cannot have abortions.
 
 #2 A child who is unborn is not being punished by having its life ended. Even if you believe in the Bible, the child is going to simply ascend to heaven without having to suffer here on earth. If you do believe in the Bible and don't believe this above fact, then you are saying that God will punish the child for being aborted.
 
 #3 Your moronic statement about how there would be no laws without religion discredits your writings anyways. Laws do not stem from religion. They stem from the need for a society to be able to function properly. They stem from mans desire for power. Some do stem from religion but this does not make up the majority. If you wish to try and debate this, why not explain how religious influenced the laws concerning driving on a specific side of the road more than social influences did.
 
 #4 Getting back to the abortion debate, what do you have against abortions? Assuming you cannot simply get off by saying the Bible says this or religion says that, what else can you say? The fact is that abortion does not affect you. You can preach about abortion being bad and even protest it, but why should you try and force your beliefs on others? I know this is the essence of Christianity, but why should it extend to society? Pro-choice at least lets people decide what is best from them and the child.

"4747","The Killing of George Tiller: A ""Pro-life"" Murder?
""Pro-life"" as the self-description of the anti-abortion movement has a fundamental flaw at its heart. The moral absolute of ""life"" is not applied consistently, in my view, by the majority of those in this movement. Many in the ""pro-life"" anti-abortion movement seem to me to only be pro-life in the case of abortion -- unlike those who hold an ethic of life across a range of moral issues, not only abortion but also war and the death penalty, This makes ""pro-life"" in regard to abortion not only an inconsistent ethic, but an unstable one.
Nothing exposes this fundamental inconsistency and instability in the ethic of life as a description of the anti-abortion movement more than ""pro-life"" murder.
.... Violence has been a part of the anti-abortion movement from the beginning, from the overt violence of the murder of other abortion providers to the covert violence of harassing women trying to get to clinics for reproductive services.
Violence is a logical outcome of the extreme self-righteousness of those who claim the ""pro-life"" label as an absolute and yet who do not have an actual, consistent ethic of life such as the views held by pacifists. Dr. Charles Kimball, a Baptist minister and professor of religion at Wake Forest University, well explains this logical connection in his book When Religion Becomes Evil. According to Kimball, two warning signs that indicate a religious viewpoint is becoming evil are ""absolute truth claims"" and ""the end justifies any means.""

 Seems to be a pretty convenient verse to throw around. Does anyone who actually quotes the Bible bother to look up the Hebrew meanings? I don't think so. 
 
 You have to remember that the OT is wrote in Hebrew, Chaldean, and some Arabic. For the most part, words we use today, will have the same meaning. But in some instances they DON'T. 
 
 Take the word ""kill"" for an example. If you own a Bible dictionary or concordance then it should inform you that the word kill in the Ten Commandments means to commit manslaughter. There is alot more to the actual commentary on this word and it is quite interesting.

"7886","Ok, this makes sense. 
 
 I do think however, that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate, even though as you say, they usually are not. Part of the abortion issue (and the most important part, IMO) is the perception of pregnancy itself. If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing, this is not good. One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing. As Clinton himself once said, abortion should be rare.","I would also like to see women choose and want to have their babies instead of terminating their pregnancies, as long as they are able to handle the responsibilities of having a baby or are able to handle the possibility of passing on those responsibilities to someone else - via adoption, having a relative bring it up, etc. Though I haven't experienced it myself, I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience. However, I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties. Some of these might include:
 
 - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child. This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children. It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare, whereas, if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared, she could be a better mother to those future children.
 
 - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma, whereas, if she secretly got an abortion, she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment.
 
 - Of course, there are the cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother, but I think we mostly agree on those.
 
 I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby, so I believe that women should have the right to choose (at least during the first and second trimester) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process. 
 
 Yes, theoretically, they could put the child up for adoption, but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman, including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child. I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby, but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision. Unfortunately, though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades, there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood (marriage is not always a possibility) . Reduce that stigma and you might reduce the number of abortions.",-0.166666666667,1

"744","The pro-life argument quite plainly revolves around the premise that fetuses are human beings, and therefore have a right to life. However, many (if not all) pro-lifers say that they will allow abortions in the ""extreme cases"" of rape or incest. Now, what does that imply? Rape/incest fetuses aren't human beings, while others are? Pro-lifers say that they don't want the government picking and choosing who has the right to life and who doesn't, but this sounds like picking and choosing to me.
 
 I think this inconsistency effectively nullifies the pro-life argument. Of course, to get rid of the inconsistency, the pro-lifers can bring rape and incest babies into the sphere of protected beings. The result - a horribly unreasonable position I can't suport.","Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5% of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95%, which is better than nothing. After that they can work towards stopping all abortions. It's a step-by-step process. 
 
 I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal. 95% of abortions are a result of consentual sex. We shouldn't cater to the 5% just because they've had a tough situation. I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them, but they do still need to have the baby, whether they give it up for adoption or not. This isn't a horribly unreasonable position. It's just a difficult position. Saying it's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position.

There is absolutely no feeling, no emotion, no thought, no sense of pain. The batch of cells is still an object. They are the very beginnings of the body where the beginnings of the mind (or, for that matter, a soul, if one is of the opinion that a soul must include some sense of mind) are very far off. 
 
 However, unless I am mistaken in the biology of this particular batch of cells, they could potentially develop into an actual person (where, for me, person means not only body but some sense of mind or soul as well). This sense of potential personhood should not be taken lightly. This would not be a case of a woman's right over her own body. This would be the case of deliberately generating living human cells (note: this is not equal to a living person) for medical reasons benefiting a living person. 
 
 In the balance of having some respect for the idea that these cells could potentially become a person (again, still far off from being actual people - i.e. starting to have a mind), I would only condone using such stem cells if it is a case of saving the life of an existing person - be it myself or anyone else.
