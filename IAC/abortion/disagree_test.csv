"7081","You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of ""empirical fact"", this is just not so. I think you should rethink what ""empirical fact"" is. Empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.","So for example if I say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?
 
 I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?
 
 It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.",-1.33333333333,0

 Despite these horrific facts, New Jersey Federal Courts have ruled that Donna Santa Marie cannot sue the doctor, the abortionist, because the infant was not born alive and have cited Roe v.

 Catholic Group Receives 1,092 New Sex Abuse Reports
 By NEELA BANERJEE 
 Published: February 19, 2005
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 - Roman Catholic bishops reported on Friday that they had received 1,092 new accusations of sexual abuse by priests as they released the second annual survey of the church's procedures for handling and preventing such abuse by clergy and employees. 
 
 Kathleen McChesney, executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the overwhelming majority of the accusations, which were made against 756 priests, concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago. Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004, and they were all turned over to the police, Dr. McChesney said. 
 
 The findings were released on Friday by the national conference, which has hired independent auditors to assess the church's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002.
 
 Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $800 million since 1950. Last year alone the costs from settlements, therapy for victims and offenders, and lawyers' fees came to about $139.6 million, according to the report.
 
 The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people, mostly men. Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, based on figures from bishops and religious orders, that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002.
 
 The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward, Dr. McChesney said.
 
 ""We weren't surprised by the numbers because many people are still finding the courage to come forward,"" Dr. McChesney said, ""and the church is in a better place to accept those allegations."" . . .","""The Myth of the Pedophile Priest"":

 Pro-Choice people: Try to understand that a pro-life person dosen't (neccessarily) want to control you, many simply believe in the sanctity of human life at conception. You believe in sanctity of life, but they believe it starts earlier than you do. You must admit that you do not have the answer to the issue of when a fetus converts from just a fetus with human properties to a full fledged human. This is why women that do not want to get pregnant MUST insist on taking the full responsibility of contraception with utmost respect and seriousness. The friends of mine that had abortions were not systematic with their routine as they should have been. More often than not (but not always) it is a big case of ""OOPS."" The risk of pregnancy demands staunch discipline.
 
 Pro-life people, 
 I understand your view on the premis of the fetus being a human life. But you have a bigger problem to address than just the suffering of fetuses. Do you not understand that millions upon millions of children around the world at this very moment in time do not have enough to eat, suffer from disease and are left orphans? An abortion ends the human existence in the womb in a moment, a starving childs suffering can go on for years. (A crisis in Africa right now-- some 1 million orphaned children.) If you happen be a Pro-lifer who is Christian, Jesus said nothing on abortion to my knowledge (ironically he did say woe to pregnant women who are nursing during the end times, LUKE 21:23), however, he was very clear on feeding the hungry and poor MAT 25:35-46: ""I was hungry and you did not take me in...Inasmuch as you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."" Ask yourself, ""What have I done today to follow Jesus' teaching on feeding the hungry?"" Please do all you can do to alleviate the pain and suffering of children that are in the world before you expend your energies to champion the cause of unborn children in the womb.","Gennipher,
 1. In regard to your friends' actions...do you agree with abortion being a last resort ""birth control"" when contraceptives or humans fail?
 
 2. Why does being against abortion exclude one from being against the starvation and hunger of children?

 Would you ask the same of an environmentalist? Would you ask him to pay for buying the all of the rainforests he hopes to save? The scientific research? etc. Would you ask this of any other cause except the abortion one? This is faulty reasoning. No one who supports any cause is expected to pay for the entirety of that cause.

 I would guess that you judge actions all the time without necessarily knowing what is in a person's heart. That is, there are certain things you can say are wrong actions without knowing the fullness of what is in someone's heart or mind. You made that judgment about rape. Who are you to judge that the rapist wasn't craving affection, maybe he was mistreated by his mother, etc. No matter the reason he did this it remains wrong. Maybe someone murdered someone else out of anger, revenge, to further himself. It is still wrong no matter the reason. We can judge abortion in the same manner. Is the act wrong? Yes. Are the circumstances contributory? Possibly, but this does not change the wrong.","I understand your points... all I am saying is that these are issues that come up.. not saying that these are the ONLY issues... I'm not judging that the rapist in the example wasn't craving affection or anything like that... I'm not judging anyone on that one... my point was that if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, she has become pregnant through no choice of her own. But I am not about to take the side of a rapist... I don't care how abused they were. When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape, I didn't mean that they wouldn't otherwise... but think if you were a woman and were raped, and became pregnant by someone you didn't know or know anything about...

 One cannot demand that their local store stock a certain item just because it is available at another store in the area.","Is this not illegal?
 
 Both federal and state laws prohibit businesses from denying public accommodation to citizens on the basis of race, color, religion or national original. The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to ""full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.""  
 
 If the reason a pharmacy kook is refusing service based on their belief that doing so is contrary to their religious beliefs (or that they are supporting a behavior that is considered bad in their religion), then is it not clearly illegal?
 
 The grey area is of course if they lie and say it's not religion, it's just ""ethics"", or ""whim"". In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)
 
 Up to the courts I suppose. Personally I would feel discriminated against, and ""morality"" is easily linked to religion (especially in these cases).

In my case, I have a moral code outside of my control. I have to be accountable to that.

I'm sure that it was never meant to be presented as a realistic scenario - that was not the point. The point was to try to make pro-life people admit that the baby is more worthy of consideration than the newly fertilized zygote. Your example of choosing between ones mother and a stranger is equally unrealistic for most of us but does not address the same type of question (the question in that case being how much worth one places on personal connections in deciding the worth of a person).
 
 There are occasional situations in life where one is faced with choosing between two awful choices and one can only choose the lesser of two evils. Those type of situations can be quite interesting since they reveal to us our priorities and details of our moral reasoning. I remember being comfronted with the too-many-people-on-a-lifeboat scenario (so how does one decide who lives and dies) during comfirmation years back - again to force us to explore our moral reasoning.
 
 Cthulhu's scenario may be an unrealistic one but would force someone who is pro-life to consider the relative worth of the baby vs zygote. It may be a very uncomfortable question (all of the lesser-of-two-evils questions are) but can be quite revealing. Given that introduction, if you or other pro-life people were faced with that awful choice, would you:
 1) Consider both so exactly equally worthy that you would indeed be frozen in indecision, or possibly decide based on chance (a flip of a coin)
 2) Choose one over the other based on moral considerations

 Hitlers or Helpers?
 
 Which one are you?
 
 Hitler defined the Jews as nonhumans, as parasites, so he did execute them. He did. He exercised his freedom of choice, imposed his will upon them, and had them cleaned out from the country. He had them removed, scraped away.
 
 A helper is someone who stands alongside another in assistance, and protection. 
 
 So, which are you? What kind of a man are you? 
 
 Do you have the guts to stand up and defend the weak and helpless? 
 Or, have you redefined human life so that you can justify killing it?
 
 Do you have the guts to be men and stand for what is right?
 Or, is sitting in your couch, watching TV, easier to do than be good men?
 
 Do you have the strength to curtail your own sensual desires?
 Or do you seek women for your own pleasure, and then destroy the lives formed in the long because they are inconvenient?
 
 Or, let's see where you stand?
 
 Are you a Hitler or a helper?
 
 
 - REAL MEN stand up for the innocent even at the cost of their lives. 
 
 - REAL MEN do what is right, even when it's inconvenient. 
 
 - REAL MEN recognize that there are things greater than themselves, like righteousness, integrity, the need to protect women, the obligation to provide for children, and they live their lives according. 
 
 
 
 - non men get women pregnant after a tryst of satisfying their own desires, and then the emotional burden on the woman to destroy the life within her. 
 
 - non men advocate killing the weak and defenseless. 
 
 - non men hide behind the sinful and asinine intellectual arguments of liberals and the ungodly in order to justify the destruction of life so they might be self-assured, and self comforted. 
 
 
 
 - I'm a real man because I stand against unrighteousness - even when it is extremely difficult. 
 
 - I'm a real man because I protect the innocent and the weak. 
 
 - I'm a real man because I stand against other males who seek to justify killing the weak and innocent. 
 
 - I'm a real man because I advocate the production and preservation of life. 
 
 - I'm a real man because I do not set the mother against the child. 
 
 - I am a real man because I don't redefine life in emotionally neutral and dry intellectual terms to ease my own conscience. 
 
 
 I'm a helper working against Hitlers!","If this is the only way you define manhood, then congratulations. You know passion is a tricky thing. It can bring great gains in society, great achievement. It can also bring horrible horrible things, like this writing. You are making a strawman, if you create your own opposition and make them absurd, then it is surely absurd. 
 
 You know, here's what I think about abortion. It doesn't matter to me. I don't really care either way. That being said, it is safer to legalize, it is better to regulate it, and ultimately, as men, we don't get the choice, do we?
 
 The day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision, you stand up and tell me what a real man is. Those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do, more than you could ever do. Don't stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position.

 Whether youa re talking war, abortion, whatever, people become complacent. 1000, or 10,000, or 100,000 dead mens nothing. Abortion means nothing.

It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book ""Forbidden Grief"" by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion.

 The following excerpt is from:
 http://abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2a-pain.html
 
 ""Sir Albert Lilley, widely considered the ""Father of Fetology"", and unabashedly pro-life (as anyone with his vast knowledge of fetal development should be) makes some remarkable statements about fetal pain in an interview he conducted for the book The Tiniest Humans.
 
 Question: In the case of an 8- to-10-week fetus, if you apply pressure will it tend to try to get out of the way?
 
 Answer: Normally it would be extremely difficult, apart from putting a foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure, but with a fetus at that maturity you have a very small fetus in a larger capsule of fluid. However, as the famous work of Dr. Davenport Hooker shows, in his many thousands of feet of film, babies at this maturity are responsive to touch.
 
 The fetus also responds violently to painful stimuli-needle puncture and injection of cold or of hypertonic solutions- stimuli which you and I find painful, children will tell you are painful, and the neonate, to judge from his responses, finds painful.
 ---
 I have been told by advocates of abortion that we have no proof that the fetus actually feels pain. Strictly, they are quite correct. Pain is a peculiarly personal and subjective experience and there is no biochemical or physiological test we can do to tell that anyone is in pain - a phenomenon which makes it very easy to bear other people's pain stoically, which is an important point for obstetricians to remember. By the same token we lack any proof that animals feel pain. However, to judge from their responses, it seems charitable to assume they do. Were this not so there would be no point in having an organization like the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and I for one would be unhappy to think we would withhold from the human fetus a charitable consideration we were prepared to extend to animals.
 
 Question: The question, then, of pain felt by the fetus - it is your personal opinion, I gather from what you say in your paper, that in effect the fetus does feel pain?
 
 Answer: I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful. Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation, but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him.""
 
 The following excerpt is from:
 http://www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html
 
 ""Dr. Glover's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking. Sir Albert W. Liley, the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand, had no doubt, on the basis of objective evidence, that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain. In 1963, Dr. Liley, the founder of fetology, developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus. According to Liley, the fetus feels pain as early as three months. In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions, he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain. During the actual surgical procedure, the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication. Dr. Margaret Liley, wife and assistant to her husband, and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right, remarks in her well-known book, Modern Motherhood: 
 When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb, they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would. But they soon learned that he would. By no means a 'vegetable' as he has so often been pictured, the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt, and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib. 
 
 In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage, (in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette), Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971: ""When this procedure is done, there is little doubt that the fetus, in fact, feels what is done to it."" In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain, published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. K. Annand, a Harvard physiologist, stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks. 
 
 In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic, Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation, which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion. If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to ""unimaginable acts of violence,"" they write, such as ""dismemberment, salt-induced osmotic shock, or surgical extirpation,"" how can it balk at fetal experimentation, most forms of which are incomparably more benign. 
 
 Fetal pain, of course, is a matter of fact, not ideology. Science, of course, should be based on fact, not political correctness. We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime. We are only too sensitive about pain, inconvenience, and possibly offending someone. Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not, in general, extend to the unborn. Are we inconsistent in our war against pain? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture? 
 
 The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain. Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level. Of the two, as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred, the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear. The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering. The suffering in one's soul that can arise from humiliation, guilt, despair, and terror, are formidable. An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp. A soldier would rather risk injury and even death, than suffer the shame of dishonor. A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin. Defeat, dishonor, disgrace, as a rule, are far more devastating than physical pain. 
 There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong (shame) or being recklessly immoral (disgrace) or being purposely obtuse (humiliation) that is more acute than physical pain. Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent. Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame, disgrace, and humiliation. Because of that, they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels. To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them. They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology. 
 
 Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way, like death and life, fall and redemption. The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain. Birth and redemption both demand pain. Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain. But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce. We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering. We thought we could eliminate physical suffering, but brought about spiritual torment. The abortion issue, like an ellipse, has two foci: one is the birth of the child (which is accompanied by pain); the other, the rebirth of the pro-abortionist (which is accompanied by suffering). Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant.""

 Let's get it on!","Ditto! With that in mind...
 
 I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them, for reasons described above. Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.
 
 Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is ""Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception"". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: ""It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms"". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.
 
 The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?
 
 Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?
 
 Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?",-2,0

 -- exhaustion (weariness common from first weeks) 
 -- altered appetite and senses of taste and smell 
 -- nausea and vomiting (50% of women, first trimester) 
 -- heartburn and indigestion 
 -- constipation 
 -- weight gain

 -- increased urination and incontinence 
 -- bleeding gums 
 -- pica

 -- swelling of joints, leg cramps, joint pain 
 -- difficulty sitting, standing in later pregnancy 
 -- inability to take regular medications 
 -- shortness of breath 
 -- higher blood pressure 
 -- hair loss 
 -- tendency to anemia 
 -- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities 
 -- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease (pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women, and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases) 
 -- extreme pain on delivery 
 -- hormonal mood changes, including normal post-partum depression 
 -- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period (exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required, sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover)

 -- stretch marks (worse in younger women) 
 -- loose skin 
 -- permanent weight gain or redistribution 
 -- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness 
 -- pelvic floor disorder (occurring in as many as 35% of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50% of elderly former child-bearers, associated with urinary and rectal incontinence, discomfort and reduced quality of life) 
 -- changes to breasts 
 -- varicose veins 
 -- scarring from episiotomy or c-section 
 -- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body (all of these are downplayed by women, because the culture values youth and beauty) 
 -- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids 
 -- loss of dental and bone calcium (cavities and osteoporosis)","Hmm . . . a lot of these could also be brought on by sitting in a chair for long periods of time trying to make sweeping online statements that pregnancy is always harmful and trying to back it up with either temporary issues, worst-case scenarios that rarely happen, or things for which it is debatable whether or not it is truly 'harmful.'",-1.57142857143,0

 As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.
 
 However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.
 
 Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk. 
 Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.

When you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?
 
 ALITO: Senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...
 
 SCHUMER: But it had no exceptions. You didn't make that...
 
 ALITO: It was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...
 
 SCHUMER: There was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. Correct? It just said the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And, yesterday, you didn't argue me when I mentioned that without exception.
 
 ALITO: I don't recall your using the words without exception. SCHUMER: I think I did.

 SCHUMER: If you believe...
 
 ALITO: Could I just answer that question? It's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.
 
 SCHUMER: No, I understand that. But it was a very strong statement. It didn't talk about any exceptions at all. And the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?
 
 ALITO: I think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...
 
 SCHUMER: Knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? No ands, ifs or buts, is my words.
 
 ALITO: What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case...
 
 SCHUMER: But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.
 
 ALITO: That's correct. But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case.
 
 SCHUMER: I understand. But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?
 
 ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.
 
 SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?
 
 ALITO: I was not involved in...
 
 SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement.
 
 ALITO: And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.
 
 SCHUMER: I understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but I don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions. Not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn't see any of those in your job application.

"1571","To answer your question, yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone's health, not just women's. Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex.
 
 Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex. Even if she does not contract any STD, there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer, HPV(human papolloma virus), and having intercource. Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins, and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners.
 
 Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis. Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse, and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin.
 
 Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent. Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent, as well as less domestic or partner abuse.
 
 However, I don't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem. Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle. Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples. Furthermore, there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works. Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education, including abstinence and contraception, is the most effective, according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the Institute of Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association. All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education.
 
 The Institute of Medicine recommends ""Congress, as well as other federal, state and local policymakers, eliminate the requirements that public funds be used for abstinence-only education and that states and local school districts implement and continue to support age-appropriate comprehensive sex education.""

 Catholic Group Receives 1,092 New Sex Abuse Reports
 By NEELA BANERJEE 
 Published: February 19, 2005
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 - Roman Catholic bishops reported on Friday that they had received 1,092 new accusations of sexual abuse by priests as they released the second annual survey of the church's procedures for handling and preventing such abuse by clergy and employees. 
 
 Kathleen McChesney, executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the overwhelming majority of the accusations, which were made against 756 priests, concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago. Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004, and they were all turned over to the police, Dr. McChesney said. 
 
 The findings were released on Friday by the national conference, which has hired independent auditors to assess the church's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002.
 
 Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $800 million since 1950. Last year alone the costs from settlements, therapy for victims and offenders, and lawyers' fees came to about $139.6 million, according to the report.
 
 The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people, mostly men. Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, based on figures from bishops and religious orders, that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002.
 
 The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward, Dr. McChesney said.
 
 ""We weren't surprised by the numbers because many people are still finding the courage to come forward,"" Dr. McChesney said, ""and the church is in a better place to accept those allegations."" . . .","These two issues (abortion and sexual abuse among priests) are completely unrelated. The problems in one area have no bearing on the credibility the church has in the other. This is a classic case of a non-sequitur.",-2.16666666667,0

(The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.) The study didn't address causes, and only noted the correlation, but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion.

"2147","I don't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it's a wonderful snuggly thing that's just the best thing in the world. Even if you want a baby, it's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from. If you don't want a baby and are being forced to go through it, it's unbearable.
 
 . . . . this life-threatening condition [pregnancy] that is always  physically harmful.","Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as ""unbelievably"" hard to go through, or a ""life threatening condition"" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying ""some"" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not ""unbelievably hard to go through""--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you. :)

"739","That's kind of true. The Roman Catholic church is considered not credible based on it's support of lies, not because they archaically force their priests to act like they don't want some, then a significant percentage of the preists fondle and abuse their flock as a result of 
 a. being sexually repressed by their mythical laws
 b. close proximity to young kids 
 c. in a position of power/trust among kids
 d. for all the other average reasons people do things like that.
 
 Kind of reminds us all that made-up laws and made-up law enforcement lead to nothing. Reality however, where we do have and enforce laws, actually has meaning.
 
 The conclusion is, yes indeed, the catholic church is unfit to rule anything, and anyone looking to a house of superstision for answers to life's real problems, is not firing on all cylinders. I mean really, we could sift through some chicken guts and find the answers according to some religious shaman..no difference really.
 
 -Mach","Mach,
 Let me first say that you may be dealing more with chicken brains than in chicken guts in light of your most recent post. But if you can find in reading chicken guts, the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church, then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer.
 
 The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women (in your words they do not seek to act like they don't ""want some""). They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love. They are not pretending that they do not exist. If they don't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood.
 
 Secondly, there is much basis to the Catholic Church's teachings on celibacy. It is not without foundation. These are not made up laws with made up enforcement.
 
 Thirdly, if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you:
 
 Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children?
 
 If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction?
 
 If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children?
 
 And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate?
 
 Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.",-2,0
