If this is the case, then it cannot be immoral for me to tell a person that I wish they had been aborted. After all, I am not wishing death upon them, but only nonexistence. Wishing death would be immoral, because it would be wishing something bad upon a person, but wishing they had never been born cannot be immoral, because according to abortion advocates, there is nothing bad about not being born. If, however, it is in fact immoral to wish a person had never been born, then by the same logic abortion must also be immoral. Why, then, do we generally feel that ""I wish you had never been born"" is such an awful thing to tell a person? The answer speaks for itself.

"8630","2. By HELEN EPSTEIN
EVEN as the United States Agency for International Development sends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food to developing countries, a strange but important nutritional problem is being overlooked: The children of women who suffer from severe stress and poverty sometimes seem to give up and refuse to eat. Studies suggest that this stems from maternal detachment Â— the breakdown of emotional connection between traumatized mothers and their children.
..... Sally Grantham-McGregor, a child health researcher working in Jamaica, demonstrated that teaching poor mothers the basic techniques of mothering Â— holding and playing, and communicating with smiles, gestures and questions Â— could help their ailing children achieve remarkable developmental gains. And these gains were much greater than those that could have been achieved with food and medical care alone.
Today, Unicef and the World Health Organization agree that counseling should be an important part of food aid programs. Once feeding programs are in place, it costs very little to train community health workers. One organization, Play Therapy Africa, which runs feeding and counseling centers in Ethiopia, is training aid workers in these methods in 50 centers. The one-time expense of $278,000 Â— the cost of training and monitoring the health workers Â— is a pittance compared with the millions of dollars spent on food alone.
Unfortunately, most aid economists overlook counseling. When the journal Lancet recently reviewed strategies to reduce malnutrition, these methods werenÂ’t mentioned at all.
Vulnerable children require more than food and medicine; they need affection. To nurture them, we need to nurture the mothers on whom their lives depend.","WouldnÂ’t it be wonderful if every woman in the world didnÂ’t have to be so alone, without a single helping hand, when she becomes a mother?",1.4,2
"6287","[...]Assuming abortion is justified as one means of acheiving the goal of population control, is it outrageous to consider 'removing' non-productive members of our society as another means of achieving the same goal?","To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.
 
 Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted).

 points
 
 1) child birth is dangerious, deadly and painful. many women have died during child labor. due to our bi-pedalism the female hip is much smaller than it should be making it most of the time impossible to give birth (thus a c-section) how can you force someone to carry around a child they do not want for 9 months? 
 
 2) rape 
 
 3) if you try to stop it, you won't. you will just put it back on the street (much like drugs) doctors will be preforming back alley abortions. 
 
 4) if your mother doesnt' want you who will? people say oh adoption is in such high demand. true: however its not because of a lack of children its because of buerocratic XXXXXXXX. the gov. doesn't want to be responsible for child abuse so they over screen adoption parents and make it diffucult to get a child. the cost is astronomical. 
 
 5) overpopulation is a problem.
 
 note: religion should not influence your decision in law making. only in personal moral decisions.","This is a pretty touchy issue, and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense... while I don't personally agree with abortion, I don't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do. The way I see it, is that it's their body, their life, they are the ones who will be affected by their decision. I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.",3.4,2

 Life begins at the point of conception. No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.","Hi Joe, welcome to the forum.

 I do understand that biologically a fetus is a human being. I've never contested that. I don't necessarily agree with abortion in all cases, at all.. I do know that sometimes it medically becomes the only realistic option to the mother. (I've been through that). But in cases where the woman uses what I think are trivial reasons, such as they don't want to lose their figure, or they have to much to do before they have a child, I don't agree with it. A lot of my aquaintances have done it for those reasons, and that seems really irresponsible to me... 
 In my opinion, it should be made an option for medical reasons, not the little trivial reasons like my friends used.. but even then to me it doesn't seem right... 
 After what I just went through, I got a first hand look at how horrible it really is, and even though I knew that medically that was the only choice, morally and emotionally it still doesn't seem like it should have been that way. Maybe it's because I didn't want to do it, but knew I had to, as opposed to someone choosing to have it done, but I almost wish it hadn't been an option, because then you don't have to make that choice. It's a very hard thing to deal with, no matter what the reasons behind it, and knowing you can't change it.. but I do know if something like this happens again, it won't be an option to me, no matter how many doctors tell me otherwise.

"7590","to me, a fetus wheither or not is a human being at the very early stages shouldn't matter since the mother has to take care of it anyway; be it now or (if she decides to keep it) later on when i grows up. if a mother can make choices for a child, she can do it even earlier than that when the child is still a fetus.
 
 i think its all up to the women who are with child. they should be able to have the choice wheither or not they want to get rid of their child. 
 
 if it were me, I only have one reason where i would consider abortion; when i just am not able to raise a child. other then that, i'm against abortion.

 The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.
 
 Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.
 
 Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.

"779","Third, the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship. This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration, also echoed in McDonagh's thesis. Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child. 
 
 The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger. McDonagh's view is even worse. She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense. 
 
 This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson's illustration. What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that? And what would we think of her if she did? 
 
 Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless. This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents. They have consistently ruled, for example, that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted. 
 
 If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life (through abortion) before it is born, how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he's born? Remember, Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. If her argument works to justify abortion, it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child. After all, a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn.","This seems to be the central argument: the article continues to give many examples of moral disapproval of neglecting or murdering your children. However, it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb (it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions).
 
 We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child, or anyone we have parental responsibility for. On the other hand, if a person gives their child up for adoption then they cannot be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents.

"8852","South Dakota's Legislature: Human Life Begins at Conception 
 
 Susan Jones, CNSNews.com
 Friday, Feb. 27, 2004 
 
 The South Dakota House on Thursday joined the state Senate in passing a bill that says human life begins at conception - something that would outlaw all abortions in South Dakota, except in cases where the mother's health or life were endangered. 
 Pro-abortion groups called the bill ""a direct assault on South Dakotans' rights,"" and pro-life advocates see it as a way of directly challenging the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
 
 The bill's main sponsor, Republican state Rep. Matt McCaulley, called it the ""strongest, cleanest pro-life legislation"" passed by a state legislature since 1973. 
 
 Equal Protection
 
 He and other supporters say unborn babies deserve equal protection under the 14th Amendment, and they say the state is within its rights to expand the definition of ""persons"" to include unborn babies.
 
 ""If this is the case that goes to the Supreme Court to get them to overturn Roe versus Wade, so be it,"" a wire report quoted McCaulley as saying.
 
 South Dakota's pro-life Republican Gov. Mike Rounds has not yet said whether he would sign the bill. He has until March 12 to make up his mind.
 
 The bill makes it a crime to perform abortions. The penalties for doing so include up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, unless a mother's life is in danger. The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest. 
 
 McCaulley estimated that about 800 abortions are performed every year in South Dakota.
 
 'Be Very Worried'
 
 Every American who ""values a woman's right to choose"" should be worried, said Kate Michelman, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a press release.
 
 Michelman said the bill, if upheld by the courts, could endanger the health of women, send doctors to prison for ""doing what is in the best medical interests of their patients,"" and insert government into personal decisions to the point where some widely used forms of birth control might be banned.
 
 ""The anti-choice movement has not been shy about its two-pronged strategy for overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Michelman said. 
 
 She described the strategy as passing bills like the one in South Dakota, then forcing them into the court system and ""hoping that George Bush has the opportunity to put new justices on the Supreme Court who will take the opportunity that these bills provide them to take away reproductive freedom.""
 
 NARAL Pro-Choice America describes itself as the ""leading national advocate of personal privacy and a woman's right to choose.""","YES!! Go South Dakota!! emoticon_xbouncer",4.2,2
