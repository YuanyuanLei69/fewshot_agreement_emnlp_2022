 FOR millions of girls around the world, motherhood comes too early. Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and their children are more likely to die in infancy. One reliable way to solve this problem is through education. The more affordable it is, the longer girls will stay in school and delay pregnancy.
 
 I advise a nonprofit foundation called Innovation for Poverty Action that focuses on keeping girls in school. (We aren't alone; lots of other terrific organizations do this, too.) In a pilot program we ran in Kenya a few years ago, around 5,000 sixth-grade girls in 163 primary schools were given a $6 school uniform free. If they stayed in school, they received a second uniform after 18 months. The dropout rate over the next three years decreased by a third, to 12 percent, and the pregnancy rate fell to 8 percent from 12 percent. Of every 50 girls given free uniforms, then, three stayed in school as a result of the uniforms alone, and two delayed pregnancy.
 
 The benefits of secondary education are even greater. In the same group of Kenyan girls, 50 percent of those who dropped out after primary school had a child within two years, but only 8 percent who went on to secondary school became pregnant in that same period.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every girl and every woman were valued enough to educate, to make sure that girls do not become pregnant before their bodies are ready for the traumatic event of pregnancy and chilldbirth?",2

"25901","A baby may look helpless. It canÂ’t walk, talk, think symbolically or overhaul the nationÂ’s banking system. Yet as social emulsifiers go, nothing can beat a happily babbling baby. A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd. A toothless smile here, a musical squeal there, and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees.
In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human. Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview, a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals, including a willingness to share, to cooperate with strangers, to relax oneÂ’s guard, uncurl oneÂ’s lip and widen oneÂ’s pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me, myself and mine.
As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book, Â“Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding,Â” which will be published by Harvard University Press in April, human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing. Chimpanzee and gorilla mothers are capable of rearing their offspring pretty much through their own powers, but human mothers are not.","http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/science/03angi.html.
IÂ’ve had three children, which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants. Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence. Â“No! No! No!Â” are the bywords of a two-year-old. Â“No! I wonÂ’t! And you canÂ’t make me!Â”",2
"9867","1. By AMY GROSSMAN
EVERY minute, a woman somewhere in the world dies in childbirth or from complications of pregnancy.
But there is an inexpensive medicine that could save a great many of these womenÂ’s lives Â— misoprostol.
Misoprostol is a generic drug originally developed to treat ulcers, but itÂ’s predominately used off-label for obstetrics. When a mother takes it immediately after delivery, it can effectively stop the leading cause of maternal death in most developing countries: postpartum hemorrhage or excessive bleeding. WhatÂ’s more, itÂ’s an easy-to-take tablet with a long shelf life, so itÂ’s suitable for the vast majority of women who deliver at home, in remote villages, far from skilled medical care.","WouldnÂ’t it be wonderful if women everywhere would not bleed to death after childbirth?",2

(Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.)

 There is no way to argue out of the fact that at 8 weeks (and remember that pregnancy is calculated in weeks which begins at the start of the last menstrual period, so the embryo has only been established and growing for 6 weeks) the embryo looks human, has developed reflexes and functioning brain tissue, and very importantly has a fully operational circulatory system, i.e. it's heart is beating.
 
 Now people can argue how aware the embryo is at 6, 7, 8, or 20 weeks or how much pain they can feel, but with out intervention that baby has a 70 plus percent chance of survival and WILL be a human being someday. Those are FACTS that cannot be argued. 
 
 The goal of people who are pro-life are not fighting to take rights away from women. They are fighting to GAIN rights for unborn children.
 
 With so many methods of birth control available today for men and women that are affordable and simple to use to PREVENT pregnancy, I don't know why women still choose the option of abortion which is painful, expensive and emotional.

 And all dishonor to those vicious attackers like Bill O'Reilly who have egged on the kind of violence that finally murdered Dr. Tiller. And who have blasphemously invoked the name of God to justify these incitements to murder.","On Faith: Murder is Murder and Abortion is Not - Arthur Waskow",2

 ""Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; 
 ensure justice for those who are perishing."" Proverbs 31:8
 Also...
 
 Exodus 21
 22 ""If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
 
 1) If a woman gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury--i.e. the baby lives without harm, 
 then a fine results to compensate for the assault.
 
 2) If a woman gives birth prematurely, and the baby dies, then the assailant is to be given the death penalty. This point is HUGE!!! What God is saying here is that the value and worth of an adult man is equal to the value and worth of an unborn fetus who was young enough, or injured enough, to die. God equates the loss of an unborn baby as the loss of a life, for He says, ""you are to take life for life,..."" This point cannot be emphasized too strongly. God considers the unborn baby alive, and the loss of that life is considered murder. This murder is punishable with the death penalty. This verse demonstrates three truths:
 a) The unborn's life is equivalent in value to an adult's life in God's sight
 b) This also outlines God's Law against criminal feticide. 
 c) The killing of the unborn is murder

EVERY minute, a woman somewhere in the world dies in childbirth or from complications of pregnancy.
But there is an inexpensive medicine that could save a great many of these womenÂ’s lives Â— misoprostol.
Misoprostol is a generic drug originally developed to treat ulcers, but itÂ’s predominately used off-label for obstetrics. When a mother takes it immediately after delivery, it can effectively stop the leading cause of maternal death in most developing countries: postpartum hemorrhage or excessive bleeding. WhatÂ’s more, itÂ’s an easy-to-take tablet with a long shelf life, so itÂ’s suitable for the vast majority of women who deliver at home, in remote villages, far from skilled medical care.","WouldnÂ’t it be wonderful if women everywhere would not bleed to death after childbirth?",2

"32021","Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop
 
 Nov. 22, 2009
 
 PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday.
 
 The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family.
 
 ""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.
 
 Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him ""that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,"" particularly on abortion.

I do think anti-choicers value both the same, even if one exists without the other. In their case I would ask them if they value a person who was recently deceased, where the cells of the body are still living, but there is no mental existence. I also beleive you are right in saying most pro-choicers do not place as high a value on a foetus (which is not a person) as they do on the woman (who is a fully developed person). There is not as much of an empathy toward the foetus as it is not a person, and not as valuable as the woman.

 You have two tables, one with a small test tube which you know holds a microscopically small living zygote, and another table with a live baby.

 My assumption is the scientific assumption that our minds are determined by the functioning of the brain and by its state of development and health. Of course, one could argue the religious view of a soul external to our bodies determining at least part of our mental existence, but there is no evidence to support any such religious view - it is all taken on faith. 
 
 Where abortion rights are concerned, separation of Church and state would not allow for women's rights to be restricted based on a religious argument.","No disagreements.
 
 Something left out (probably because it was assumed), is memory.
 
 What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity. 
 To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity. 
 
 There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required.
 It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person.
 Of course, others will disagree.
 
 Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.
 
 In the case of a chimera, two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes, would have to blend into one person/soul. (No, most chimeras are not schizophrenic).
 
 I believe an integral part of [personal identity<mental existence<personhood] is memory. Whether it is short term, or long term, without memory there is no sense of self. (I may be stating the obvious, but you never know.)

By DENISE GRADY
DODOMA, Tanzania &#8212; Lying side by side on a narrow bed, talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets.
But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward, and between the moments of laughter, Sarah Jonas, 18, and Mwanaidi Swalehe, 17, had an inescapable air of sadness. Pregnant at 16, both had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days. Their babies had died, and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers: an internal wound called a fistula, which left them incontinent and soaked in urine....
Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.
One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/he...4hospital.html",2

 FOR millions of girls around the world, motherhood comes too early. Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and their children are more likely to die in infancy. One reliable way to solve this problem is through education. The more affordable it is, the longer girls will stay in school and delay pregnancy.
 
 I advise a nonprofit foundation called Innovation for Poverty Action that focuses on keeping girls in school. (We aren't alone; lots of other terrific organizations do this, too.) In a pilot program we ran in Kenya a few years ago, around 5,000 sixth-grade girls in 163 primary schools were given a $6 school uniform free. If they stayed in school, they received a second uniform after 18 months. The dropout rate over the next three years decreased by a third, to 12 percent, and the pregnancy rate fell to 8 percent from 12 percent. Of every 50 girls given free uniforms, then, three stayed in school as a result of the uniforms alone, and two delayed pregnancy.
 
 The benefits of secondary education are even greater. In the same group of Kenyan girls, 50 percent of those who dropped out after primary school had a child within two years, but only 8 percent who went on to secondary school became pregnant in that same period.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every girl and every woman were valued enough to educate, to make sure that girls do not become pregnant before their bodies are ready for the traumatic event of pregnancy and chilldbirth?",2

 WHEN diseases like swine flu hit, pregnant women are especially at risk. And yet we know surprisingly little about how to treat them. In its guidelines for the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that pregnant women infected or at high risk for infection should take the recommended adult dosage: ""Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication"" to taking the drugs, because the benefits of treatment ""likely outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use.""
 
 But we don't know whether this is true. Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them. It is perfectly possible that the standard adult dose of antivirals will not work in the pregnant body.
 
 Pregnancy acts as a wild card when it comes to medication. Changes in blood flow, digestion, kidney function and enzymatic activity alter the ways that drugs act on the body. There is almost no data on how antivirals function during pregnancy, and the same is true for many other drugs on the market.
 
 The consequences are potentially profound. One of the antibiotics used for treating exposure to anthrax is metabolized so quickly by the pregnant body that no dose, no matter how large, is likely to be effective. If the threat of widespread anthrax attacks after 9/11 had been realized, pregnant women and their babies would have faced disastrous consequences. We should not make the same mistake in planning for the possible reemergence of swine flu in the fall.
 
 One pregnant woman in America has already died from the flu. Although other health problems complicated her illness, her death is a reminder that we need to understand how to medicate mothers-to-be. Research should be done now, while pregnant women are already taking antivirals. Studying blood samples from as few as two dozen women would get us a long way toward determining whether the standard dose is effective.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if, in this male-centered world, drugs were designed to be women-friendly, especially pregnant women-friendly?",2

By DENISE GRADY
DODOMA, Tanzania &#8212; Lying side by side on a narrow bed, talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets.
But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward, and between the moments of laughter, Sarah Jonas, 18, and Mwanaidi Swalehe, 17, had an inescapable air of sadness. Pregnant at 16, both had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days. Their babies had died, and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers: an internal wound called a fistula, which left them incontinent and soaked in urine....
Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.
One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/he...4hospital.html",2

"32711","Society's willingness to impose on women alone the sacrifice required by laws restricting abortion, unique within the landscape of Anglo-American law, may well reflect a deeply held traditional view of the differences in character of the sexes. While we might not impose selflessness and virtuous behavior on a man....some may find it less of a contradiction to impose such virtue on a woman because of the traditional view of her nature. But to impose virtue on ANY person demeans that person's individual worth. It is no more acceptable when the person is a woman than a man. There should be no 'woman's exception' to our traditional regard for individualism and autonomy. As long as these values remain at the core of our legal system, there is thus a powerful case for the conclusion that laws prohibiting abortion--even IF the fetus is regarded as a person--deny women the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all by the 14th amendment. And if this is so, then perhaps the Roe decision, by gratuitously insisting that the fetus cannot be deemed a person, needlessly insulted and alienated those for whom the view that the fetus is a person represents a fundamental article of faith or a bedrock personal committment. Perhaps as Yale Law School Dean Guido Calabresi has suggested, the Roe opinion for no good reason said to a large and politically active group ""[y]our metaphysics are not part of our Constitution.""

 If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations, then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority. 
 
 I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of ""treat others as you would have yourself be treated"". When, as children, we were scolded ""How would you like it if ..."" that is a tactic of teaching this rule. For those who are religious (which I only marginally, occasionally and hesitatingly am), even Jesus stated ""Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you."" in the Sermon on the Mount talk (as quoted by ShadowPikachu). Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule, which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality.","Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.
 
 The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion ""I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else"" or ""I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else"".

 There is no way to argue out of the fact that at 8 weeks (and remember that pregnancy is calculated in weeks which begins at the start of the last menstrual period, so the embryo has only been established and growing for 6 weeks) the embryo looks human, has developed reflexes and functioning brain tissue, and very importantly has a fully operational circulatory system, i.e. it's heart is beating.
 
 Now people can argue how aware the embryo is at 6, 7, 8, or 20 weeks or how much pain they can feel, but with out intervention that baby has a 70 plus percent chance of survival and WILL be a human being someday. Those are FACTS that cannot be argued. 
 
 The goal of people who are pro-life are not fighting to take rights away from women. They are fighting to GAIN rights for unborn children.

Thus, because God is the one killing people, the act of killing that would normally be immoral becomes moral.

So often, this debate is phrased in terms of the mother's rights vs those of the fetus, but we often forget (including myself) that other people can also be deeply affected by abortion decisions - including the family which might lose a mother.
 
 I would also generally agree that the doctor can often best say what type of health risk exists. Even there, though, the doctor him/herself would have to have some level of judgement about what level of risk is ""acceptable"" and what isn't. Ultimately, someone has to make that decision.

 You are told that one of them will be destroyed and you have just two seconds to decide which, or both will be destroyed. Without a seconds thought I would immediately point in the direction of the zygote, and save the life of the baby.
 
 Extreme pro-lifers on the otherhand would probably end up killing the baby or both via indecision and inability to make a choice in just 2 seconds. That's the morality of pro-life for you: the inability to realise that the chemical reactions that happen when a sperm meets an egg do not define a human person.
 
 Am I wrong? I don't believe so. The sperm meeting the egg is a really random point to decide the emergance of a human person. Why pick that point specifically?","Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote. The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose.

 I find it truly insulting that this great nation, which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right. If we put aside the bible, the commandments, and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders, what argument is left? 
 The Christian right will say that all life is precious, but obviously there are tiers. An unborn, unwanted, and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother. Who cares if she was raped? Who cares if she was the victim of incest? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- ""My preacher says it's wrong!""
 Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control, but it failed, so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted, and even worse, as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control, her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy. But if these ""pro-lifers"" have their way, she will be forced to have the child, and raise it.
 Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption. One must wonder, though, if adoptive families were so abundant, why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded, which means of course, that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines, you will not recieve a child.

"4427","It sure is funny how many times the ""pro-lifers"" claim a victory- and yet that victory is quickly overturned by the supreme authority in this country- which is not the senate, not the president, it is the COURT.
 I find it truly insulting that this great nation, which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right. If we put aside the bible, the commandments, and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders, what argument is left? 
 The Christian right will say that all life is precious, but obviously there are tiers. An unborn, unwanted, and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother. Who cares if she was raped? Who cares if she was the victim of incest? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- ""My preacher says it's wrong!""
 Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control, but it failed, so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted, and even worse, as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control, her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy. But if these ""pro-lifers"" have their way, she will be forced to have the child, and raise it.
 Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption. One must wonder, though, if adoptive families were so abundant, why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded, which means of course, that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines, you will not recieve a child. Single parents (no matter the income) homosexuals, any person who does not subscribe to christianity is immediately disqualified!

Of course, one could argue the religious view of a soul external to our bodies determining at least part of our mental existence, but there is no evidence to support any such religious view - it is all taken on faith. 
 
 Where abortion rights are concerned, separation of Church and state would not allow for women's rights to be restricted based on a religious argument.","No disagreements.
 
 Something left out (probably because it was assumed), is memory.
 
 What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity. 
 To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity. 
 
 There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required.
 It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person.
 Of course, others will disagree.
 
 Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.
 
 In the case of a chimera, two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes, would have to blend into one person/soul. (No, most chimeras are not schizophrenic).

Every week, they pick out an intersection and hold up gigantic graphic posters, close up bloody pics of aborted babies converted into 6 ft. X 3 ft. posters. Everyone who drives down the street gets these images forced upon them, adults and children, and I just can't agree with this tactic.

Standing on the roadside holding signs and distracting drivers apparently is not. Two days ago I saw the largest intersection protest I have witnessed. There must have been fifty to one hundred protesters holding the giant posters. 
 
 Part of the reason it happens so often where I live is because we have an abortion clinic that serves most of northern Illinois outside of the Chicago area. The mis-named Northern Illinois Women's Center is in fact an abortion mill located in a former school (of all things). So that tends to rile folks up. That the owner of the building decided to name the building ""Fort Turner"" and put a large sign out in front (Turner being the former name of the school) didn't help matters. Bringing in a tanker truck with manure and threatening to hose down the protestors - now that was funny. Once, a Catholic priest rammed his car into the building to gain access then got out of the vehicle and started chopping the place up with an axe, until he was arrested. Needless to say, the abortion ""clinic"" has been a flashpoint in the community since it was opened at least 20 years ago.
 
 Now there are always protestor's walking with signs in front of the abortion mill, and I can certainly understand that. IMHO that is where they SHOULD be protesting.

 PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday.
 
 The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family.
 
 ""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.
 
 Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him ""that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,"" particularly on abortion.

 FOR millions of girls around the world, motherhood comes too early. Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and their children are more likely to die in infancy. One reliable way to solve this problem is through education. The more affordable it is, the longer girls will stay in school and delay pregnancy.
 
 I advise a nonprofit foundation called Innovation for Poverty Action that focuses on keeping girls in school. (We aren't alone; lots of other terrific organizations do this, too.) In a pilot program we ran in Kenya a few years ago, around 5,000 sixth-grade girls in 163 primary schools were given a $6 school uniform free. If they stayed in school, they received a second uniform after 18 months. The dropout rate over the next three years decreased by a third, to 12 percent, and the pregnancy rate fell to 8 percent from 12 percent. Of every 50 girls given free uniforms, then, three stayed in school as a result of the uniforms alone, and two delayed pregnancy.
 
 The benefits of secondary education are even greater. In the same group of Kenyan girls, 50 percent of those who dropped out after primary school had a child within two years, but only 8 percent who went on to secondary school became pregnant in that same period.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every girl and every woman were valued enough to educate, to make sure that girls do not become pregnant before their bodies are ready for the traumatic event of pregnancy and chilldbirth?",2

 The devil is always in the details and the Child Custody Protection Act seems to assume that all parents are good parents when unfortunately there are plently of ****-poor parents out there. It fallaciously assumes homogeneity in the use of parental authority. 
 
 The problem is letting the good parents get on with raising their children while preventing the bad parents from further screwing up their childrens' lives. Protecting both parental authority for those capable of handling it and the children who may be victims of its abuse is not something that the CCPA seems to do well enough.","And there you have hit the nail on the head; there are both good and P-poor parents out there.

"2590","A baby may look helpless. It canÂ’t walk, talk, think symbolically or overhaul the nationÂ’s banking system. Yet as social emulsifiers go, nothing can beat a happily babbling baby. A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd. A toothless smile here, a musical squeal there, and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees.
In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human. Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview, a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals, including a willingness to share, to cooperate with strangers, to relax oneÂ’s guard, uncurl oneÂ’s lip and widen oneÂ’s pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me, myself and mine.
As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book, Â“Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding,Â” which will be published by Harvard University Press in April, human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing.

IÂ’ve had three children, which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants. Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence.

You hit the nail on the head when you said that pro-choicers (for the most part) value the fetus less than the value of the mother's right to her own body.

In their case I would ask them if they value a person who was recently deceased, where the cells of the body are still living, but there is no mental existence. I also beleive you are right in saying most pro-choicers do not place as high a value on a foetus (which is not a person) as they do on the woman (who is a fully developed person).

 WHEN diseases like swine flu hit, pregnant women are especially at risk. And yet we know surprisingly little about how to treat them. In its guidelines for the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that pregnant women infected or at high risk for infection should take the recommended adult dosage: ""Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication"" to taking the drugs, because the benefits of treatment ""likely outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use.""
 
 But we don't know whether this is true. Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them. It is perfectly possible that the standard adult dose of antivirals will not work in the pregnant body.
 
 Pregnancy acts as a wild card when it comes to medication. Changes in blood flow, digestion, kidney function and enzymatic activity alter the ways that drugs act on the body. There is almost no data on how antivirals function during pregnancy, and the same is true for many other drugs on the market.
 
 The consequences are potentially profound. One of the antibiotics used for treating exposure to anthrax is metabolized so quickly by the pregnant body that no dose, no matter how large, is likely to be effective. If the threat of widespread anthrax attacks after 9/11 had been realized, pregnant women and their babies would have faced disastrous consequences. We should not make the same mistake in planning for the possible reemergence of swine flu in the fall.
 
 One pregnant woman in America has already died from the flu. Although other health problems complicated her illness, her death is a reminder that we need to understand how to medicate mothers-to-be. Research should be done now, while pregnant women are already taking antivirals. Studying blood samples from as few as two dozen women would get us a long way toward determining whether the standard dose is effective.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if, in this male-centered world, drugs were designed to be women-friendly, especially pregnant women-friendly?",2

 PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday.
 
 The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family.
 
 ""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.
 
 Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him ""that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,"" particularly on abortion.

 I find it truly insulting that this great nation, which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right. If we put aside the bible, the commandments, and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders, what argument is left? 
 The Christian right will say that all life is precious, but obviously there are tiers. An unborn, unwanted, and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother. Who cares if she was raped? Who cares if she was the victim of incest? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- ""My preacher says it's wrong!""
 Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control, but it failed, so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted, and even worse, as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control, her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy. But if these ""pro-lifers"" have their way, she will be forced to have the child, and raise it.
 Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption. One must wonder, though, if adoptive families were so abundant, why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded, which means of course, that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines, you will not recieve a child. Single parents (no matter the income) homosexuals, any person who does not subscribe to christianity is immediately disqualified!
 What I really want to say is, If you have some moral objection to abortion, that's just fine~ then never have one yourself. But please do not expect another person to conform to your ideas. Why should they?","But didn't you know? The USA is a CHRISTIAN NATION and all other beliefs are subservient to that.

"8607","First of all, I am against abortion in nearly every circumstance, to save the mother's life and rape or incest being the situations I deem it allowable.
 
 That said, the anti-abortion people where I live are beginning to get on my last nerve. Every week, they pick out an intersection and hold up gigantic graphic posters, close up bloody pics of aborted babies converted into 6 ft. X 3 ft. posters. Everyone who drives down the street gets these images forced upon them, adults and children, and I just can't agree with this tactic.
 
 Often when I am stuck at a red light one of the whackos will yell something my way (little does he or she know my stance on the issue) and I will generally yell something back like ""Get a f-kin job ya freek!"" Stuff like that. :) 
 
 They have now taken to knocking on vehicle windows at stop lights, attempting to pass out pamphlets - even though that is illegal by city ordinance. Standing on the roadside holding signs and distracting drivers apparently is not. Two days ago I saw the largest intersection protest I have witnessed. There must have been fifty to one hundred protesters holding the giant posters. 
 
 Part of the reason it happens so often where I live is because we have an abortion clinic that serves most of northern Illinois outside of the Chicago area. The mis-named Northern Illinois Women's Center is in fact an abortion mill located in a former school (of all things). So that tends to rile folks up. That the owner of the building decided to name the building ""Fort Turner"" and put a large sign out in front (Turner being the former name of the school) didn't help matters. Bringing in a tanker truck with manure and threatening to hose down the protestors - now that was funny. Once, a Catholic priest rammed his car into the building to gain access then got out of the vehicle and started chopping the place up with an axe, until he was arrested. Needless to say, the abortion ""clinic"" has been a flashpoint in the community since it was opened at least 20 years ago.
 
 Now there are always protestor's walking with signs in front of the abortion mill, and I can certainly understand that. IMHO that is where they SHOULD be protesting. But, I am becoming more and more perturbed with the people forcing these disgusting giant photo's on the public in general at public street intersections.

 The federal appeals court judge was asked at her confirmation hearing Tuesday to state how she felt about the landmark Roe versus Wade ruling legalizing abortion in 1973.
 
 Sotomayor told the Senate Judiciary Committee that ""there is a right of privacy. The court has found it in various places in the Constitution."" She said this right is stated in the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law. She declined to say pointblank if she agreed with the high court's precedent on this volatile issue.
 
 Answering a question later from Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Sotomayor said that ""all precedents of the Supreme Court I consider settled law,"" subject to the possibility of subsequent reversal, such as when the court last month renounced a previous precedent in a reverse discrimination case. It ruled 5-4 on the side of white firefighters from New Haven, Conn., who challenged a decision by the city to discard the results of an employee test in which they fared better than minorities who took the examination.","While I'm still iffy on her with the whole New Haven case, and her off-the-bench comments on race, this is one thing I commend her for and agree completely with.",2

 1) If a woman gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury--i.e. the baby lives without harm, 
 then a fine results to compensate for the assault.
 
 2) If a woman gives birth prematurely, and the baby dies, then the assailant is to be given the death penalty. This point is HUGE!!! What God is saying here is that the value and worth of an adult man is equal to the value and worth of an unborn fetus who was young enough, or injured enough, to die. God equates the loss of an unborn baby as the loss of a life, for He says, ""you are to take life for life,..."" This point cannot be emphasized too strongly. God considers the unborn baby alive, and the loss of that life is considered murder. This murder is punishable with the death penalty. This verse demonstrates three truths:
 a) The unborn's life is equivalent in value to an adult's life in God's sight
 b) This also outlines God's Law against criminal feticide. 
 c) The killing of the unborn is murder

So often, this debate is phrased in terms of the mother's rights vs those of the fetus, but we often forget (including myself) that other people can also be deeply affected by abortion decisions - including the family which might lose a mother.
 
 I would also generally agree that the doctor can often best say what type of health risk exists. Even there, though, the doctor him/herself would have to have some level of judgement about what level of risk is ""acceptable"" and what isn't. Ultimately, someone has to make that decision. Part of the goal of this thread was to discuss what type of risks are acceptable and what aren't.",2

I didn't leave the condoms laying around, they were put away, he found them digging through stuff he shouldn't have been. Feel free to lie to your kids. I won't. Plus he is smart, he would not have been satisified with a vague answer or lie and would have found the information elsewhere and most likely from a source I would not consider as realiable as me.
 
 We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret.","Well I do agree that some people are going too far in treating sex like a dirty secret, most Catholic schools won't mention sex to their students, though they find out much about it elsewhere. Unfortunately this is an unreliable source, as you said about your son could have found out about the condom from an unreliable source. Instead of being ignorant to the fact that they will learn about it, they should step in and at least educate them a bit about it in a proper way. Most (but not all) of the teen pregancies that I've witnessed have occurred amoung girls who attend a catholic school. Though we cannot blame this all entirely on lack of education. Since their other sources of sex are not so great, there could be a problem with such a high availability of these sources in our culture. There is a difference in treating sexual behaviour as taboo and letting it srawl out of control, teaching teenagers about it in the wrong way. Maybe the best way to deal with it would be with a happy medium. Since we cannot deny its existance, but showing kids porn isn't a way to teach them either.",2

 If it was simply a question of putting one abortion clinic out of operation, then yes, protesting wya from that clinic would be inappropriate. That is nto what we are talkling about here, though. They are protesting abortion as an institution. With that being the case, restricting their protest to that clinic would be inappropriate.
 
 I take it you found the pictures disturbing? That is pretty much the point. People genberally have a lot of trouble getting their heads around things like abortion, war, etc.. I had a dinner party not long ago and invited an army buddy of mine who hapened to be in the area. After dinner, there was a ""loud conversation"" between my army buddy, a staunch conservative, and a guy who was pro bush (which pretty much makes you automatically NOT a staunch conservative). They were arguing about the Iraq war. My army buddy, who just served a hitch in Iraq, pulled out a stack of photos when the guy started parroting the bush administrations line about helping the iraqi people. They were photos of civilians, mostly little kids, who were blown apart by US troops. My friend had taken them in Iraq, then mailed them while he was on leave because the US ARmy does NOT allow you to go home with pictures like that (another of those new secret policies). 
 
 The pro-war guy ran out the back door and puked on my lawn. When he came back in, I jokingly said ""so did he change your mind, Chuck"". to which my buddy replied ""I think he just changed my entire life, political affiliations, and religon in 30 seconds"".

 Exodus 21
 22 ""If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
 
 1) If a woman gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury--i.e. the baby lives without harm, 
 then a fine results to compensate for the assault.
 
 2) If a woman gives birth prematurely, and the baby dies, then the assailant is to be given the death penalty. This point is HUGE!!! What God is saying here is that the value and worth of an adult man is equal to the value and worth of an unborn fetus who was young enough, or injured enough, to die. God equates the loss of an unborn baby as the loss of a life, for He says, ""you are to take life for life,..."" This point cannot be emphasized too strongly. God considers the unborn baby alive, and the loss of that life is considered murder. This murder is punishable with the death penalty. This verse demonstrates three truths:
 a) The unborn's life is equivalent in value to an adult's life in God's sight
 b) This also outlines God's Law against criminal feticide. 
 c) The killing of the unborn is murder

 This is the most obscene,disgusting and down right vilest thing i have ever had the misfortune to come across.Do you watch the news or read the papers,because it was all over the national news and the papers so much in fact that the goverment set up an inquiry,and a commitee to deal with it.
 To say my sons body was salvage is bang out of order and i would thank you to think about the effect that your uncaring words have on people.
 
 How long have been on this board,because it is all over the place that fishx{my wife} is staunchly pro life and it would of been more helpful for your case than asking such a stupid question as to ask if she had had an abortion.
 You live in good old blighty and yet claim no knowledge of what was going on do you not remember alder hey childrens hospital.The system you are discussing is the same system that you live under,it was hope hospital in salford that took my babys body and never returned it.","It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.
 
 Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.

 I really don't think the big pro-life vs pro-choice argument is about where life begins or whether or not life is precious.
