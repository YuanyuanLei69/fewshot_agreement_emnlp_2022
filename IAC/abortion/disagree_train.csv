VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs.

Here again is what the Judges said in their ruling, one being a fellow woman whom you are calling a racist, and it doesn't bode well for your law suit partial criminal: But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.
 The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""",0
"6599","I would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more ""in the moment"" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more ""long-term bigger-picture"" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.","But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.

"6795","Actually, they are not very effective at all. Undoubtedly because a condom retains the bulk of the discharge of semen, the rate is cut down. To become infected with any disease, two things are relevant in terms of the offending, invasive agent. One is the presence of some of those viruses, or germs, itself. The other is the quantity of that agent entering the body. If there are only a few bugs, the average human will kill them off. If there's a very heavy dose, the chance for an infection succeeding is greater. Therefore, by cutting down on the volume of semen, a condom certainly reduces the chance for AIDS. But AIDS viruses do get through the condom.","Why is the rate of AIDS so high in Africa then, where donoms are rare, but so low in the Western world, where condoms are the norm.

 Therefore, the opinion takes great pains to point out, the Court is in no position to choose one from among all the competing theories and stamp it with the government's imprimatur. 
 
 Ultimately, the decision points out, the choice must be left where it properly belongs, in the hands of each individual woman.
 
 The later term abortions that the decision discusses, which form a minuscule percentage of those performed, were not declared to be illegal or unconstitutional in any way whatsoever. The Court simply said that, in order to protect the health of the woman, the state could prescribe the site of the abortion.

"5717","As derived from my exploratory campaign web site...
 
 
 
 d) But the real issue, is the fact that most often, the girl is left to fend for herself, and ends up alone when she commits a mortal sin by killing her un-born child, BUT WHAT DOES THE FATHER HAVE TO DO? MORE OFTEN THAN NOT... nothing... the fathers are just walking away...even though often, they made promises and assurances to the girl before the sex act, and yet, when conception occurs those men are no where to be found.
 
 Therefore I would propose fathering laws, to hold men responsible for abortions, by mandating that women who have abortions, can give the name of the man or boy, and that simple DNA testing can prove they are the father, and those hesitant fathers, should do three months of hard labor, for each abortion they cause, by their lack of commitment and affection. In this way, the girls, and women are not imprisoned, or punished, but men who choose not to use a condom, and made false promises, will pay for their part of the sin.
 
 Of course, the girl, must be willing to give the name, and if she is given anonymity, and protections, she can do so, or not, if she chooses to, or not to. After which, before the abortion, the Father could be contacted by some means and given notice, such that later, after the abortion he cannot claim that he did not know, and as such, is guilty, if he allows the abortion to occur. THIS, will give the man, the chance to marry the girl, or be punished for his lack of affection and concern. But again, all of this is dependant on the girl, willingly giving the mans name, and he must actually be the father to be convicted.
 
 And as such, this law would directly prevent most abortions, by making the fathers responsible for them, as they SHOULD BE! 
 
 
 So, unless they actually want to have kids THIS LAW, will put a condom on all males. 
 
 So, if the goal is to prevent abortions, the best and only real solution is to get the males to wear a condom, and or otherwise be willing support the child, or to MARRY THE GIRL!!!!
 
 This kind of law, would do just that... and does not punish the female.
 
 
 -Mosheh Thezion","But you must realize that it is not always the males fault. For sometimes the girl just decides that the male should not wear a condom, and in some instances she insists that he goes without one. So, when she finally cries wolf, why should he be held responsible? Because she chose not to?
 
 Sure, he should have his wits about him, and think about it, but it's not all of his fault.
 
 I do believe in having to support the girl, but I don't believe in that having that all based upon a promise. Words are words, she should have made sure that he followed them up with something before uncrossing her legs. It's not always his fault, that she couldn't hold them. He just got caught in the cross fire.
 
 While I am pro-life, I don't believe that he should HAVE TO MARRY THE GIRL! I don't think that one mistake should cause them both to be tied down. And then, what if the guy turns out to be a slime-ball? An abuser, rapist, murderer or something? Then you're subjecting both the girl, and the baby to a life of constant danger. I don't think that's fair to anyone. 
 
 All in all, I think that the concept of child support should be kept in tact. That seems to work sometimes.
 
 Either that, or we, the people, should work out some sort of chastity pact. Something that enables the girls to have children, but does not allow it possible while they are young. That or having them keep the big V.

Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue doesn't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus.emoticon_xdonno seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body isn't even in the issue.","I think it could impact the health of the man.

 I don't know how you could say the two aren't comparable. You argument is that the mother shouldn't have to support someone that she doesn't wish to support. You are now trying to qualify it by saying a mothers health is the main concern because health is more important than money. So your standard seems to be ""If the human is being supported by another and may adversly hurt someones health than there should be a choice. Otherwise we can restrict choice. 
 
 Ok, what if child support will cause the man to have to eat worse or work more and thus hurting his health? Does this not qualify now? The man 1) didn't have a choice and 2) has his health adversly affected.

 The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a ""child in utero,"" recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent ""victim,"" with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked.
 
 ""More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books. In practice, these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus.""
 
 See, this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman, it is about turning pregnant women into criminals.
 
 Why do i say that? Lynn M. Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well:
 
 *In 1984, South Carolina's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, causing her, among other things, to lose her pregnancy. In 1997, South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman, Cornelia Whitner, who was charged with failing ""to provide proper medical care for her unborn child."" Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug. Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law, Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse. At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment. The judge responded, ""I think I'll just let her go to jail.""
 
 *Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem. She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term, but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth. The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment, but rather by helping build a criminal case against her. Eventually she was convicted of murder.
 
 The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight's drug use caused the stillbirth. Moreover, no one in this case, not even the prosecution, believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy. Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion, her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed, she is today serving a 12-year sentence.

 another good article on the matter:
 
 Do pregnant woman have rights?
 
 *In 1984, for example, a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section. She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births. The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure. Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help.
 
 *Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion. Doctors ""yelled at and forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated"" the woman in order to carry out the order.
 
 *In Washington, DC, doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section. The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically. The court, apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat, said, ""[a]ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence, separate from its mother, was put simply, a doctor's scalpel."" With that, the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun's flesh, the muscles of her abdominal wall, and her uterus. When the procedure was done, there was no evidence of infection.
 
 *Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She, her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible. The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus. Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder, the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights. As a result, Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity; she lost her life. The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus.
 
 ""All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law.""
 
 That line just about sums it up. These laws aren't about saving the unborn, and neither is the pro-life movement. It is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman. It is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception..as if she no longer exists. These people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage...intentional, accidental, whatever.",0

"2549","My stance on morality is based on the following observations:
 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.
 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.
 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.
 Those are observations, not proclamations.
 The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering.
 
 What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made?
 
 Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid?

 -- inability to take regular medications 
 -- shortness of breath 
 -- higher blood pressure 
 -- hair loss 
 -- tendency to anemia 
 -- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities 
 -- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease (pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women, and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases) 
 -- extreme pain on delivery 
 -- hormonal mood changes, including normal post-partum depression 
 -- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period (exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required, sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover) 
 
 These are the normal, expectable, or frequent PERMANENT side effects of pregnancy: 
 
 -- stretch marks (worse in younger women) 
 -- loose skin 
 -- permanent weight gain or redistribution 
 -- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness 
 -- pelvic floor disorder (occurring in as many as 35% of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50% of elderly former child-bearers, associated with urinary and rectal incontinence, discomfort and reduced quality of life) 
 -- changes to breasts 
 -- varicose veins 
 -- scarring from episiotomy or c-section 
 -- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body (all of these are downplayed by women, because the culture values youth and beauty) 
 -- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids 
 -- loss of dental and bone calcium (cavities and osteoporosis) 
 
 These are the occasional complications and side effects: 
 
 -- hyperemesis gravidarum 
 -- temporary and permanent injury to back 
 -- severe scarring requiring later surgery (especially after additional pregnancies) 
 -- dropped (prolapsed) uterus (especially after additional pregnancies, and other pelvic floor weaknesses -- 11% of women, including cystocele, rectocele, and enterocele)

 -- diastasis recti, also torn abdominal muscles 
 -- mitral valve stenosis (most common cardiac complication) 
 -- serious infection and disease (e.g. increased risk of tuberculosis) 
 -- hormonal imbalance 
 -- ectopic pregnancy (risk of death) 
 -- broken bones (ribcage, ""tail bone"") 
 -- hemorrhage and 
 -- numerous other complications of delivery 
 -- refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease 
 -- aggravation of pre-pregnancy diseases and conditions (e.g. epilepsy is present in .5% of pregnant women, and the pregnancy alters drug metabolism and treatment prospects all the while it increases the number and frequency of seizures) 
 -- severe post-partum depression and psychosis 
 -- research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments, including ""egg harvesting"" from infertile women and donors 
 -- research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy 
 -- research also indicates a correlation between having six or more pregnancies and a risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease 
 
 These are some less common (but serious) complications: 
 
 -- peripartum cardiomyopathy 
 -- cardiopulmonary arrest 
 -- magnesium toxicity 
 -- severe hypoxemia/acidosis 
 -- massive embolism 
 -- increased intracranial pressure, brainstem infarction 
 -- molar pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease (like a pregnancy-induced cancer) 
 -- malignant arrhythmia 
 -- circulatory collapse

 Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.
 
 So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticon_xgood",0

 When I was 16 I was curious about sex because a couple of my friends had done it and I (for some dumb reason) wanted to see what it was like for myself (peer pressure, I guess). 
 
 After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me, had me take a pregnancy test, and as I said was ready to kill me. She was ashamed and really didn't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby. 
 
 I'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets. I would have a child that would be around 11 years old. I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living. I'm married now and have 2 children that I love and adore. They have a good life. I'm glad that I had that choice 11 years ago. 
 A second chance to make it right.","Hi -
 May be good :) for the 2 children, your husband is helping you to raise... But 
 the child, whose life you ended before birth, you gave No-chance to; so 
 what's this rationalization - only in 'your mind' - re ""a 2nd. chance to make it right""??
 
 See you recognized & admit caving-in to ""dumb peer pressure"" before then compounding acts of irresponsibility.
 
 But your mother:
 1. She was ""ashamed"" - was she selfishly more concerned with herself?, and what people would think of her?, and you? and the family? - so, let's just ""Quietly kill it""?
 and
 2. She was ""ready to kill me"" - right: 'Kill ! this! baby!, before I kill you' - type-thing. great; that's a *lesson for Pro-life* not! :xbanghead 
 So your mother failed the *both of you*, bigtime! - and while you can't change that part of your past,
 
 to a degree - much larger than you most likely realize, you are shaping your 2 current children's life. 
 
 And from your rationalizations (about the baby you killed), the concern is that you  model soul/mindfully  for your children, good/honorable behavior. And you support them, in such choices...- so how are you *Interacting with..., Imprinting/Teaching* your 2 children now? - giving them a chance at 
 making better :) choices, you realize...

 In the meantime, you can revel in this:
 
 What does the Bible say about abortion? 
 
 ""And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life."" (Exodus 21:22-23)
 
 Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mother's womb.
 
 Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb:
 
 Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
 before you were born I set you apart;
 I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""
 
 Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being;
 you knit me together in my mother's womb.'
 
 Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? 
 
 That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, it's nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Well, God is not fooled, and neither are we.
 
 Finally, every time you see another child playing and laughing, every time you see a boy or girl graduate, get married, have their own child, and so on, I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body.

Based on the efforts to make it rare so far, I don't think so.","All else you said has been rehashed in other threads and you know my view. I want to comment on this.
 
 No, I said all the reasonable people. I do not believe all pro-choice people are reasonable, or even the majority of them (in America at least). But I do know that the pro-choice position (as I interpret it, at least ;) ) is more reasonable than any pro-life position. Am I an egomaniac or what?
 
 And no, I do not believe ""pro-choice people"" (speaking in terms of politics) would work toward the goal of making it rare. I firmly believe that it will only happen with a massive re-ordering of our society, respecting what women and mothers go through in all aspects of life. I don't think that will happen no matter if abortion is legal or illegal. I firmly believe that abortion is a symptom of ills with society and society's view of women throughout the ages, and the fact that women have not been able to 100% control if they become pregnant. The only reason it is out of the shadows, so to speak, is that we have the technology to have safe and effective abortions. Making abortion illegal will not make it go away and will only add insult to injury by violating women's rights.
 
 As I've said, abortion will not be rarer because of litigation no matter if ""pro-life people"" or ""pro-choice people"" have their way. Women themselves need to be supported and respected in order for that to happen. Making abortion illegal will not curb abortions,it violates rights and shows extreme disrespect to women. Keeping abortion legal may not curb them itself (only the personal views of women will do that), but it shows respect for women and their choices and it does not violate women's rights either.
 
 I believe keeping abortion legal is the first step to reducing their numbers, but it is only a step. I do doubt that Americans have the energy to actually change our society to the point I believe is necessary.

"3990","The one with the COMMON LAW-- but since you don't have common sense, you probably never hoid of it.
 Ignorance of a contract's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them, once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration (i.e. engaging in ""sexual congress"" as you put it); and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman doesn't involve the risk of pregnancy, they're inexcusably ignorant... like you. This creates an implied-in-fact contract between the the man and the woman, with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto (i.e. parental rights over the child etc).
 
 Those are the clear and obvious terms, and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency-agreement between the couple doing the coupling, and any potential offspring resulting therefrom. If they don't like the terms, they can act to reduce the chances, or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn-- but they can't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party, in order for their own personal benefit at that child's expense.
 Freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases, but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others; and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want, it's about what you CONSENT to-- whether by your actions or words-- consistent with those rights of everyone, whether pre- or post-natal; a woman's body is not another country, let alone another universe. The price of freedom isn't eternal vigilance-- it's RESPONSIBILITY to others, for what you choose do with that freedom.","Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning, I need to address yours points.
 
 I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e. not only in late term. I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with ""nobody home"" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself. 
 
 From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question).
 
 However, once there is ""somebody home"" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an ""other"" to whom one has responsibilities.
 
 One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a ""defense rationalization"", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason.
 
 So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt.",0

 If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby.

That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn't a person. Logically, it is a killing. A life was ended.

"2527","Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is ""settled law"" and the subsequent power to make it so?
 
 I didn't think so.","And can you provide a citation from the Constitution that supports the notion that a President can send the military half-way round the world without a declaration of war from Congress?
 
 Come now. To call an issue ""settled law"" is, as someone else pointed out, to emphasize stare decisis, i.e. ""to stand by what has been decided,"" i.e. to recognize the binding nature of precedent. This is why, in those rare cases where long-standing precedents are overturned, it's such a big deal: the court essentially admits that it had been wrong.
 
 As to so-called ""judicial activism"" -- and again as someone else pointed out -- to emphasize stare decisis is preciesly the opposite of ""judicial activism."" With regard to Roe itself, what I find remarkable is that the court exercised so much restraint: the justices explicitly refused to make a declaration about when life begins. They explicitly claimed not to have any qualifications to make such a decision, and they noted that even those who examine the issue thoroughly -- scientists and physicians, theologians and philosophers -- are nowhere near a consensus on the matter. So they decided not step in and settle such metaphysical questions.
 
 Indeed, it is ultimately individuals whom the court allowed to make this decision as they see fit. And so, they based the decision on the right to privacy. Said right is not explicit in the Constitution, but that doesn't matter (see the Ninth Amendment for why). And said right is also not absolute (as the decision again explicitly says): it is limited in this case by the state's compelling interest in protecting prenatal life (a point which is often overlooked by all sides in the abortion debate), and that interest is directly proportional to the viability of the fetus. But what Roe clarified is that any law establishing the protection of prenatal life as an unconditional trump of the mother's right to privacy is unconstitutional.

"3146","Have you ever explored micro-biology. It is the most amazing universe you'd ever want to explore. It makes the macro-biology world look like lego blocks.
 
 If you've ever looked up at the stars and stood in amazement, that's childs play. Just a bunch of macro-scopic hyper-symmetric globules of matter interacting according to almost perfect text-book formulas.
 
 In the micro-biology world, we have almost no understanding of the complexities of interaction.. We have ZERO formulas that can predict appropriate interaction (though we spend hundreds of billions of dollars trying 'guesswork' in medical labs). micro-biology is the computer-programming world of individual atoms. The number of combinations of atomic interaction is mind-numbing - yet micro-biology has obviously harnessed certain useful patterns.
 
 Discovering DNA was like discovering that we can store programming code on electrical tape. That's a great discovery, but that is a far cry from learning to create software artificial intelligence (another area we're probably 100 years away from).
 
 Defining 'life begins at conception' is like saying that an airplane becomes an airplane when then contract is signed for a work-order. It's a meaningless point in time relative to the MILLIONS of complex interactions that are necessary for an airplanes life-cycle.
 
 Conception is the formation of a zygote, two gametes that are wonderfully complex machines that come in contact in a VERY small subset of life forms (most life-forms do not use sex-discrimination as a method of reproduction).
 
 If you looked at primitive single-celled micro-biology, you'd be hard pressed to even begin to quantify it's beauty and complexity. The fact that a subset of micro-biology happens to congregate into multi-cellular organisms for 'communal living' has both advantages and disadvantages (microbes will survive global warming, will we?). With multi-cellular life, there's sex and sexless reproduction... Again, the conception (from a mechanical perspective) is all but meaningless.
 
 So to give significance to conception reveals several things about the promoter:
 1) There is little appreciation, or at least little awareness of the scope of complexities (i.e. how primitive humans and our brains are compared to the mechanics of our micro-biological constituents)
 2) There is little appreciation, or at least little awareness of the insignificance of conception as a process (it merely promotes genetic diversity without the aid of external agents like viruses)
 3) There is likely an overt indoctrination of a spiritual element to conception/birth - cognitive dissidence is common where a decision that you've made earlier in your life (i.e. that the church is a good source of wisdom) preempts future decisions, even in the face of new logical evidence. 
 
 It follows that 'life' as is primitively portrayed in the ""pro-life"", ""pro-abortion"" debate neglects the fact that we are not individuals, but a collective of billions of life-forms. Many of which dedicate their brief life to specific mechanical functions (formation of skin, hair, red-blood-cells, gametes, etc). Cells regularly 'commit suicide' for the good of the collective (they are programmed to do so). Thus the loss of a cell's life is precious, to be honored, and for the purposes of our discussion, to be taken in context.
 
 A zygote is nothing more than a fraction of a second after a mechanical process of two would-be-dead gametes. There is no ""injection-of-a-soul"". In Rush's paradigm, I challenge you to know otherwise. There is no measureable change in energy/mass or even appearance. Nothing more than can be derived by watching individual molecular structures interacting with their otherwise boring chemical surroundings.
 
 A 'soul', as many would promote, must either be intrinsically present before the zygote or be non-existent. There is no measureable guidance (no random operation - pure machine execution of pre-defined code sequences). And, FYI, the DNA is only a SMALL part of the code-sequencing. Each decade we discover new subtle aspects about micro-biology which humbles us in our lack of knowledge. The micro-biology-machine is glorious in it's complexity.
 
 A 'soul' as one can best be known could exist in the ancestry of micro-biology. The fore-bearers, a plausible architect. And in that vein, every cell that undergoes mitosis (or meiosis in the formation of gametes) is a subdivision of the ancestrial architecture. Not the formation of new 'life'. Nothing changes from the moment prio to and there-after - conception.
 
 It is not important for this discussion to elaborate on the origins one way or another. My intent is to express the complete lack of appreciation for what is probably the most important thing humans will ever have the privledge of conceiving. That we truely are insignificant compared to this vast existence.. That we are happily living at the top of the food-chain and chain of understanding (at least so far as we know there are no other being in our area with greater prowess).
 
 That we should be humble and respect 'life' (which hopefully I've conveyed as greater than humanity by many orders of magnitude). That death is an intricate part of life.. That life MUST commit suicide for the benifit of the many in order for the aggregate to survive.. That given the power to decide who/what lives and dies is not unique to us - even the earliest mobile micro-biology wielded this power. That we must strive to only kill in balance and for the greater good.
 
 And from that greater good, abortion becomes a mechanical act with significance. Is the world a better place for the abortion? Will life flourish because we've chosen to exclude one lineage of genetic diversity from prospering?
 
 I suggest that abortion can be part of the greater-good in many circumstances. To the same extent that not every sperm or egg is properly utilized.. The fact that some have unintentially become fertilized is irrelevant - to the same extent that a mechanical process is initiated unintentially (like accidentally hitting the wrong button on the keyboard - you quickly hit the escape function to ""regain control""). If the parents are not ready to organize their lives around producing the best possible children, then they are not fullfilling their duty as macro-scopic being. Or at least not fullfilling their potential and therefore arguably of little use to the collective.
 
 When you become parents, YOUR potential for growth is over.. That is, unless you adhere to the classical barefoot and pregnant mother, lifestyle, and you are the 'provider'. Whatever worth you provide to the world is, in all probability, limited to your contribution as a parent. You are probably not going to become president, etc, and thus have direct political impact on world affairs. But you can choose to raise a child with patience, discipline, intellect, respect and inspiration. And thereby produce a well balanced human that maintains hope for the future of our species. Or you can rush into parenthood, with a disconnected/mal-adjusted family, producing a depressed/ suicidal/introverted offspring. Which, on average, will 'get by' if not 'devolving' due to lack of survival-based-genetic-cleansing that our ancestors underwent.
 
 I have personally gone through more than one abortion. But they were days after the incident - and as I promote above, the 'escape button'. Soulfully irrelevant. Mechanically boring. The philosophical aspects are best left to the poets, who've got nothing better to do with their lives, apparently.

 That's a bit of a sidestep.

Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers.

 This is the formal structure of the ridiculous and false arguments to suggest that abortion is not murder.
 
 ""It cannot be murder, because abortion is legal."" Amazingly, you citizen-slaves fall for this illogical and ridiculous rant.
 
 The argument is illogical because it pre-supposes that abortion not being murder is valid in the premise. It does not matter if you do it, or the law supposes the premise True.
 
 It is also illogical because the definition of murder used has an arbitrary operator (""illegal""), and no legitimate definition can have such an arbitrary operator as a part.
 
 The idea that deliberately killing a womb-trapped child is not murder is insane, lie-based and ridiculous.","The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous.

 You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way.

That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.
 
 Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.
 
 I'm not saying ""miscarriage is not manslaughter,"" but only ""miscarriage is not always manslaughter."" For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the ""you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex"" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.

Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have.

 We are not special as a species, nor unique. Or only true not worthy point is that we are an incredibly egotistical species that, for the most part, likes to take credit for the inventions of a SELECT few of the homo sapiens spectrum (those that argue- but man has invented this and that... most people are profoundly dense and that is why there are ""HOT COFFEE- CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL"" labels on <cDonald's cups).

It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby.

 There is no substantive, unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced, possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion.
 
 I am inclined to believe that such emotionally-disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made.
 
 But, if one could survey a sizable group of women who were in command of their faculties and capable of making good and reasonable choices, what if these women experienced emotional trauma and greatly regretted their decisions.
 
 My first question to them would be, ""Why exactly did you choose abortion?""
 
 I would like to know if they were forced by poverty to make such a choice, thereby not having a free choice.
 
 Or, if they were forced because of the stigma against unwed motherhood and illegitimate birth, particularly if they came from a very religious household, to have an abortion to avoid shame both for themselves and for their families. Again, not a free choice.
 
 Another factor would be if a woman were pursuing a very desired career and having a child or being disabled by pregnancy would injure her professional prospects. The workplace does not look kindly upon the demands of pregnancy, giving birth, being responsible for children. America is not a very family-friendly nation and women who are responsible for the primary care of children are severely penalized for having those responsibilities. Again, these women do not have a free choice in the matter.","Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are, here's some light reading for you simone.

 CHAPTER 9
 
 HEALTH
 
 MORE SPECIFICALLY, MENTAL HEALTH
 
 In discussing abortion, and abortion for the mother's health, it is absolutely crucial to know what ""health"" means, legally and in practice, regarding abortion. ""Health"" was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court said that abortion could be performed: "". . . in the light of all factors - physical, emotion-al, psychological, familial, and the woman's age - relevant to the well being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health."" Roe vs. Wade, January 22, 1973
 
 And in its companion decision, ""Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare. There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically or otherwise, to care for it."" Doe vs. Bolton, January 22, 1973 44
 
 In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas further elaborated what ""health"" meant when, in law, it related to abortion. He detailed if she had to: ""endure the discomforts of pregnancy; to incur the pain, higher mortality rate, and aftereffects of childbirth; to abandon educational plans; to sustain loss of income; to forego the satisfactions of careers; to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare, and in some cases, to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood."" Roe vs. Wade, January 22, 1973
 
 This definition of ""health"" has been adopted internationally. As a result, in any nation, if abortion is al-lowed for the woman's ""health,"" that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions.
 
 The World Health Organization of the United Nations defined it as including social, emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself.
 
 Let's narrow it down to mental health, in the psychological sense, and ask-are there mental health reasons for abortion?
 
 No! The woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post-abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman.
 
 Four classic references here are these: ""Women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance"" after an abortion as others who had no such history."" E. Greenglass, ""Abortion & Psychiatric Disturbance,"" Canadian Psych. Assn. Jour., vol. 21, no. 7, Nov. 1976, pp. 453-459
 
 Dr. Charles Ford and his associates at UCLA reported the same finding. ""The more serious the psychiatric diagnosis, the less beneficial was the abortion."" C. Ford et al., ""Abortion, Is It a Therapeutic Procedure in Psychiatry?"" JAMA, vol. 218, no. 8, Nov. 22, 1971, pp. 1173-1178
 
 ""The more severely ill the psychiatric patient, the worse is her post-abortion psychiatric state."" E. Sandberg, ""Psychology of Abortion"" In Comprehensive Handbook of Psychiatry, 3rd ed. Kaplan & Friedman Publishers, 1980
 
 All of these support the original official statement of the World Health Organization in 1970: ""Serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems. Thus, the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders.""
 
 Then ""mental illness"" as a reason for abortion is just an excuse?
 
 Precisely.
 
 What about psychological problems after abortion?
 
 When your authors wrote Handbook on Abortion in 1971, there were a few murmurings about post-abortion problems, but little was known. We then saw the negatives as mostly physical.
 
 When we wrote Abortion: Questions & Answers in 1985, physical damage, while still a major problem, was given less emphasis, and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated. With the publication of this book, far more is known about what is now called Post Abortion Syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome.
 
 A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome?
 
 Yes. This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans, but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned. The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion. T. Keane, Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15%, Am. Med. News, L. Abraham, Dec. 2, 1988, p. 2
 
 What is Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS)?
 
 Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead. Those around her told her (and she told herself) that it wouldn't bother her. When symptoms occur, she tells herself it can't be the abortion causing them, and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms:
 
 Repression and Denial.
 
 For some this works successfully. For others it shades off to manageable distress, to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide.
 
 There is a delay?
 
 Yes! Her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years -5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual.
 
 But then, for some, the negative feelings bubble up and break through. Often the precipitating event is: she has a baby, or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with. She finds out she is sterile, or other life-changing events.
 
 What are the symptoms of PAS?
 
 Guilt is ever present in many guises, along with regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, insomnia, dreams and nightmares, flash backs, anniversary reactions. There often is hostility, and even hatred, toward men. This can include her husband, and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional. Crying, despair and depression are usual, even at times with suicide attempts.
 
 Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent, sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity. There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness.
 
 Is this due to religious guilt feelings?
 
 Perhaps in some it is a factor, but most women re-ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time.
 
 Perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses?
 
 Again, not most. Most did not know ""it"" was a ""baby"" when they aborted.
 
 But I've heard that the American Psychological Association says that PAS doesn't exist.
 
 This group has been strongly pro-abortion, and this definitely colors its thinking. But during the past decade or more, there have been dozens of national conferences on PAS. There are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it. Further, every one of the almost 4,000 pro-life pregnancy help centers in the U.S. now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating PAS women.
 
 But so many studies deny PAS.
 
 True, and most are invalid for two reasons:
 
 (1) Timing: Most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone. Since the delay before PAS symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more, these studies are invalid.
 
 (2) Superficiality: Her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness. If the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview, she routinely denies problems. These studies are invalid. Only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms, much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget.
 
 You mean most studies miss PAS?
 
 But most polls show few emotional problems - only a sense of relief! Yes, but ""What women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires."" A Canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion. One half of this group was randomly chosen for in-depth psychotherapy."" What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [to the questionnaires], even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable, the only course of action."" It was demonstrated that the conscious, rationalized decision for an abortion can co-exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level. Despite surface appearances, abortion leaves behind deeper feelings ""invariably of intense pain, involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus."" I. Kent et al., ""Emotional Sequelae of Elective Abortion,"" British College of Med. Jour., vol. 20, no. 4, April 1978 I. Kent, ""Abortion Has Profound Impact,"" Family Practice News, June 1980, p. 80
 
 Are there valid studies?
 
 Yes, and two meta-analyses: James Rogers, who carefully examined over 400 published studies, pointed to the almost universal use of ""poor methodology and research design"" and ""grossly substandard power characteristics."" He concluded that ""the question of psychological sequelae of abortion is not closed."" J. Rogers et al., ""Validity of Existing Controlled Studies Examining the Psychological Sequelae of Abortion,"" Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, vol. 39, no. 1, Mar. 1987, pp. 20-29 49
 
 Another concurred that existing research is methodologically flawed and that women who abort show more negative outcomes than those who deliver their babies. E. Posavac et al., ""Some Problems . . . Psychological Effects of Abortion,"" Psychology & Health, 5, 13-23
 
 How about specific studies?
 
 An excellent study thoroughly explaining and documenting PAS by the team that named this entity is:

 Does it ever lead to suicide?
 
 Suicide is rare among pregnant women, but much more common after induced abortion. It is never re-ported under maternal mortality from abortion, of course, even though it is causative.
 
 ""The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth.... the rate for women following a live birth was 5.9 per 100,000; following miscarriage 18.1; following abortion 34.7."" They note that women frequently get short term ""post-natal blues after having a baby, but that this rarely translates into suicide, and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional, the over-all effect having a positive effect on women's health."" M. Gissler, Abortion/Suicide Link,Br. Med. J., Dec. 6, 1996
 
 Then it is rare among pregnant women?
 
 In Abortion: Questions & Answers your authors de-tail 5 studies clearly showing this. One comment may suffice: ""The fetus in utero must be a protective mechanism. Perhaps women are reluctant to take another life with them when they do this.""
 
 How about after abortion?
 
 In the above book your authors also give the findings of Suiciders Anonymous, and that: suicide post-abortion is several times more common than post-delivery. British Medical Jour., 1996
 
 What of Psychosis afterwards?
 
 This has not changed since Dr. M. Sims' original paper. He stated that, compared to post-delivery disturbances, post-abortion psychoses are much more serious, last longer, and are more likely to recur. They are more often the ""hard"" cases. M. Sim, ""Abortion and the Psychiatrist,"" British Med. Jour., vol. 2, 1963, pp. 145-148
 
 How about an example from a non-Christian culture?
 
 In Japan, where abortion has been legal and accepted for over four decades, a common custom is to conduct Mizuyo Kuyo services in honor of the god Jizo. This god has been made the patron saint of infants who died of starvation, abortion, or infanticide. Small baby statues, in his honor, are bought and dressed. Then, in a Buddhist Temple, rites of sorrow and reconciliation are carried out.
 
 Does abortion have any negative effects on her other children?
 
 In some cases a definite ""Survivor Syndrome"" has been demonstrated. Children usually know that mother is pregnant. They also know when she ""gets unpregnant."" This may cause Survivor's Syndrome, similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust. It is an irrational but real guilt at ""why was I saved and why were they killed."" Dr. Ney has written about this. Dr. Edward Sheridan of Georgetown University has observed also a fear and mistrust of the mother. Originally, a small child, sensing a sibling's arrival, doesn't welcome it. ""When the baby suddenly disappears, the frightened child may get a warped sense of his own power to 'will people away.' Or, if he knows that his mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling, he begins to fear her."" A simple explanation of this was published in: L. Bond, ""The Surviving Sibling,"" Nat'l RTL News, Sept. 25, 1986.
 
 It is also closely associated with child abuse: Dr. Phillip Ney, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Christ Church, New Zealand, and of later at
 
 the University of Calgary, Canada, while still at the University of British Columbia, published a widely read study of this. His analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion (and its acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn) lowered a parent's psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born. P. Ney, ""Relationship Between Abortion & Child Abuse,"" Canada Jour. Psychiatry, vol. 24, 1979, pp. 610-620
 
 Is there treatment for PAS?
 
 Yes, but it is not easy. We first must note that only a few doctors are sensitized to the necessary dynamics of treatment. Specifically, most psychiatrists and psychologists aren't much help, nor are psychotropic drugs. This requires a gradual healing process, and during it she must have ongoing close emotional support from one or several people who do not have to be trained professionals.
 
 As of the late 1990s, the place to start is your pro-life pregnancy help center. They can either work with her themselves and/or will know who can.
 
 Basically, there are five steps to the healing process:
 
 (1) Counter the denial. Bring this back into her consciousness and admit she was a party to killing her own baby.
 
 She must grieve over her lost child - tears, mourning as for another loved one.
 (3) Seek Divine forgiveness. This was not expected but seems essential for almost every woman.
 
 (4) Forgive others. Difficult, again, but some of this is needed to complete the healing and get rid of her long repressed anger.
 
 (5) Forgive herself. Not many get this far, but those who do have real inner peace. What is absolutely crucial at every step in the above is compassionate empathy, support and understanding from one or more persons around her. J. Willke, P.A.S. Five Steps on How You Can Help, Life Issues Connector, Mar. 1996Post Abortion Syndrome - Index Page.",0
"1157","What is your point? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery?
 
 Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God. God has revealled part of Himself to us, but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind.

 When you were a child, and had total awe of your parents, and believed what they told you, were you less of a person then?
 
 Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then, was a part of you growining and becoming an adult.
