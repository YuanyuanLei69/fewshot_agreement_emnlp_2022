 of 84 patients to see if they had illegal underage sex. Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline is fighting a similar legal battle.

 I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.
 
 I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.
 
 Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.
 
 I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.
 
 I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health.

 Let me see, N.O.W. that 80% Lesbian Lot (by their own count and definition), continue to whine about women not being given 'equal rights', all the while, 51% of the population (that's women) own the MAJORITY of the wealth, represent the greatest number of teachers, have more rights on college campuses than their male counterparts, have more legal rights than men, are given legal custody of children-even when they are drug addicts/drunks/abusers, and are overwhelmingly the recipients of alimony (regardless of their being no children in the marriage).

 Women start professional careers later than men, yet demand the same amount of pay that their male counterparts, get, having spent years in the corporate trenches to achieve their status and pay grades.

 N.O.W. hasn't bothered a peep about all the Muslim women in the world being beaten, maimed, and murdered, on a daily basis; they're too busy complaining that some unsuspecting woman heard a 'sexist' joke while passing by a male counterpart's office (one guy telling another guy a joke).
 
 Yes indeed, poor 'oppressed' American women.
 
 Whiners the lot of them; never happy and wanting to make everyone around them just as unhappy.
 
 The bottom line is this: there is nothing between a woman's legs, which is worth putting up with that, which is between her nose and her chin.
 
 And you can quote me on that!
 
 Keep up the whining, I'm sure the Muslim woman being beaten to death, clitorectomies being performed with rusted razor blades, and noses being cut off, won't bother you a bit; you've got a man in the office whom you wish to undermine, or a corporation you wish to sue, for some slight against your 'womanhood.'

"8232","Sigma, 
 In our previous dialogues you put forth a litany of negative health consequences of being pregnant. Would you agree that abstinence would be the best protection a woman has against these negative health risks? Would you support abstinence to protect women's health?","To answer your question, yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone's health, not just women's. Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex.
 
 Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex. Even if she does not contract any STD, there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer, HPV(human papolloma virus), and having intercource. Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins, and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners.
 
 Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis. Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse, and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin.
 
 Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent. Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent, as well as less domestic or partner abuse.
 
 However, I don't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem. Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle. Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples. Furthermore, there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works. Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education, including abstinence and contraception, is the most effective, according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the Institute of Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association. All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education.
 
 The Institute of Medicine recommends ""Congress, as well as other federal, state and local policymakers, eliminate the requirements that public funds be used for abstinence-only education and that states and local school districts implement and continue to support age-appropriate comprehensive sex education.""

 (I am including a link to this American site because i think most of you reading this are American) A common misconception about pro-lifers is that they're women-hating. This is a misconception put out by feminist groups that support abortion, the truth is there are many female pro-lifers, my pro-life group at the University of Waterloo actually consists mainly of women, sadly this may be due to the fact that women tend to care about others much more than men, affirming my above statement about caring about the children.","I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating. I, too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum. I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that. 
 
 My issue was with ROCC's attitude in the post I was responding to. To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.
 
 ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the ""pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity"" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.
 
 I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers).",1

 of cocaine without any evidence at all, and he 
 sidestepped the issue. Of course, he admitted he's 
 been a drunk for twenty years and so that coupled 
 with the additional information that we have, you 
 know, would just be devastating to him. 
 
 WARD: Well, Let's talk about the information that 
 you have. 
 
 FLYNT: Well, we've been doing an investigation for 
 a little over eight months to the effect that an 
 abortion took place in 1970 in Houston, Texas. 
 He was working for his father's campaign when he 
 was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen, 
 and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was 
 the campaign manager. He got a girl pregnant during 
 this period of time, and she had an abortion. We've 
 been able to locate the doctor who performed 
 the procedure (unintelligible) hospital in Houston. 
 Not only that but we have the affidavits from four 
 of her friends stating that they knew about the 
 affair, the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion. 
 The only thing we could not have which we needed to 
 break the story was the girl to come out, and she 
 would not come out. Whether she was afraid or 
 whether she was paid off, I don't really want to 
 speculate, because I don't know what the actual 
 reason was. But when I started taking this to the 
 mainstream media, I said you don't have to break 
 the story, just ask the question, you know. You 
 asked the cocaine question, so just ask if he's 
 ever facilitated an abortion or paid for an abortion 
 or if he was the father of a child. Just give him 
 the chance to admit or deny it. No one would touch 
 it. 
 
 WARD: As of now, the woman who you know denies that 
 she had the abortion? 
 
 FLYNT: No, no, no. She doesn't deny that. We know 
 she had the abortion. We know she was Bush's 
 girlfriend at the time. This was in the 1970's, 
 he would have been in his twenties at the time. 
 But she does not want to come out. The last 
 conversation my investigators had with her, she 
 said I don't have anything bad to say about 
 George W. And they said, well, how about 
 when he did not come to visit you in the 
 hospital when you had the abortion, didn't 
 that upset you? So she got very upset and 
 irate because I took that line of questioning, 
 and said, you know, I am not going to talk 
 to you anymore about this issue. 
 
 WARD: But when your investigators talked to this 
 woman, did she ever say to them that you guys are 
 wrong, I never had the abortion. 
 
 FLYNT: No. No. 
 
 WARD: And in these affidavits, I assume you have 
 copies of the affidavits, you have affidavits from 
 four of her friends saying that they know she 
 had the abortion? 
 
 FLYNT: Yes, and we have this guy, Robert Chandler, 
 who I said was George Bush's campaign manager at 
 the time, his girlfriend is one of our key sources 
 on this story who actually accompanied the girl who 
 had the abortion to the hospital. 
 
 WARD: Were abortions legal in Texas at this time? 
 
 FLYNT: No, that was before Roe versus Wade and that 
 makes it a crime. And that's the reason why I felt 
 the story was important, because I felt the media 
 should ask him: Is abortion okay for you and your 
 family but not the rest of America? I felt 
 the issue of it being a crime should be brought 
 up as well.

"7278","NEW YORK (CNN) -- A U.S. judge Thursday became the second in the nation to rule that a federal ban on a particular type of late-term abortion is unconstitutional.
 
 In his ruling on the law dubbed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Judge Richard Conway Casey cited a high court ruling and a lack of exemption to protect the health of a woman.
 
 ""The Supreme Court ... informed us that this gruesome procedure may be outlawed only if there exists in medical consensus that there is no circumstance in which any woman could potentially benefit from it,"" Casey wrote in his ruling.
 
 ""A division of medical opinion exists,"" Casey wrote. ""Such a division means that the constitution requires a health exception.""
 
 The plaintiffs in the suit -- seven physicians who perform abortions and the National Abortion Federation -- were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.
 
 ""We're quite pleased that the court recognized that this ban brought an attack on second-trimester abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy,"" Lorraine Kenny, a spokeswoman for the ACLU, told CNN.
 
 The ban included no health exception and therefore would endanger women's health, Kenny said.
 
 Planned Parenthood also applauded the decision.
 
 ""The abortion ban is a brazen affront to women's health, the right to medical privacy and the U.S. Constitution and was rightfully struck down,"" Planned Parenthood President Gloria Feldt said in a statement released by the group.
 
 ""This ruling is a critical step toward ensuring that women and doctors -- not politicians -- can make private, personal health care decisions,"" Feldt added.
 
 The National Right to Life Committee came out against the judge's decision.
 
 ""Judge Casey said his ruling was dictated by a 5 to 4 Supreme Court ruling in 2000, which held that Roe v. Wade protects partial-birth abortion,"" said Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the NRLC, in a statement.
 
 ""Future appointments to the Supreme Court will determine whether it remains legal to mostly deliver living premature infants and painfully puncture their skulls,"" he said.
 
 Penalties and procedures
 A federal judge in San Francisco previously ruled the act unconstitutional, and a U.S. court in Nebraska is to rule on another case by August 31.
 
 The law would have imposed criminal and civil penalties on ""[a]ny physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion.""
 
 The law affects abortions carried out late in the typical 40-week pregnancy, but before the fetus is considered viable.
 
 Such primarily second-trimester abortions usually involve a procedure known to doctors as ""dilation and extraction,"" but referred to by opponents as ""partial-birth abortion.""
 
 During the procedure, the fetus is partially removed and its skull collapsed.
 
 Most medical organizations opposed the law.
 
 In the San Francisco ruling, Judge Phyllis Hamilton wrote that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology expressed the belief that there are circumstances in which partial-birth abortion ""may be the most appropriate and safest procedure to save the life or health of a woman.""
 
 The federal government contends that it is never necessary, refuting the Supreme Court's rejection of a Nebraska law in a 2000 decision.
 
 Since 1995, state bans against late-term abortions have been enacted in more than half the states. They have been challenged in courts throughout the country.
 
 The ACLU says courts considering these laws -- including the U.S. Supreme Court just three years ago -- have consistently struck down the bans because they do not take into account risks to the woman's health.","Just to add more fuel on the fire :P",1

For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.
 
 The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?
 
 Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?
 
 Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?","I'll take these questions (one at a time) in the other thread.",1
"4101","The discussion really got blown out of proportion somewhere along the line. I just had a problem with justifying abortion with false terms. It seemed more than obvious to me to use the meaning of words that is common in the English langauge.

 I think that most people on both sides of the debate value ""human rights"". In valuing ""human rights"", they have a particular image in mind of what is ""human"" in that case. Do you really think that, by forcing them to acknowledge one of the dictionary definitions of ""human"", you will change their view on who or what deserves ""human rights""? There view is based not on official definitions but on underlying feelings of what, in humans, they value - and mental existence is one criteria that is a requirement for them and for myself.

"5267","That's why today, after what happened to George Tiller, I know that the only thing that will assuage my personal grief over his shocking loss is for leaders across our nation to join me in expressing outrage at this heinous crime, this domestic terrorism. And yes, they need to call it out in exactly those terms. That's what it is.
 
 I want to hear massive outrage on the part of the community. I want it to start with President Obama. His statement today is a good beginning.
 
 But that's not nearly enough. He must immediately outline an action plan to increase federal protection for providers and clinics and call for stringent enforcement of the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances Act. He has an opportunity to make a speech that addresses women's moral right to reproductive self-determination as passionately as his brilliant speech about race did during the primary. He can and should lead the nation to a larger and more productive conversation about the complex choices women make, and why women deserve the respect, equality and justice inherent in the right to choose to have, or not have, a child. He should bring together pro-choice and anti-choice leaders and get them to issue a joint statement decrying Tiller's murder as well as all such violent opposition to one another's efforts. Now that would be real common ground.
 
 .... The silence overall from leaders so far has been deafening, as attorney and longtime Arizona volunteer for reproductive rights causes Leon Silver pointed out. And if our leaders remain silent, I can tell you with perfect assurance what will happen next. There will be more violence.
 
 Dr. Tiller's friends, family, patients, colleagues and the many pro-choice activists who have supported him over the years need the vigil in Wichita and those springing up elsewhere to mourn the 67-year-old doctor's death and celebrate his exceptional life. The larger community of reproductive health professionals and activists, including those who bravely escort women safely into and out of health facilities for abortions, need to cry and hug and lift one another up on the wings of their convictions that they are doing God's work, saving women's lives in the fullest sense of the word. I am with them in spirit.
 
 But when it comes to changing a culture that has marginalized abortion by shaming women and hounding, even murdering, the doctors and clinic staff who provide safe abortions, when it comes to changing a culture bent on shaming women who are, in all good conscience, making the most moral of personal decisions -- candlelight vigils alone will never be enough.","George Tiller needs more than candlelight vigils | Salon Life",1

When a woman who's OD'ed is brought to a hospital, they take steps to save her... they don't just say ""She's a druggie, she's obviously sick of life, we'll respect her right to die"". Even if she recovers, and lucidly announces the same intent, they will take steps to stop her. It is because it is un-natural. It is un-natural to kill another human or to harm another human. People do it, but we don't just accept it... we try and put these people into a place where they're not going to do it again.
 
 Further, if a woman smokes, her 'right to smoke' might impinge upon my right to be in a smoke free environment. Why is it that restaurants (at least in this country) now have to be smoke free? Why is my right greater than hers?
 
 I might point out that the woman in question has every right to go down and file a DNR and a living will, and then the medical responders would be required by law to adhere to it. If she went and OD'ed again, and was going to die, they would have to let her die... in effect she has gone through all neccessary legal steps to end her life. When a woman goes into a clinic to have an abortion, she also complies with the law, but for some reason, there will always be someone who doesn't think she should be allowed the right to do so.
 
 Restaurants are not required to be smoke free. There are some local ordinances that may require it, but it is not a federal law. Workplaces, yes, restaurants, no. Walk into any diner in say, Cheyenne, WY to see it I'm wrong. The reasons a restauranteur might decide to make his establishment non-smoking are numerous. The fact is, in most venues, the smoker is the minority, and so it only makes sense. My own opinion is that, while a smoker can last an hour or so for dinner without dying for a smoke, some vehement non-smokers could not last two minutes if they were within a half mile of a lit cigarette.

It is what it is, regardless of how it is perceived or labeled. If you think it's acceptable as the 'right to choose' -- good for you! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children' -- good for you! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here. I wasn't. Take it for whatever it's worth. If the issue is important to you for any reason, I encourage you to do some research on the subject.)
 The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion.' According to currently accepted medical terms, 'pregnancy' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall. And 'abortion' is the termination of a pregnancy. So, according to the currently accepted medical terminology, the answer is no, of course not!
 
 However, if you define 'abortion' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization, then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes. And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no.
 
 The birth control pill has three primary functions (as do most hormonal bc agents):
 
 1. The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation, but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill. 
 2. A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it, but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it.
 3. The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus, but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall, as evidenced by a 'failure rate' when women are on the pill. (In other words, sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill, indicating that all three functions of the pill failed.)
 
 It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo.' How often this happens is uncertain (some estimates are as high as 50% while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits), but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen.
 
 Your physician may or may not be aware of this. Ask her/him if you are concerned. Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions' because according to accepted medical terminology, pregnancy doesn't begin until implantation. While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong,' some people DO believe it is wrong. If you do believe that abortion (as in terminating the development of an entity after conception) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation.
 
 Hope this is helpful information!
 The Bootfitter","I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself.",1
"4926","I will not put up with people that scroll down to the end read the closing comments by the author and then proceed to argue.","(I'm just curious what you mean by you 'will not put up with [it]'?

Just as a suggestion, you may get further by asking respectfully that people not comment unless they have read the entire article. My two cents.)
 
 In this particular article, Mr. Alcorn does not back up any of his assertions with evidence. Some of what he states in this article is common knowledge that needs no documentation (i.e. a human fetus is human and it is alive). But in this article, he states many generalities, he states many opinions (to which there are alternate views), and he backs nothing up. I'm not saying that the facts he presents cannot be backed up, but until they are backed up with solid documentation, there are a lot of holes in what he is saying.
 
 For example:
 ""2f. There is substantial scientific reason to believe frozen embryos are persons, and should be granted the same rights as older, larger and less vulnerable persons.""
 Substantial scientific reason??? Like what? A 'person' is not a scientific concept. Science does not identify the definitions of what can or cannot be labeled a 'person.' That is a legal and/or philisophical topic.
 
 ""3g. Even before the unborn is obviously human in appearance, she is what she is-a human being.""
 Here again, a human being is not a scientific term. 
 
 ""3e. Every abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves."" 
 This is not necessarily true. Mr. Alcorn also asserts that the birth control pill causes abortions prior to implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining. There is no beating heart or measurable brain activity at this stage of biological development. Both of his assertions, as stated, cannot be correct. If one statement is true, then the other must logically be false.
 
 ""5d. It is a scientific fact that there are thought processes at work in unborn babies. "" 
 Where's the evidence? Define 'thought processes.' It may be a fact... that leaves open the possibility that it may not be true.
 
 ""5h. Arguments against the personhood of the unborn are shrouded in rationalization and denial. "" 
 This is his opinion... to which he is entitled.
 
 ""9a. Once we grant that the unborn are human beings, it should settle the question of their right to live. "" 
 True. But we have not yet granted that unborn are 'human beings.'
 
 ""13b. The poor choice of premarital sex is never compensated for by the far worse choice of killing an innocent human being."" 
 Again. This is merely Mr. Alcorn's opinion -- both that premarital sex is a 'poor choice' and the remainder of the statement.
 
 ""14a. Early feminists were prolife, not prochoice. "" 
 Define 'early.' Are we talking back to the days of Eve? I don't believe Margaret Sanger was prolife.
 
 ""14d. The basic premises of the abortion-rights movement are demeaning to women. "" 
 Unsupported opinion.
 
 ""17a. Every child is wanted by someone-there is no such thing as an unwanted child. "" 
 How many children are on the street in this great country? How many children are waiting to be adopted? It may be true that all children are wanted by someone, but it is also true that there are many, many children without a home and without a family... who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home, not finding anyone who 'wants' them. This is fact. A dear friend of mine is a child protection social worker in a metropolitan area. She deals with this every day.
 
 ""18c. If children are viewed as expendable before birth, they will be viewed as expendable after birth. "" 
 Not sure if I follow this one... if someone wants a child in the womb, they are not viewed as expendable before birth... if someone doesn't want a child in the womb and it is aborted, there won't be anything to be expendable after birth.
 
 ""20b. The dramatic decline in our birth rate will have a disturbing economic effect on America. "" 
 Ummm... this may be true. It may not be true. Fact is... we don't know. We can only make educated guesses.
 
 I could go on... but I think my point has been made. One final one, though... I had to giggle when I read this one:
 ""Abortion has made us a nation of schizophrenics about our children.""
 
 It seems that you are fervent in your beliefs that abortion is 'wrong.' I respect you for knowing what you believe and for standing up for it. Understand, though, that there are individuals who may disagree with you. To imply that they are 'wrong' and you are 'right' or they are ignorant or stupid or anything of the sort is a rather self-centered view of the world. In this mindset, it is possible that you are looking at everything from the 'wrong' perspective. Maybe the other person is actually 'right' and you are the ignorant one. (Note: I'm not suggesting that you are calling anyone stupid or ignorant... nor am I suggesting you are stupid or ignorant. I'm just making a point.)
 
 I challenge you to develop a logical argument -- based on facts with supporting evidence, and not based on opinions or 'moral ideals' -- that is so convincing that even the most 'pro-choice' person in the world could see (if they are being honest with themselves and the world) that abortion is 'wrong.'",1

Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. 
 
 In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class - after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. 
 
 In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. It galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal American churches and synagogues. Citizens enthusiastically entered ""Fitter Family"" and ""Better Baby"" contests.","From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:

 Say you are in a fertility clinic and it's burning down. Over in the corner there is a 2 year old child crying. In the other corner is a petri dish (or test tubes if you like) with 5 blastula embryos in it. You can only save one. Do you save the 2 year old child or do you save the 5 lives in the petri dish?
 
 
 
 And this brings up the point of why is it that there are protesters outside abortion clinics that abort pregnancies but there are never protesters outside of fertility clinics where millions MORE embryos are destroyed than ever will be destroyed in abortion clinics?
 
 What gives with that? The fertility clinics are still ""killing babies"" aren't they?

Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy. Desperate action cannot justify making morally objective issues legal, and i say morally objective since I'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective. Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them, though this does not justify legalizing narcotics. Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to, but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction. Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so.

 Steve Calvin August 30, 2005 In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune
 
 Last week's article on fetal pain in the Journal of the American Medical Association proves the desperation of the defenders of unrestricted abortion. The article reviews medical literature and concludes that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain prior to 30 weeks gestation.
 
 The authors were clearly motivated to write what I view as a medical fantasy to counter proposed federal legislation that would limit abortion in the second trimester. The legislation would require informing women considering abortion that fetuses beyond 20 weeks feel pain and would require anesthesia for the fetus.
 
 Twenty-five years of delivering babies and a specialization in high-risk obstetrics provide me some experience to refute the claim that fetuses feel no pain until 30 weeks. Many of the tiny babies that I deliver, some as small as 1 pound at 23 weeks, have required surgery during their difficult neonatal battle for life. All of them receive anesthesia.
 
 Before the 1970s, many newborns, both term and preterm, were operated on without anesthesia in the mistaken belief that they could not feel pain. They certainly couldn't tell anyone about their discomfort. With more sophisticated monitoring it became clear that blood pressure and pulse rose dramatically during the trauma of surgery. Subsequently, a subspecialty of pediatric anesthesia developed.
 
 Those who deny fetal pain claim that hormonal and withdrawal responses to invasive procedures are mere reflexes and are no evidence of pain. Recently, I performed an amniocentesis on a patient at 21 weeks gestation because of a possible infection. On ultrasound, the fetus pulled away from the needle when it grazed her arm. It is clear to me that this fetus felt discomfort, and that she would feel horrible pain if she were dismembered in the exercise of an unjust constitutional right.
 
 The medical literature duel over abortion has been quite one-sided since most of the medical hierarchy is ardently pro-abortion. There are, however, courageous exceptions.
 
 The most important medical study on abortion this year got absolutely no media coverage. A French study in the April 2005 British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology convincingly showed that a previous abortion increased the risk of subsequent delivery at 22 to 27 weeks by 70 percent. Premature birth has heavy personal and societal costs, yet the alarm over the increasing rate of prematurity ignores the abortion connection.
 
 The fight over requirements for informed consent prior to abortion continues because abortion defenders refuse to accept any restriction on this manufactured constitutional right to exercise prenatal lethal violence. Their blind orthodoxy requires denial of fetal pain and willful ignorance of the significant long-term consequences of abortion.

"9551","Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman
 By GENE JOHNSON&#8232;ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
 
 SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.
 
 Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.
 
 Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.
 
 The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.
 
 Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.
 
 But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.
 The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""
 
 They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in ""touch"" mode rather than ""dart"" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.
 
 The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.
 ""Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,"" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.""
 
 The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it ""off the wall.""
 
 ""I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,"" she wrote.
 
 She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.
 
 Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.
 
 Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.
 
 Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.
 
 ""This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,"" he said.","For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)

 Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. 
 
 They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.",1

 The fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side effects does not, in itself, show that the restrictions are unjustified, since murder is wrong regardless of the consequences of prohibiting it; and the appeal to the right to control one's body, which is generally construed as a property right, is at best a rather feeble arguement for the permissibility of abortion. Mere ownership does not give me the right to kill innocent people whom I find on my property, and indeed I am apt to be held responsible if such people injure themselves while on my property.  It is equally unclear that I have any moral right to expel an innocent person from my property when I know that doing so will result in his death.

There is a distinction between using property to kill someone, and failing to use property to sustain someone. For example:
 
 1) Joe shoots Bob with a shotgun. That is murder.
 
 2) Bob is hungry, and Joe doesn't give him any food, so Bob starves to death. That is not murder - it is death by natural causes.
 
 Why is 2) not murder? Because hunger killed Bob, and nobody owns hunger.

"8028","I'm not sure I see the comparison? Explain.","I think Carlene is referring more to the 'implanting a fertile embryo/zygote into the uterus' IVF version rather than just using donated sperm cells. So essentially the various healthy sperm are selected and incubated with healthy eggs (so you have selected them to avoid a birth defect, or because most of the eggs are unviable and you are using a donor one), a selection of viable embryos are then given the chance to implant themselves in the woman's uterus.
 
 The process involves a lot of zygotes being created, many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted. I can see pro-lifers objecting to the slightly wasteful technique (with some just discarded and not even given the chance to develop) but I think in this situation you can't really complain about the ones which didn't implant - seeing as this happens often enough in normal people, and may have been the reason the couple went after IVF in the first place.

 Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception, birth, or some point in between the two (if not before or after, in some cases). That doesn't mean that their version of 'the line' should automatically be the legal one. At the moment (in the UK, at least), that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable; that is, when it could potentially survive a premature birth.

 There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?
 
 The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth.

 Something left out (probably because it was assumed), is memory.
 
 What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity. 
 To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity. 
 
 There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required.
 It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person.
 Of course, others will disagree.
 
 Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.
 
 In the case of a chimera, two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes, would have to blend into one person/soul. (No, most chimeras are not schizophrenic).
 
 I believe an integral part of [personal identity<mental existence<personhood] is memory. Whether it is short term, or long term, without memory there is no sense of self. (I may be stating the obvious, but you never know.)
 
 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
 
 It is not clear if your list of indicators for mental existence is ""one will suffice"", or ""several are required"".
 I don't think it matters all that much, but I'm not sure, just wondering.","I'm not completely sure what you mean by ""personal identity"", but it sounds similar to what I called ""sense of self"". It is a hard term to define. 
 
 Sense of self is different than a recognition of self. I have heard that babies do not have a recognition of self - in the sense that, though they have personal experiences of pain, sensation, etc, they do not recognize themselves as separate from others - they just don't think about their separateness so there is no recognition of a separate ""I"". Similarly, most animals may have a sense of self - they may have a central mental center which feels the sensations, experiences the emotions, etc. - but many do not necessarily have a recognition of themselves as an ""I"" and others as ""you"". They just don't think about the separateness - they just have experiences that they react to. 
 
 Where mental existence is concerned and criteria I use to define it, many of the criteria I listed (thought, emotion, sense of pain, perception of experiences, sense of self, etc.) are interdependent (ex. emotion can be thought of as a type of thought, it takes a type of thought to recognize pain or sensation, etc.). However, roughly speaking, I would say that ""any of the above"" criteria would be enough to define a minimum mental existence - and thus define a person.
 
 On a last point, why is memory important to you? Various people who have experienced major brain trauma have lost most memory function - so they have no memory of who they are, what they were doing one minute ago, etc. One can imagine that the extreme situation would be someone who has no memory at all - so he has no words to communicate, no memory of a personal history. Indeed, every experience is completely new, including the experience of pain, pleasure, etc. However, this memory-less person can still have experiences (feel pain, pleasure, experience the input of the senses, etc.). He would be completely baffled as to what any experience at all is telling him, but he would still have the experiences. Extremely limited as that person would be, I would still call him a person. I'm not sure if that is the type of memory that you were referring to. If not, then please clarify.",1

 Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion.
 
 Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state.
 
 Medical decisions generally fall to the parents.
 
 I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic.
 
 A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer.
 
 Steve - in no way, shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically, mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy, and certainly not for parenting. I have a neices that old - good gracious - no way!",1

"4290","At what stage does the fetus have the possibility of being self-aware?","'Self-awareness' is not a strictly objective, scientific term. I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task.
 
 In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;) 
 
 It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).

Since I'm mainly concerned with whether abortion is legal or not, I'd appreciate it if religion was kept out of the debate. So the questions are:
 
 a) What creatures have the right to live?
 b) When do these creatures get the right to live?
 c) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b.
 
 
 Please answer all questions rather than just one since all three are essential to the debate.","I believe this to be a cross between a religious issue and a social issue. you cannot discuss the issue without discussing the religious, as well as social sides of it. so I won't try. I'll talk about them all. And then I'll tell you why I support a woman's choice concerning her own body.
 
 One at a time...
 
 
 question a) what creatures have the right to live?
 scientific answer: none. there is no ""right"" to life. Life advances and evolves according to natural selection, and the law that the strong survive and the weak are eaten, or else-wise deleted through some manifestation of their weakness.
 social answer: not applicable. humans are the only ""creatures"" who can belong to society, and therefore, obviously, only humans have the ""right"" to life.
 religious answer: any creature with a soul has the ""right"" to live.
 
 conclusion: the issue as it relates to this question is inherently a religious issue, because scientifically the question is null, and socially it has no meaning.
 
 question b) when do these creatures get the right to live?
 scientific answer: never. same reason as above.
 social answer: any creature who ""becomes"" human acquires the right to live.
 religious answer: any creature who acquires a soul acquires the right to live.
 
 conclusion: this time the issue is not only religious; there is a combination of societal issues and religious issues which contribute to answering this question. no conclusion can really be made, yet, though the social answer leads to the obvious question: can a creature ""become"" human? does a maturing fetus in the womb ""become"" human at some point? or is it human from the moment of inception? i argue for the former, though plenty of people will disagree.
 
 
 question c) why do these creatures have the right to live at the time I give for question c:
 see my answers above. they are detailed.
 
 
 
 there is a very, very, very very VERY major question which you completely glossed over, and which is very very VERY pertinent to the issue. i raised this question to a short extent in the conclusion for question b.
 
 i'll call it ""question d)""
 
 question d: at what point does a creature become human?
 
 obviously, this question is debatable. my personal opinion is that a creature (a fetus) becomes human at such time as it could live with minimal medical assistance outside of the mother's womb. this contributes to my further opinion that the larger issue is predominantly a religious one, because with the answer to this question i remove the only reason which would oppose me to abortion prior to the time of capability of self-sustainment.
 
 on the other hand, there are others who are not religious, who are against abortion. always, these are the people who answer this last question differently than me. always, these are the people who believe that from the time of conception, a fetus is in fact a human being.
 
 i cannot argue with their reasoning; it makes every bit as much sense as mine. from a purely physical standpoint, it makes even more sense. yet i stand by my point of view.
 
 i submit, though, that if you want to exclude religion from the discussion, this is the only truly debatable point about abortion whatsoever.

 How is that based on experience? We have no data that says 'an outside world exists'. The assumption that such a world exists is made before we can use the data. But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself.

 'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.","Lets put it another way then. If the world did not exist or did not run by the theories and laws presented by science, you would think that there would be SOME experience at SOME point in reliably recordeable human history that people had which would have shown this. Experience is the only interaction we have with existence. If some aspect of existence exists (ex. some hypothetical parallel universe) that never manifests itself in human experience then we have no way of knowing its existence. We can guess but our guesses, not being based on experience, are completely arbitrary. Given that there are a nearly infinite number of imaginary scenarios that we can think up, the probability of the reality of any of those scenarious is miniscule.
 
 One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes.

 To be honest, this poll question worked perfectly. It shows people just don't really know the subject very well. You are right in being confused about second trimester abortions...I mean if you are worried about it being a valued creature then what changed?
 
 You could probably ask why and give some possible answers and then after that follow up with exemptions and then follow up with certain examples to see where they would come out on. I think what you would find would be a public that doesn't think anything through and works on a gut feeling of what they would want. For example, if you asked ""would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester even if the woman was struggling in college"" then you'd probably get 60% of people to say they would allow it. If you asked it ""would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester as a form of birth control"" then you'd probably get 60% saying no or more.

 I take it you found the pictures disturbing? That is pretty much the point. People genberally have a lot of trouble getting their heads around things like abortion, war, etc..

After dinner, there was a ""loud conversation"" between my army buddy, a staunch conservative, and a guy who was pro bush (which pretty much makes you automatically NOT a staunch conservative). They were arguing about the Iraq war. My army buddy, who just served a hitch in Iraq, pulled out a stack of photos when the guy started parroting the bush administrations line about helping the iraqi people. They were photos of civilians, mostly little kids, who were blown apart by US troops. My friend had taken them in Iraq, then mailed them while he was on leave because the US ARmy does NOT allow you to go home with pictures like that (another of those new secret policies). 
 
 The pro-war guy ran out the back door and puked on my lawn. When he came back in, I jokingly said ""so did he change your mind, Chuck"". to which my buddy replied ""I think he just changed my entire life, political affiliations, and religon in 30 seconds"".

 Hi, I'm brand new to this forum but not to abortion debates. I have been active in abortion debates for almost 20 years now. (not bragging, just providing some background) I started ""online"" debating even before the internet was available to the general public. We used a direct dial BBS called ""FIDONET."" (look it up on Wikipedia)
 
 I used to be ""pro-choice"" with regard to elective abortion.  and the legality thereof. I was of the (seemingly very common) belief that many people express; ""I wouldn't personally want my child aborted,.. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body?""
 
 Sound familiar?
 
 Long story, short? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge. He (Rush Limbaugh) said that he believed that ""a persons life (rights) begins at and by their conceptionm,,, and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way.""
 
 (I despised Rush Limbaugh)
 
 That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues... and I have been actively involved ever since.
 
 I have already read through several of the threads (including this one) in this forum and I'm looking forward to participating,... and possibly incorporating it into my website. ChuzLife.net (under construction)",1
"4140","After a Devastating Birth Injury, Hope
 By DENISE GRADY
 DODOMA, Tanzania - Lying side by side on a narrow bed, talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets.
 
 But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward, and between the moments of laughter, Sarah Jonas, 18, and Mwanaidi Swalehe, 17, had an inescapable air of sadness. Pregnant at 16, both had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days. Their babies had died, and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers: an internal wound called a fistula, which left them incontinent and soaked in urine....
 
 Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby's skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.
 
 One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.","http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/health/24hospital.html

 Life begins at the point of conception. No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.","You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape?

 What do you mean by ""fully human""? Why do you think the fetus is not fully human? Also, why do you place any value in the life of a fetus?","Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival, after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone, before it is entirely reliant on one person, if that person dies, the feotus dies. I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human, it has the potential to become human. The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life. I value monkeys more than I value cows, for example, I value cows more than I value mice, or rats. I would only kill cows for food, not for sport or because they were irritating. Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I couldn't get rid of them any other way, insects I'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me. The feotus I consider to be close to human, closer than any other species and, whilst I consider it wrong to kill it, I can understand why others don't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life.

"3972","This is not a part of the argument, though. Whether or not the woman can or cannot perform activities she wishes to do (which is not the case in pregnancy, btw, or at least varies greatly according to the individual) is irrelevant; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you. The argument is equally applicable no matter the woman's mobility.","Again, I think this to be relevant for the same reason as I think the consent issue to be relevant. Thomson's argument is an appeal to moral intuition. We are told the violinist must be bed-ridden for nine months in order to support the violinist. This scenario presents one gut reaction. But, if we change the scenario to say that, though the violinst must be connected for nine months, the donor is not bed-ridden, and in fact experiences no ill effects save (to draw as close a comparison to pregnancy as possible) the same ill effects of pregnancy (morning sickness, etc.), then I think another gut reaction arises.
 
 Thomson's appeal, as far as I can tell, is purely to our intuition. The force of her argument relies on the fact that we must place ourselves in the position of the donor, and presumably, when we do we find it unacceptable for the donor not to have the choice to disconnect the violinist. However, using the same line of argument, if we present the argument as I have suggested (that is, relating it as closley to pregnancy as possible), a different outcome likely arises. That is, given that the time of connection is limited to nine months, that either voluntary or passive consent was given, and that the only ill-effects suffered are the same ill-effects experienced during pregnancy, I think the donor is morally obligated to continue the support of the violinist. And, as I suggested above, I think the intuitions of the majority of people support this conclusion, seeing how they seem to believe that abortion should be subjected to more restrictions than is currently the case.",1
