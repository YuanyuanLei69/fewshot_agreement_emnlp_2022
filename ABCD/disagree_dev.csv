I already told that I am no conservative.  Doesn't mean this is not really conservative propaganda. Obamacare is a pile of shit. It's cons outweigh it's pros. Oh so tell me why it is so shitty and tell me how its cons outweigh the pros. He did not end a war, he added one.  Again he ended the war in Iraq just because we are going to war with Syria doesn't mean we did not end the war in Iraq. The debt has increased by more than $6 Trillion dollars since he took office. It is the largest debt increase under any president. Bush increased the debt by 105% he doubled the debt. And also the debt has been dropping since 2012.	"Doesn't mean this is not really conservative propaganda. It's not. You just think that anyone who doesn't compliment the liberals or trash talk the conservatives is spreading conservative propaganda... the video however, is total bullshit. Oh so tell me why it is so shitty and tell me how its cons outweigh the pros. -The majority of companies will have to pay for the expensive healthcare or face a federal fine. -It introduces at least twenty new taxes that total at $500 Billion. -Many doctors will no longer be able to see Medicare patients. -Family policy has risen $2,200 under Obama, when he promised to cut it by $2,500. Healthcare will cost more. -It will lead to a ""doctor-shortage"" do to government control over their decisions. Nearly half of all doctors have said they may quit if Obamacare goes into effect. -It will cost around $2 Trillion, leading to an even larger deficit. Those are just a few of the cons. Again he ended the war in Iraq just because we are going to war with Syria doesn't mean we did not end the war in Iraq. The enemy we were fighting in Iraq, is still our current enemy. It was called ""The War IN Iraq"" for a reason. The enemy is spread throughout the Middle East. Bush increased the debt by 105% he doubled the debt. And also the debt has been dropping since 2012. Debt increased by $4.9 Trillion under Bush. Obama increased the debt by $6 Trillion."	0
It doesn't matter if it's due to religious beliefs, embarrassment or any other reason. It's still a choice the parents make, even if it's a bad one. The difference between my exceptions and yours is that mine address your claim and prove it false- that not all parents are good. Examples of parents using poor judgment doesn't make your case any stronger. If parents make bad decisions why does that mean children should look after them when they're older? I still don't see why children should look after their parents even if they were the greatest parents in the world.	"Okay, for a start- I NEVER SAID ALL PARENTS WERE GOOD I said Children should help their parents in the way of taking them to the doctor.I also said that not every child should look after that parent ""It's not that simple"" I said. NEVER said all parents were good NEVER said ALL children should help out I intend to and I hope my children do to, it's just the decent thing to do."	0

It's not rape yet until the person has begun to rape someone though. The cop can't shoot someone out of suspicion because then he would be in the wrong. So still he would have to wait until the attacked touched the person, but then he still has the option of simply pulling him off.  If I had a gun You are not a cop so that is irrelevant.	The right to not be touched or assaulted against one's will is a fundamental right. If someone comes towards me to rape me, i blow their head off without hesitation.	0
I agree with you on that, but can you be more specific on why they are forced to be homeless?  Some people have taken advantage of welfare. They are being provided for WITHOUT contribution.  How can we expect the homeless to leave themselves in that kind of predicament? You can not apply this to EVERY homeless person.	People are forced to be homeless if they can't find or afford a place to live. But even if they are offered a place by teh authorities some homeless people choose to be homeless because tehy are so used to the total independence of their way of life that tehy don't want to change that.  Many homelss people are mentally ill and/or addicted toalcohol and other drugs. Of course you could argue that they haven't contributed anything so they can't expect any help but I would argue that they are ill in a way and deserve help. Every way of helping poor people, by government or by private charity, creates a perverse incentive because it reduces the pressure to work hard to get out of poverty yourself. But in some cases the perverse incentive is the lesser evil because letting people die or liev in misery would be cruel.	0
"How often? Really?

Your wrong, as I said the dictionary definition defines Cannabilism as eating the flesh of your own kind blood is not flesh, Vampirism is the drinking of blood, when someone has a blood transfusion the blood is injected not drunk and meat rendered into a powder is still meat	If you drink another persons blood, are you not feeding off of that person? Feeding off of your own kind is cannibalism. Vampirism, if taken only as bloodsucking or blood drinking, if directed toward your own kind, is cannibalism. Powdered meat mixed with blood and drank is not eating it, it is drinking it. You are drinking your own kind, not eating, according to you that is not cannibalism.	0

"It is not the Christians that take the Bible literally, but the atheists. Atheists continually site Bible verses as if they are fact, Christians know better. Who is close-minded and one-track-minded as well, not the Christians.  God hasn't spoken directly to man since the time of Jesus, that I'm aware of. How is it that one can say ""God said so""? If you're referring to the Bible, i was written by man, not God. Man has only told man to do things. God didn't write the Bible. Get the facts straight."	"It is not the Christians that take the Bible literally, but the atheists. Where in my statement did I say anything about taking the Bible literally? Most atheists I've spoken to know the Bible contains a huge array of writing styles. Some are meant to be taken literally, some are parables, some are symbolic, some are poetic, etc. You seem to be under the misconception that atheists don't know anything about religion. The reality is that they know more about religion that most religious people do, and that is why they became atheists. The Pew Research Center did a study on how knowledgeable different groups of people are about religion. It turns out that atheists and agnostics are more knowledgeable about religion than any religious group. Here is the study if you're interested. <a href='http://www.pewforum.org/U-S-Religious-Knowledge-Survey-Who-Knows-What-About-Religion.aspx'>http://www.pewforum.org/U-S-Religious-Knowledge-Survey-Who-Knows-What-About-Religion.aspx  I used to be a very devout Christian who spent countless hours studying the Bible and the history of Christianity. That studying is what turned me into an atheist. Atheists continually site Bible verses as if they are fact, Christians know better. Christians are the ones who continually site Bible verses as fact. Atheists know it was written by men and is primarily a work of fiction.  God hasn't spoken directly to man since the time of Jesus, that I'm aware of. Any why is that? Why does he play hide-and-seek now instead of just letting everyone know he exists and what he expects from us? You would think an all-powerful god would have a better method of communicating with us than a pieced-together book written by men that even his most devout followers can't seem to make sense of. How is it that one can say ""God said so""? Christians say it all the time. Just Google ""god said"" and you'll see millions of pages where Christians claim ""god said so."" If you're referring to the Bible, I was written by man, not God. Man has only told man to do things. God didn't write the Bible. Get the facts straight. I'm well aware that is was written by men, but most Christian's I've talked to, including the pastors of every church I've ever been to, claim the words of the Bible were inspired by god. Haven't you ever heard them refer to it as ""the word of god""? Just Google ""the word of god"" and once again you will get millions of pages of Christians claiming the Bible is the word of god. I'm glad you understand that it isn't, but most Christians don't seem to know that."	0

"Haha you love it on Modern Warfare 3 (the game) that's probably why you would think it's the best firearm overall ever made. In my opinion it most certainly isn't the best in modern warfare (in reality). They were surprisingly cheap to buy which is why they were so often the weapon of choice in guerrilla war. So yeah it could have been and I'm sure would have been the favored firearm for those who used it after its design was perfected in the last years of WWII as it has many advantages such as the simple design, its relatively light weight, most importantly for those who use it is that it as you quite rightly said ""really rugged and tough to break or jam"" which is why it's reliable and very well known up to this day. Oh and... It looks nice with that lovely smooth woodgrain (in my opinion) hehe. However I don't think it's the best overall firearm, maybe on your game it is but 'ever made' I can't agree as there have been many firearms since the Kalashnikov."	I never really meant to say it was the greatest firearm EVER. Just that from what i hear its been the most widely used and has a lot of good aspects to it. It beats out the WWII M16 we used for sure.	0

You don't add to a debates point. He's a cunt. is not a valid argument, it's just a statement. Even if that was a statement adding to the point, you did't answer how.

Ah, yes, the view that Ignorance is Bliss. Unfortunately, it's only bliss for those who have it. For the people surrounding them, it is annoying. And what about physical handicaps? Are you saying they wouldn't be any happier without them?  Mentally handicapped provide very little for society and are only a dead weight. If we had the ability to reduce it, it would be our responsibility to do so.	Wow, you are a disgusting human being. Is lack of a soul a disability? Because you've got it. The people who carry a disabled child to term are the kind that will care for it unconditionally. That is why it is a choice. No one is ignorant. And you obviously are too close minded to comprehend others, because that is not what I said. People with physical handicaps can be happy, or sad. Or even simply content with life, just like everyone else. Again, what is your definition of happiness?	0
actually traditional vampires have no relation to bats or wolves.	Yeah maybe you're right, maybe not. Honestly vampires are not my strong suit and I really could care less about them.	0
I agree that the question is silly and no one really knows. (By the way, there are more civil ways of expressing your dissatisfaction with a question.) The thrust of the question is to start questioning why would social conservatives or values voters oppose an issue like universal health care and favor an issue like abortion.	This is because they believe that God gave us free will for a reason. It's one thing to stop murder and rape from occuring, but it's another thing to start forcing others to give money to others. Christians often believe in charity, where the individual gives to those less fortunate, and Christians often believe that those who wish to be saved have to work for it (as in proving their worthiness to God). Not forcing some to be nice to others.	0
You're a theist being led by your god. Although many atheists look up to other atheists and or scientists who changed their minds, they look up to them to the extent that they would admire a celebrity. If having an idol puts you in a religion then the line will never be drawn. As for lack of atheist leaders, it's true. With no formal organization there is no official name to call anyone one who might be leading a group of atheists, that simply pick titles based on the roles they'll play in their group. The religions that are being lead by a leader, have ministers, deacons, and at the very top of the chart, their god. You said atheists want to make the world all atheist and that that acts as their agenda. I disagree with this not only because I don't wish to spread atheism, but also because none of my atheist friends wish to. We don't seek to gain anything by being atheists we just disbelieve god because of a lack of evidence. The ones that do try to persuade others are just trying to share their opinion are usually the debaters, who enjoy conflict. Where as most religions have laws dictating the spread of their religion. You say that if atheism is a religion their religious texts would be science books and seminars. That is only true of the overly scientific atheists. Other atheists choose not to believe god exists because of a lack of proof, but take regular proven science as proven facts, no more no less. It's a stereotype that all atheists are scientific. Atheists are organized, they do have their meetings that center around their topic, but it's no requirement. As for drinking and arguing. it seems like a bad idea to me but i rarely judge. I didn't mind so much, I assumed you were really passionate about the topic.	"There is no requirement stating I need to speak to a leader to understand and know what I know. Perhaps it's considered by some, however, I do not personally feel I need a leader to help me understand, at this point in time. Sure perhaps when I was younger, who is young and doesn't need some sort of leadership? Seriously, I do not understand your argument.  I believe in God(s) at this point because I choose to, just as you choose to not believe. (If this is in fact you stating you do not believe in any god(s)) NOT because a leader or organization told me to.  And so leadership comes in many shapes and sizes. ANd do not clump me into a category stating ""Oh you are this way because a majority of people told you this is how it is. "" I'm fucking old enough to understand and evaluate my own actions, whether stupid or not. I do not believe (not do I feel you're saying I am stupid) that what I believe in is random, or false. I believe in what I believe in because i want to believe in it, after considering MANY MANY MANY other possibilities. Do not discount my beliefs."	0
What about potential for suffering and damage in the future? I know that prosecuting based on future crimes is silly, but at the point someone is already facing life in the system for absolutely horrendous, inhuman crimes, why not? If someone is this dangerous, then they should be in a situation where they don't have the opportunity to hurt anyone. Once they're in that situation, then I don't see the point of killing them except to solve the problems of cost and space, which aren't invalid, but are secondary to the principle of not allowing anyone to choose what deserves death as a punishment and what doesn't.  We could put them in solitary confinement for life, never let anyone close enough to get hurt, but that seems to me to be more a cruel and unusual punishment than death. If a criminal were to be in this situation and decide they would rather be dead, that should be an option.  And I think for the families of the victims, knowing that some kind of substantial justice was dealt does bring peace of mind. At least, it's better than dragging the grieving families back to court every year to listen to the criminal appeal to the judge on why he should be let out early for good behavior. As much as I can't even imagine how difficult it is to lose a loved on like this, I think it's dangerous to base a justice system on retribution instead of prevention. There are lots of terrible things we could do to criminals that would make their victims feel better.	If someone is this dangerous, then they should be in a situation where they don't have the opportunity to hurt anyone. But that's not how it ever ends up happening.  If a criminal were to be in this situation and decide they would rather be dead, that should be an option. In my country we're not allowed to dish out cruel and unusual punishment. Forcibly severing all human contact for life constitutes cruel and unusual.  As much as I can't even imagine how difficult it is to lose a loved on like this, I think it's dangerous to base a justice system on retribution instead of prevention. There are lots of terrible things we could do to criminals that would make their victims feel better. This isn't the basis of our justice system, it's a product of. We would need to determine that the death penalty is in and of itself always unjustified.	0

so you assume that if kids can't get free condoms at school, they won't get condoms at all? i remember never getting a free condom in high school, yet, i never got a girl pregnant in school. hmm, maybe that's cause i did what everyone else was doing and just bought them.	Look, school is for learning... You said that yourself... We also know that school is as much, if not more, about learning how to socially interact with others, as it is about learning about specific subjects. Sex is definitely a social interaction, yes? If so, when kids learn about it in school, they ought to learn how to protect themselves properly.  The concept of free condoms/ cheap, and readily available condoms is to teach the practice to even the kids that can't afford them. I buy my condoms, but if I was 15, and I only had 5 bucks to get me through the week, that money would be going to food, not protection. This obviously leads to a cycle where those that can't afford to have a baby, are more likely to have a baby, thus more likely to need government assistance to raise the baby. So why not just give out the condoms? It's way cheaper than the alternative.	0
Some things are a deception somethings arent. Open your eyes BEFORE deciding your worldview not after: you don't open yours eyes in order to see deception you open your eyes tontrn everything you can and then after much study you decide what you really believe.  Your statement is is nothing but a political spiel; not to persuade people to think openly about things but rather to open their eyes and see what you believe to be true. Why dont you actually present a rational well argued view point rather than spouting rhetoric?	Fact falsifies or verifies belief. I stick with the facts. You claiming to believe in that which has already factually been falsified is ignorance and you post is an example of just that which is ignorance.	0
"Not when I posted that. And not now. And, And AND...you didn't respond to anything I said. Face it, you can't even logically work around the points of a ""drug"" user."

This is because they believe that God gave us free will for a reason. It's one thing to stop murder and rape from occuring, but it's another thing to start forcing others to give money to others. Christians often believe in charity, where the individual gives to those less fortunate, and Christians often believe that those who wish to be saved have to work for it (as in proving their worthiness to God). Not forcing some to be nice to others.	To the idea of free will. That's beyond the scope to the question. The question asks what would God do. Not want men freely choose to do. Second, everyone agrees that murder and tax extorsion are different things. But they aren't unrelated in some respects. We are perfectly happy taxing citizens to fund the war in Iraq (a war that even the staunchest supporters must admit now was an unwise war - and was totally unrelated to the war on terror). Yet no one cries uncle. Make no mistake: these tax dollars in part are meant to kill Iraqis. What I don't understand is why are people content with money that goes towards killing and not with money that goes towards healing. if everyone in the world were given the basic necessities in life such as good health, can you imagine how much more peaceful the world would be? Third, it is hard to believe that 47 million Americans are all lazy and not willing to work. Most of these people are looking for jobs or have jobs and are struggling to pay the rent and dinner. Not everyone has the same opportunities as you and me. It is a matter of chance where we land. For anti-abortion advocates who value life so much, why wouldn't they value lives that already exist? Last, how doesn't the Bible or any religion not force it's followers in some way? The 10 commandments seem pretty clear and forceful. Religion at the very least nudges people towards a direction. It seems hard to argue that any religion wouldn't advocate helping others if it doesn't really do any harm to you.	0
If you believe in heaven, this may not be the correct debate for you. Also, doesn't it get kinda crowded up there? Reincarnation seems probable because it is mind-boggling to think that we are alive for only appr. 70 years in the grand scheme of the universe. The universe may have a lifespan of infinite years. But we only are alive for a tiny time. Do we die for good?  No.	That's a poor argument. 1. The universe is very old. 2. Therefore, humans must be very old. 3. Therefore, reincarnation is probable. Wtf?	0
Do you remember what will you eat tomorrow? No... so then time exists.	I don't follow. I say that the past exists, but the future doesn't, because the future is uncertain. How do we know there will be a tomorrow? The point is that there isn't a tomorrow today, because the universe is reactionary. The entire universe could collapse in on itself in 30 seconds, and tomorrow would never happen, making the future never existent. The future is merely a set of possibilities as opposed to an existent part of the space time continuum.	0

Basically, gravity is a changing influence directed toward anything.	0

"It wouldn't be hypocritical for ""Bible Pushers"" to use science to prove science wrong, because they don't consider science to be a work of fiction. Observed and tested science is what everybody should believe to be true, not one of many theories that haven't been physically observed and tested."	Yes, but if you can't argue with bible pushers using science, and you can't do it using what they do believe in, what can you do it with?	0
Having to grow up with Cassie Anthony as a mother might have been much worse than being killed as a child; so maybe Cassie had a moment of insight and killed her child as an expression of true love, to save her child the life long pain she was facing.  Boom, refuted.	First off to address your other comment, what does a movie have to do with this? Secondly, to say Cassie Anthony had 'true love' for her child that is why she killed her child to stop her child from enduring the pain that she puts on the child does not make sense because if 'true love' existed why did not Cassie just act out of that 'true love' in the first place? why? because it does not exist.  If perhaps she later got 'true love' for her baby then decided to kill her, that is simply to avoid any drama for beating her kids. If she had an insight and 'true love' is real then she would have gave the baby to parents that would have loved her. Cassie killed her baby for herself not out of any insight of 'true love'. <--- that's what i believe though she is let go with a not guilty verdict.	0

homosexuals, at the end are humans. practically a human being has the right to lead his/her life his/her own style , means and needs! at the end of the day, it is his life, he likes another male - it is his choice. so when the society ( in most countries)have accepted homosexuals relations, then, of course they should be given basic rights of a legally married couple.

None of the things you describe fit the WHOLE criterion of life. You are merely breaking down the details of the criterion and then applying something that only fits that single detail. Not the WHOLE criterion. <.<	Not all life forms grow in the sense of term we are using here so that one will have to be ignored, it was an unnecessary and unsufficient criteria to start with. Everything changes so continual change will also be ignored. We are left with reproduction and functional activity, and we have to find something that fits both these criteria. Computer viruses are capable of reproducing, and they are capable of functional activity. Since computer viruses follow both your criteria, following your definition of life, they must be alive. We wouldn't however call computer viruses living, so that means there's something wrong with your criteria.	0
No brainer, it's Picard. While Kirk was an action man, it would have been bad for relationships with aliens species. Not all planets are filled with hot women, and diplomacy is needed.

He would get passed the smell and have it licked in no time ;) Kirk is the winner for having a nose for pussy and tapping it ;)	0

One of the main ways people are encouraged to reduce their CO2 emissions is by constantly reminding them that they are saving money by doing so. This is true. Yet consider what happens when someone 'saves' money. What do they do with this money? They either spend it or put it into a bank (very few people keep their savings at home). Yet by doing either of these things, people in an indirect way contribute again to global warming. Money placed into the banking system benefits the economy, as banks use money to invest. This leads to economic growth, which, at the end of it all, is based upon a carbon based economy which releases CO2. Obviously, purchasing something has a much more direct impact on CO2 emissions - items require CO2 for their production, transport etc.  So it seems that in order to reduce CO2 emissions at all it would be necessary to entirely wean ourselves off oil. No amount of avoidance of CO2 emissions will reduce global warming unless their very source is first eliminated. But the global economy is addicted to oil and fossil fuels. How can we, as a planet, coordinate such a massive project as a conversion to non-fossil fuel CO2 free alternatives? How could countries possibly accept the economic consequences of such an action? We can't and they won't. Any attempts by average people to reduce CO2 emissions are useless, and the problem is nearly impossible to solve on a large scale. What a useless endeavor.	Even if we are now addicted to fossil fuels, we will have to start a conversion to non-fossil fuel sooner or later. As you know, the amount of fossil fuel, which emerged in millions of years, is limited and we already consumed huge amounts of it. There is no reason to wait until fossil fuels become a scarce and expensive resource, before we start that energy conversion project.	0
It's stupid in general to get drunk because all you're doing is drinking to the point where you are hung over and throw up. Why would you want to do that? No one likes throwing up.	Not necessarily. When you drink, you don't get drunk for the sole purpose of getting drunk. You do it to let loose and have a little fun. As long as you know your limit, it's fine.	0

Ok, so God created a jail for Lucifer and the other angels. Then he didn't do anything to make sure that Lucifer didn't take control. So, Lucifer, the first inmate is in control making him the warden. Since God sends everyone he punishes to this place it appears to be His jail. Does Satan get to control who goes into Hell? Which part of the Bible says when Hell was created?	"Mathew 25:41 “Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; The Bible does not say specifically when it was created, but it was for Satan and the fallen angels. No Satan does not control who goes their, do not confuse Greek mythology ""hades"" and the Greek word ""hades"". Also Satan was cast down himself. Hell is referred to many times as ""the pit"" meaning they will be cast into hell by God, Satan has no control over who goes into hell. He can influence people to reject God and in turn will be cast into hell but Satan cannot do it himself."	0

Evidence is a proof .	No it's not. You arrest someone when you have sufficient evidence to do so. But they're not automatically guilty. Even though you already have evidence, you still have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Even proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not absolute proof; you could still be wrong.	0
You know if you looked at the situation while factoring in time, you'd see that the regulations that help big business got there because small businesses grew big and bought out some people in the position to make write those laws. Actually, that is free market, but perfect competition prevents big business. Those regulations designed to impede competition because they were basically written by big business. There is only one that I can think of. That is the antitrust laws exempt for insurance companies. But hey, you're a libertarian, so big business is your friend. It must have been the commies who wrote those laws. That is the most absurd thing that you have wrote yet.  I am for perfect competition.	Actually, that is free market, but perfect competition prevents big business. Apparently not. See: Modern-day USA. There is only one that I can think of. That is the antitrust laws exempt for insurance companies. Never heard of anti-margarine laws? The anti-cannabis legislation? The whole of modern intellectual property laws? I'm sure there are more but these pop into my mind first. That is the most absurd thing that you have wrote yet.  I like to repay absurdity with absurdity. I am for perfect competition. You mean textbook competition. The real world works differently. That's why free market fails because it naturally evolves into something different.	0

That's not how the world works. If I tell you that if you punch me, I'll kill you, and then you punch me, and I kill you, you have not killed yourself: I have killed you. I can definitely agree to that. But don't you think that someone who is well aware of the action/consequence nature of living anywhere with a government somewhat loses out on their ability to complain and appeal when facing the consequences for their actions? The post you're disputing isn't one i agree with, but this is what I took from it.	Being aware of an injustice does not mean you agree to putting the injustice on yourself, from some arbitrary action. If I know that calling the police a wanker will get me arrested, and I do, that does not mean I agree that I should get arrested, or in anyway approve of their actions afterwards. It simply means I'm an idiot.	0

There's a flaw in all of this: Agnostics don't 'believe' in anything. Atheists, however, believe that there is no god, and theists believe there is. So yeah, I do think you can take a position of not taking a position, if that makes any sense. Agnosticism isn't really bullshit, it's just not taking a side on something that nobody has definitive answer to.	"Atheist also means to believe in nothing a-theist mean non theistic. Most people think that Atheism means to believe that there is no God but it actually means non theistic this is because people that self describe as ""Agnostic"" or ""Apatheist"" only do so because the self description of Atheist goes to far as a result the serious discrimination against Atheists!"	0

Your list sounds strangely like it is persecution to tell people they are wrong. Why has Christianity been persecuting people so long? Why is Christianity based on persecution (witnessing)? I am not saying its wrong because the Bible mentions that Christians are going to be persecuted because of Christ.

Its slowly coming to America and it will happen one of theses days and yes Christians do get persecuted in America but its not as big as the other countries.	0
A government isn't necessary to assist in eliminating the need for bartering. It wouldn't have to be chickens for milk and cheese. Instead, a private banking system would fulfill that demand for a means of currency. Of course, that can not be the case at this time because we are too heavily invested in currency with theoretical values, but just because we're invested in a heavily flawed and corrupted system does not mean we HAVE to continue living with it and even finding ways to rectify it. Instead, lets ween off of it and, in my dream land, eliminate any standardized currency. Demand for value applied currency (such as gold or, in this day, bit coins) would naturally be supplied by private groups. Of course, this day would be internet businesses in Silicon Valley.	Isn't bit coin a type of fiat money, or perhaps a type of money restricted by artificially enforced limits on production since introduction of money is based on processing centers doing some transaction work.(mimicking a standard like gold)?  I like bit coin, although I think it may have issues with inflation if it became too popular. Although market transparency has potential to be amazing and greatly reduce market asymmetry well keeping anonymity. which is awesome. I would like to see some things different(to avoid some of the problems we currently have), but digital currency has a lot of potential. I'm interested in digital currency, as well as in digital labor vouchers and similar, how much do you know about them? I like bitcoin a lot better than privatized banks and think something like it may serve as a good transition to a gift economy and stateless society.	0
"I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists have less substantial arguments than atheists and theists of other nationalities; I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists only focus on demonizing one another and completely ignore philosophical aspects of the ""god question;"" I'm disputing your assertion that American atheists and theists contribute nothing new to that debate and subject; I'm disputing your implication that all American atheists compare religion to extremism and all American theists compare atheism to Stalinism; I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists focus on is the actions of their respective opposite groups and ignore the philosophies.  I am disputing these things because although some Americans obviously argue like this, not all do (as you implied). I am also myself asserting the opposite of many of your claims, if in a more general and moderate manner: sometimes non-Americans atheists and theists have very weak arguments regarding their faith or lack thereof; non-American atheists and theists have been known to focus on demonizing one another and ignore philosophical aspects; lots of non-Americans contribute nothing new to the ""god debate;"" many non-Americans make false comparisons of their religious opposites; occasionally non-Americans only focus on actions and not philosophies.  So in short, in addition to your original statements being stereotypical generalizations that are equivalent to racism, the intent of your statement is completely lost and pointless because all of the things you singled out and criticized Americans for doing non-Americans do just as much. It's unfair and hypocritical, and I haven't thus far seen you produce a single shred of evidence or support for your position. So I went ahead and posted a bunch of stuff that refuted your assertions (Americans that do all of the things your criticize Americans for not doing, and don't do the stuff you criticize Americans for doing). That, my friend, is what I was trying to dispute.  but both equally nutty in their actions. Hmm... No. I don't know of any atheists who claim Jesus told them to handle poisonous snakes before dying from a snake bite. I don't know of any atheists who mutilate genitalia because they don't believe in god. I don't know that anyone's skeptical inquiry led them to make themselves a religious martyr and blow themselves up in a crowded area."	"> I don't know of any atheists who claim Jesus told them to handle poisonous snakes before dying from a snake bite. Weren't the ""Heavens Gate"" suicide cult atheists? They drank poison on the belief that a passing UFO was going to beam them up; but that their physical bodies were preventing their teleportation. I don't know that anyone's skeptical inquiry led them to make themselves a religious martyr and blow themselves up in a crowded area. Weren't the Tamil Tigers, responsible for more suicide bombings that Islamic extremists, also atheists? While their goal may have been National Socialism, according to Wikipedia they were also atheists. I'm not trying to case atheism into a negative light; but given that atheism does not possess a doctrinal system, there's no reason to suppose that atheist are immune to the violent excess that we've seen in religion. Atheists simply have less motivation to engage in some acts. Furthermore, atheism is simply the lack of belief in deities. Skeptical inquiry is not at all associated with atheism because to suggest so would be to imply that atheism has some form of dogma. While individual atheists may indeed be critical thinkers. I disagree strongly with implying that you cannot be an atheist unless you are a critical thinker/skeptic. You're not doubt familiar with the concept of ""apathism"". An apathist might indeed be an atheist; but I'd not be inclined to say that they are atheists by way of skeptical inquiry."	0
Actually both will get you ahead in life. Many studies have shown that people are biased towards attractive people. E.g. Halo effect So this helps them socially be it in school or in work. However, with most societies being meritocratic, education is the main provider of social mobility in moving up the classes and in general brains will provide more mobility than beauty(this is not including extreme cases like models or nobel prize winners).	Yeah i agree both can get you ahead in life.But if you have beauty you can seduce the smart guy into liking you LOL.	0

"They've done some very odd analyses, and as it turns out, there should be anywhere from 10 to 1 million ""advanced"" civilizations in the universe at any given time And yet it is all conjecture. There is not even proof that a single 'civilization' exists aside from Humanity (if we can even be called a 'civilization'). And it is very unlikely that aliens have visited, If they exist, then why not? Isn't there quite a bit of evidence to suggest that - if the do exist - they have visited? because although we may seem primitive to them, Why would we seem 'primitive' to them? there is fair reason to fear that if we do not kill ourselves ""If we do not kill ourselves""? I believe it to be a matter of 'when', not 'if'. we may become advanced enough to destroy them If we can destroy ourselves now, then why are we not currently 'advanced' enough to destroy them? so they'd want to get rid of us NOW, while we are not as powerful. Why do humans believe that everything unknown is a threat? Androids, aliens, etc. Since we're not under invasion, aliens don't know we're out there. That's a ludicrous assumption; why is everything 'evil'? Is it because we know that we, ourselves, would treat aliens so horrible that they, too, must take on our 'evil tendencies'?"	And yet it is all conjecture. There is not even proof that a single 'civilization' exists aside from Humanity (if we can even be called a 'civilization'). Agreed If they exist, then why not?

Once again hindsight is 20-20. You cannot be sure that's what the CSA would have turned into.	When you look at the attitudes of the southern people toward slavery you would see that they didn't like it very much at all but since they had no other way of harvesting enough Cotten to make an actual profit they allowed it to continue.

Every advantage comes at a price. The smart tend to be weak, The strong tend to be dumb, the attractive tend to be naive and the ugly tend to be more street-smart but this is not ALWAYS true.	Your statements and conclusion are quite assumptive. Just because particular advantages may be accompanied by other disadvantages (and vice versa), it does not follow that this is necessarily the norm. It is rather idealistic I think to believe that some people are not more advantaged than others. To me, inequality in ability and other attributes is an inherent aspect of any species and humanity is certainly not an exception.	0

Here is a good example of this scenario. A woman is giving birth to a baby. The doctor realizes the woman's blood pressure is spiking. There are two choices 1. The doctor terminates the birth and the woman survies (baby dies) 2. The doctor continues the birth and the baby survives (woman dies) Who do you choose? Is this not killing one to save another? I would save the baby if the baby has other family. The woman if the baby would be orphaned.	I believe the babies life is of much less value than the life of the women. The baby hasn't even reached a state of true conciousness, knowing nothing of the world at all. However the women, who is capable of procreating again, has full cognitive function and has had immense time and money put into her to educate her and keep her alive. I agree that this is a great example of the question in play.	0
Swimming after eating wont give you cramps, if you're a guy. Cramps are a symptom of menstruation, men don't menstruate. Unless you meant that swimming after eating changes men into women. Swimming doesn't do that; unless you swim to Thailand.  I always thought it was funny that Thailand has so many lady boys, because it sounds like tie-land, like a men's clothing item. Not that girls can't wear ties. Like as part of a Catholic school girl uniform. I once knew a girl who wore one of those, it was really sexy. Don't worry she wasn't a student she was a stripper. Well, I guess she was a student, in that, she was only stripping to put herself through nursing school.  I thought it was weird she wore a catholic school uniform instead of a nurses uniform. And not because she was studying to be a nurse, but because she was a Baptist.

"Don't people say ""Happy Holidays"" during this time of the year because Christians are celebrating Christmas, Jews are celebrating Hanukkah, certain African-Americans celebrate Kwanzaa... and so on?

It's much worse than that. Let's say that you (as a man) kill your unborn fetus by punching your wife in the stomach. Now..., you would expect that you would be charged only with assault. But you would be wrong. You would be charged with murder. Now let's say that the reason you punched her in the stomach was because you wanted her to have an abortion and she refused. Well..., you are not allowed to request an abortion. Only she can. Now let's say that you wanted her to have an abortion because you did not want to provide child support. Well..., if she wants to keep the baby, you are required to pay child support. Let me put it this way..., Men and women are equal but women are more equal than men. ;) Here's another way to look at it..., men are forced to take responsibility for their actions. Women..., are not. ;)	But you agree? Both the man and the woman should have the right to kill their kids until they're say 18 years of age?	0

There are people in every religion who feel very strongly that their god is the true one, but they can't all be right, so obviously their feelings have no bearing on what is actually true.  some people count on religion to enlighten themselves As long as they don't try to force their beliefs onto other people, then I have no problem with them. The problem is that many religious people do try to force their beliefs on people without backing up those beliefs with sound logic.	0

If one chooses to kill another person you've shown by your actions that it's defensible to take another's life. Thus taking one's life under that assumption is not immoral it is only applying the chosen morality of the killer. So whilst you consider that killing is always immoral I contend that to one who believes it to be moral - enough to perpetrates a murder - it is also moral to use their morality in judging them.	If one chooses to kill another person you've shown by your actions that it's defensible to take another's life. No, I said that killing is sometimes defensible, not always. There is a big difference. So whilst you consider that killing is always immoral I contend that to one who believes it to be moral - enough to perpetrates a murder - it is also moral to use their morality in judging them. You need to stop using absolutes. I believe killing is bad. However, it is not always the worst choice, and in those instances, I do not feel it is immoral. If someone believes that killing is moral, and they kill someone, it is most probably immoral: only in certain circumstances is it appropriate.	0

Despite what people say in order to be perceived as politically correct, most people do no react well to diversity. People are naturally attracted to the company of those like themselves. If this is untrue then why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? Diversity IS the cause of conflict if the natural human reaction to it is a negative one, and I think it obviously is. Expecting people to embrace those that are different from themselves is expecting them to go against human nature. You say that diversity can exist in the absence of conflict, but can you name a diverse community or nation that does not have conflict between it's differing races or cultures? I would like to see an example of a harmonious, multicultural society.	Despite what people say in order to be perceived as politically correct, most people do no react well to diversity. People are naturally attracted to the company of those like themselves. If this is untrue then why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? I am not trying to contest that people often react poorly to diversity. I am contesting that people simply must react poorly to diversity. I believe that a refusal to accept or understand other demographics is the product of environment rather than genetics; it is learned rather than innate.  And in regard to the comment about people being attracted to those most like themselves, this is true but subjective. We are all humans and our differences are vastly overshadowed by our similarities. Diversity IS the cause of conflict if the natural human reaction to it is a negative one, and I think it obviously is. Expecting people to embrace those that are different from themselves is expecting them to go against human nature. As I stated, I believe an adverse reaction to diversity is learned after birth. However, I recognize that evidence may be contradictory on this issue. So, even if it is instinctual, humans are not slaves to their instincts; if we recognize that a behavior is counterproductive or harmful to others, we have the intelligence and self-control to identify and amend bad behavior, especially if we are taught to do so from a young age. You say that diversity can exist in the absence of conflict, but can you name a diverse community or nation that does not have conflict between it's differing races or cultures? I would like to see an example of a harmonious, multicultural society. I never claimed that intolerance towards diversity is an uncommon thing. Just because it is common does not mean it is inherent.  I posited that diversity will strengthen a community as long as no one in the community is contrary to the goal of coexistence. The larger a community is, the more likely it is that that community includes individuals who are hostile towards other demographics. Thus, a community large enough to be known to both of us is unlikely to meet these requirements. However, I think it is becoming increasingly unlikely that you will be able to locate a completely homogeneous community or nation and the strength, success, and peacableness of all these diverse populations varies immensely. I have been a part of many groups that were both diverse and harmonious. Most notably, I currently live in an apartment complex with a substantial Indian population, and I lived and intended elementary school in a neighborhood split evenly pretty between Islamic and Christian families. Less notably, I often work on group projects in college with people from different demographics. I realize that anecdotal evidence is not a strong support for an argument, but I do think that many of my experiences are reasonably common and I would hazard a guess that you have been a part of a functional group, at least once, composed of diverse demographics.	0
Well this is quite interesting. Due to common knowledge, zoos and circuses are not bad. They actually look after animals and provide food and water for them, whereas in the wild some animals are ceasing to exist and are becoming distinct due to being eaten by hungry animals desperate for food. Circuses and zoos not only provide for the needs of animals but also help keep other animals in the wild safe such as the innocent deers who are forever being targeted by particularly lions. People may think that the place in which they belong is the 'Wild' but also consider the entertainment for human beings. Despite the amount of money zoos and circuses make, people are so entertained and are creating strong relationships and bonding with animals, something of which cannot be obtained if they are not made present to the public. By being made present to the public not only will they entertain humans but will also be respected. Out in the wild, it is likely an animal dies due to starvation/hunger or thirst. Simply due to the lack of water or maybe the inability to search for it. It's quite sad, and also many are prone to diseases and consequently die. Whereas, if in a circus or under the care of the zoo, their needs are being met and they are treated accordingly.	`are becoming (extinct) due to being eaten by hungry animals desperate for food'  Actually, animals in the wild are becoming extinct due to the decreasing area of suitable habitats. Animals have always been eating other animals (food chain). Although it is true that in some areas, y introduction of non-native species to the ecosystem has caused the numbers of native species to fall due to the addition of predators or competition for limited food sources (e.g the dodo became extinct due to overhunting and being preyed on by domesticated animals such as dogs introduced into their habitat by humans)  The entertainment and strong relationships forged with humans are largely for the benefit of humans and at the expense of the animals individual freedom. While you may argue that the individual animal in question is able to live longer in a more comfortable environment, the effect such commercialization has on the species as a whole is definitely an inimical one (see: The Cove) The statement questions the wellbeing of animals in zoos and circuses compared to its counterparts in the wild, not whether the captivity of animals benefits mankind.  Your assumption that animals die in the wild due to starvation/hunger or thirst is somewhat flawed and yet correct. Animals die in the wild all the time. The more capable ones live through more mating seasons and have more offspring, thus ensuring the propagation of only the strongest. Yes, animals do die of thirst and hunger in the wild, but that is the way it has always been ; It is the survival of the fittest. The weaker ones die and have less offspring, the stronger ones survive longer and have more offspring.  However, my arguments are based on the assumption and ideal that, left on their own without any sort of human intervention or introduction of invasive species, animals will thrive and follow the law of natural selection. Sadly, interaction with humans and the interference of humans in the habitats of animals is no longer avoidable. Zoos exist not only for the entertainment of humans but are also for zoologist to study and understand the needs of animals. This study allows us to understand how humans and animals can co-exist peacefully without either of the two groups being threatened (e.g formation of safari parks require knowledge of animal migration patterns/seasons and the study of animals in zoos allow scientists to understand the diseases that plague the species and prevent the extinction of such animals)  The only thing I disagree with entirely is the captivity of animals in circuses. You cannot deny that animals in circuses exist solely for the entertainment of humans and it is an undeniable fact that animals are often exploited and stressed out by the performances they are forced to endure.	0
1) and 5) aren't really to argue and 3) would involve another argument over whether or not the weaknesses of vampires would become a big enough weakness that humans could exploit it so I can't really touch on that either. As for 1) though, before true blood, I was entranced in the Nosferatu style of vampire. With the hideous features and that one long finger nail, then came along the suave, tall dark, and handsome Dracula to bring positivity to the once hideous. Then back to 4) that may be a topic for another argument but I think it mostly comes down to the author in charge. I can say however that Nosferatu, and Dracula would not be in favor of treating humans with rights.	Ah, so refreshing to discuss this with someone who knows their vampires! I think we've taken the conversation/debate about as far is it's going to go though, no?	0

Then they shouldn't sit in front What if they sat at the front? Google: is it safer to sit in front or back seat of a car ? I should make a debate about this instead If these sources are reliable, I don't know -  you mean they may not be true Like what ? Bombs? and that small machine in front of the exercise bike.	What if they sat at the front? Then they are in greater danger of being injured if they are in an accident, than if they sat in the back. Of course, if they sit in the back, they are still in danger, but the danger increases if they sit in the front. I should make a debate about this instead You asked for sources. And isn't this a debate about that ? I mean, the headline is 'Should elementary school students be allowed to ride in the front seat of a car' - I am now showing why I don't think so. you mean they may not be true Yes, I haven't done any research on whether it is true or not. But like I said, the top 10 hits in that google search I made all said the same - the child is safer in the back. Ask all traffic experts, they will all say the same.

Migrants can be old to. They can bring young skills - yes, talents - yes and they'll benefit the country - maybe.  Why do we want migrants to take our jobs anyway. We have plenty of children in school these days that want jobs, they have new talents, they have skills and they are here already. Why not teach these kids to better at there skills so they can have these jobs. Instead of introducing people from other countries, why don't we train our young. Our young Australian talents can benefit ASustralia as well!	"""Migrants can be old too."" Not a large enough number I'm afraid. It is evident that the majority of migrants are in fact quite young, which suits the understanding that they are seeking employment in order to support themselves and/or their families. ""They can bring skills - yes, talents - yes and they'll benefit the country - maybe."" 1. That sentence makes little sense when reviewed. 2. Again, the high majority of migrants are here for the purpose of employment. They bring what skills they have, and are educated in the criteria of skills that they do not meet. ""Why do we want migrants to take our jobs anyway."" For a couple of reasons. Firstly for the fact that may migrants are capable of performing required tasks better than many Australians. If a migrant can perform above the expected level, why shouldn't they have the job? Secondly, because they too are human, they too have families that are in need of support. The more jobs we selfishly keep to ourselves, the more migrants are abandoned to fend for themselves by the very country who took pride in its multicultural freedom. Thirdly, it will provide an increase in workplace productivity, which evidently produces more efficiency/produce, which grants more opportunities for other Australians and migrants to work. Everybody wins. ""We have plenty of children in school these days that want jobs, they have new talents, they have skills and they are here already. Why not teach these kids to better at there skills so they can have these jobs. Instead of introducing people from other countries, why don't we train our young."" I would agree that many young Australians fit the criteria well, but alas, some don't. You argue that not all migrants are perfect, but choose to ignore the fact that young Australians are not perfect.  It is easy enough to wait 16+ years for a child to grow and be educated, but that doesn't fill gaps that are already in need of filling. What you also seem to have forgotten is that migrants bring skills, and that they can be educated within the criteria that they do not meet. ""Our young Australian talents can benefit ASustralia as well!"" Our eligible migrant talents can benefit Australia as well!"	0

He's doing better than I thought he'd be doing by now... I imagined America being a huge socialist nation by now. ;) But in all seriousness, I really really hate the idea of his stance on the War on Terror.

Bush did a lot to help Iraq and help the world as a consequence of this.	Were is your evidence that in 2001 the country was overrun by terrorists and insurgents? <a href='http://www.cfr.org/publication/9513/'>here is the Council on Foreign Relations own description of Iraq's involment in terrorism - the biggest indictment - that he supported groups that were against his regional foes; that's exactly why Iraq was our ally in the 80's (we gave them guns, anthrax, West Nile virus, botulism, etc.)	0

"You're a dumbass OP, for several reasons. You big meanie pants. Jesus cries when you talk like that!  First, asking for help is not prayer. You need help if you think that! If a god existed, perhaps help would be there. Perhaps starving children could get food, instead of lying on the ground, their stomachs burning as they lie there, too weak to move, just strong enough to pray. Then they die. If the above situation had never happened, if poverty and hunger did not kill children, perhaps I wouldn't be so hostile. But it does.  I Shall pray, and see what god has to say about this.... I make sure that those who are in need of help receive help. You may know that I am addressing problems with your soul when the ugliness I show you becomes unbearable....thus saith the Lord Praying is useless and a waste of time. It's pointless feel-good activity with no real results. when you have too many illusions about prayer it's almost a complete waste of time Praying is not having hope. I have hope, and I can wish for things Praying is being verbally clear and persistent about what you hope for. The Lord gets involved to change childish notions into loving action. until I get on my knees and ask a god to do my bidding, I am not praying. Regarding prayer, it is not the posture of the body that concerns god but the condition of the soul. Praying is not asking someone real for help. Prayer can only be heard by someone real I ask Jesus for help, I get nothing. I ask a real person? I get a yes or no. Not some vague ""It's god's will"" bullshit answer. Pray to god and tend to his answers and you will witness healing. Just as faith is not the same as earned trust, prayer is not hope. god can help you improve the way you make use of those concepts...Ask! and tend to the answers! Hallelujah...he is working in your heart!"	hurr rhur hur hurhaior yhio8uahdu hurhuhueeeu derp iuhyugyrr e  hurrrrrrrrrrr xDDDDDDDD looks like you win the argument!! lololkolol your points are SO logical LOL xD ^____^ durrrrr	0
Prayer is a form of meditation at best. Prayer only has an illusion of effectiveness because the brain is simply telling the person it works. The scientific evidence has to be pseudo.

Batman isn't only good at fighting he is also a very good thinker and is capable of beating iron man because of his analytical skills and array of weaponry. Yes, iron man has a suit, but batman has a batbot, a batmobile, a batjet an a batboat. I believe all these would give iron man a hard time. Lets also not forget Batman beat superman and if he beat superman he has the necessary arsenal to rape iron man.	You need to note that Iron man is also a genius, much like Batman. When it comes to smarts, batman doesn't have a advantage. (Although Iron man is quite arrogant) Although I only really know much about marvel, and I don't know much about other comic strips. The only big difference I know of is Marvel characters don't hide their identity and the plot always seems more interesting (to me). SO I don't know all that much about batman or superman. Still, Iron man is my favorite hero from marvel, being that his only super power is his brain. Batman on the other hand at least has some fighting experience/know-how.	0
But... but with freezing you go numb, so it's much less painful!	Actually after a while you begin to feel very hot because your mind is still trying to help you while it begins to circulate more blood in the center of your body and it will even begin to stop circulartion in your arms and legs in order to ensure survival. So eventually you will die the worst death. In the desert you might as well dig a hole in the sand while you can and use the coat as an umbrella and wait it out until night time. You might want to keep walking to because you have 3 days until you may die from dehydration and maybe a month without food.	0

"Gravity hasn't been proven, it just is. We have observed it, but not thoroughly explained it. You don't have to thoroughly explain something like Gravity to prove that i's real, there's obviously some type of pull that's keeping us from drifting off the planet(hey look another part of intelligent design). I have not been to the other planets myself, but I am sure that you've heard of each planet having it's own level of gravity. These things are obvious proof of what we interpret to be gravity, so it has been proven. Emotions themselves could still be fake because people may only give the ""emotional"" response, because they think that's how they are suppose to react."	" You don't have to thoroughly explain something like Gravity to prove that i's real, there's obviously some type of pull that's keeping us from drifting off the planet(hey look another part of intelligent design).  Well, according to modern science an operational definition for gravity must be set and must be tested to its fullest in order to entirely prove ite existence. This means that we eliminate all other possibilities and theories to explain the pull we feel. Once that occurs it has been objectively proven.  However since many theories exist, some bizarre some plausible, many people simply agree with the most logically sound theory. This is our current standars for gravitation. Most theories have been squashed though so only one truly reigns as of now.  Emotions themselves could still be fake because people may only give the ""emotional"" response, because they think that's how they are suppose to act. Isn't that in and of itself an emotional response?"	0
"My entire family is made up of Muslims and I don't think we're any different from any other people. We believe in different things, and we place our hopes in Allah, but how is that any more different than a devout Christian praying to Jesus or loving Mary? Why does this only apply to Muslim women anyway? Why not other ""People of the Book""?"	"If you are Muslim, you should understand it better than others. How Muslims do differ from other people? Beliefs of Muslims are rather different from others because first of all they believe in ALLAH, they worship to ALLAH. Muslims views on all things are different. Since Muslims don't do anything what usual people do. They are more careful with it. I don't understand you, how Christians are related to Muslims. Yes, you are right, they pray to Jesus. It is the main difference that Muslims pray only to ALLAH. Consequently, Muslim women are also different from other religious women. They are rather higher than others.

The point is Nechung is non-Buddhist so should not be consulted by a Buddhist figure. And DL bases his decisions on what the oracle says so yes he does bow down to him and using an oracle to decide matters of state is wrong and this is an oracle which has caused much harm in Tibetan history.	"Nechung is the deputy minister of the CTA. Of course DL is going to consult him.  ""However, although our functions are similar, my relationship with Nechung is that of commander to lieutenant: I never bow down to him. It is for Nechung to bow to the Dalai Lama. Yet we are very close, friends almost. When I was small, it was touching. Nechung liked me a lot and always took great care of me. For example, if he noticed that I had dressed carelessly or improperly, he would come over and rearrange my shirt, adjust my robe and so on."" In Tibetan culture, Nechung is to act as the guardian for the Dalai Lama. Nechung comes to Dalai Lama because that is his duty.  “Tibetans rely on oracles for various reasons. The purpose of the oracles is not just to foretell the future. They are called upon as protectors and sometimes used as healers. However, their primary function is to protect the Buddha Dharma and its practitioners.”"	0

So, we should have just fought Japan and not face Hitler at all... no threat to us what so ever actually...  at least Iraq had an al-Qaeda base in their country...	"Actually, if you recall correctly we entered the war after Japan attacked. We knew better then to get involved with a war that we didn't have anything to do with. Of course then there's the fact that Hitler was committing genocide, but at the time we didn't know the full extent of the atrocities he was committing. FDR was clever though. He was still helping the British without actually going to war, with the ""Lend-Lease"" policy. Iraq had an al-Qaeda base in their country before we attacked? This is news to me but I'll take your word for it. Was this the reason we were given for going to war? Was this why we bombed other areas? Is this why we're still there? Clearly the pretenses for sacrificing soldiers and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were not anything like what you are implying."	0
Editor's Note:(I feel I must argue for this side as I was just boxing up at West Point and now have a big ol' black eye, lol) I don't mean meatheads either, I just mean someone that could protect their girl if they had to. So really, from a biological standpoint, girls would be attracted to the tough guy, as he would be strong and in shape (in hunter/gatherer times, this meant he could catch more food for her), and more specifically they would be able to defend her from other animals (or in modern times, Crackheads) Now ladies, for arguments sake, keep in mind that when I say pretty boys, I don't mean a gym rat that takes time to make his hair nice. I mean, scrawny dudes that have a pretty face... Think Jared Leto, for example, would you be happy with him defending you against a crackhead?... I think not!	Using a Jared Leto reference in your argument makes you sound like a pretty boy.	0
"The source which states that god has those three properties is irrelevant to the analyzes of them.  Given the power to stop evil, is it good to allow evil to occur? For example, it is good for me to watch over a man raping a women when I hold a gun, or should I wait till he is finished to shot him?  It holds no benefit to punish someone after their death, in life it hold a benefit to imprison people because it isolates them from committing similar acts, and grants time for them to change. Punishment after death only holds loses, and no benefit. There is nothing good in it.  Why bother creating those in need of weeding out? Especially if you are ominiscient, and omnipowerful. you would have full knowledge of the evil they will impose on others, it is no different than pulling a trigger of a gun to someone's head and saying, ""hey the bullet had a chance of being a dud""."	"Was it ""good"" for Switzerland to declare themselves ""neutral"" in the early 19th century, progressing through the World Wars? They stood by idly while Nazis tortured and annihilated Jewish people. After the war they assisted the allies persecute German war criminals. Neutrality is neither good nor bad. It is exactly that, neutral. As for you, a non-omnipotent, non-omniscient, non-omnibenevolent, single mortal, standing by as a man commits a terrible crime on another human being is not equal to an entity that knows the products and outcomes of this act and everything thereafter.  Hypothetically speaking, if the bible was true and there was a heaven and a God, the benefit of punishing one with an eternity of hell for what they had committed during their short time in this life is obvious; it shows them, finally, that they were cruel and unnecessarily malicious. It gives them an eternity to consider their crimes and the atrocities they had inflicted on others.  In life it hold a benefit to imprison people because it isolates them from committing similar acts, and grants time for them to change.  In life, yes it does benefit the individual in this manner. However, are you ignoring 25 years - natural life sentences? I don't see how this sentence would allow an offender time to re-integrate into society. Especially since they won't be re-integrating. Why bother creating those in need of ""weeding out""? Why not just create those that will be admirable? If there is a God, I am not him. Thus, I do not know. However, there are many possible reasons, such as: 1. The hope that those ""evil"" individuals will change and regret their actions. God is still capable of ""hope"", no matter how powerful or wise. 2. The implementation of unsavoury events to test individual's reactions. is it impossible for a man to test the loyalty of his beloved woman, knowing that she would prove unfaithful?  3. If God is all powerful, would he not have the ability to surprise himself? Could he not allow humans the ability to ""change"" their destiny?  When the Police know an individual is about to commit a crime, they do not arrest them immediately. They conduct ""sting"" operations and allow the offender to incriminate themselves; just in case the offender does not commit the crime.  The existence of evil is not an adequate argument against the existence of an all knowing, all powerful, infinitely good entity. There is very little evidence for or against the existence of God, and none conclusive. If God were real, he could not be explained by even the most brilliant humans, nor could he be disproven. If God isn't real, what do you really have to lose? You've lived a good life, helped many people and enjoyed your time.  Either way, I don't think God is as menacing and spiteful as the bible says, nor do I believe you must have faith in him to gain access to heaven. If you do good deeds and appreciate your fellow man, I doubt you will have any problems in life or death."	0

I heard in the 90s that there had been millions of sightings of UFOs - all over the world. UFOs do fall under the 'paranormal' category. There are innumerable accounts of pyrokinesis, psychokinesis, hydrokinesis, human enigmas such as X-Ray vision, magnetism, control over electricity, teleportation, ghosts, ball lightning, alien abductions, 'raining animals', etc. Charles Fort cataloged tens of thousands of these. Ripley came across many, as well. So you, as an 'S' in the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, believe that, if science can't prove it, it mustn't exist. An 'N', by contrast, believes in theoretical possibilities. And so, if science can't verify tens of millions of eyewitness accounts, those tens of millions of people must all be lying.	"First, there is a gaping giant chasm between ""it musn't exist"" and ""there's no reason to believe it exists"". I take the latter position, not the former. I have absolutely no problem accepting any of the things you listed as theoretical possibilities. But there is NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE they actually exist so going past ""theoretical posibility"" to ""believing they exist"" isn't a supportable position. UFO sightings is a perfect example actually. Lots of people constantly claiming to have seen one, and yet somehow nobody EVER gets conclusive evidence of a sighting. EVER. Not once does someone get one on video where it doesn't turn out to be either a hoax or someone shooting a high flying plane or some grainy blurry ... uhh... light... or something... WHICH IS TOTALLY A UFO!!!!! WE SWEAR!!!! If these things are zipping around in view of millions of people you'd think just once someone would point a camera at one and get a decent image. Yet somehow that never seems to happen. That should tell you something. And no, the options aren't ""either it's real or people are lying"". People think they see things they didn't really see all the time. This we know FOR A FACT. It's is entirely possible for people to be wrong you know. Lying is not the only option. I have a friend who once swore up and down that she saw Arnold Schwarzenegger at a beach in Canada. She didn't, I know this because I know from news sources he was somewhere else at the time.  She wasn't lying, she just thought she saw something she didn't. It happens. A LOT. And yes, there are innumerable accounts of all those things you listed. So tell me why not ONE SINGLE PERSON can demonstrate one of them under conditions where we can verify they're not faking it? If after all these abilities are apparently so widespread that we hear about them all the time... where exactly are these people when it's time to put up or shut up?"	0

"Irrelevant. I just wanted to tell you, what I do and do not believe. I don't like people coming at me with shit I don't believe.

"Neo-liberalism has crushed the American economy. This is because all of this insane market flamboyance can be traced back to the Regan years when tis particular brand of terror was introduced.  Globalization can subvert nations' ability for self-determination.  Accountability to the stakeholders, who depend upon the service provided by the privatised entity, is lost as a consequence of business secrecy, a practice that is normally adopted by private investors.  The replacement of a government-owned monopoly with private companies, each supposedly trying to provide the consumer with better value service than all of its private competitors, removes the efficiency that can be gained from the economy of scale.  Even if it could be shown that neoliberal capitalism increases productivity, it erodes the conditions in which production occurs long term, i.e., resources/nature, requiring expansion into new areas. It is therefore not sustainable within the world's limited geographical space.  The fact that in neoliberal economies, such as Australia, sovereign communities, including federal, state and local governments, are legislatively prevented from owning entities which produce wealth or provide services, even when public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour, shows that the term 'free market', often used to describe the neoliberal economy, is misleading.  Exploitation: critics consider neo-liberal economics to promote exploitation.  Negative economic consequences: Critics argue that neo-liberal policies produce inequality.  Increase in corporate power: some organizations believe neoliberalism, unlike liberalism, changes economic and government policies to increase the power of corporations, and a shift to benefit the upper classes.  There are terrains of struggles for neoliberalism locally and socially. Urban citizens are increasingly deprived of the power to shape the basic conditions of daily life.  Trade-led, unregulated economic activity and lax state regulation of pollution lead to environmental impacts or degradation.  Deregulation of the labor market produces flexibilization and casualization of labor, greater informal employment, and a considerable increase in industrial accidents and occupational diseases.

"""You can't help being black."" Of course I can't. But, the fact you worded it like that made it sound like being black is a bad thing. ""White guilt IS over, at least for me."" Good for you! Just because you believe its nonexistent doesn't mean it isn't tangible. ""If you try hard, you can be anything you want to. Life isn't easy for anything, so you gotta work hard."" You say life isn't easy for anything but such quote has been detested by numerous of people. Life isn't easy but some people have it more worse than others and even in vice versa. ""If you wanna be president, you gotta work hard."" Well of course. But, its much harder when you are president. But how is this at all relevant to the topic? ""You wanna be a scientist, you gotta be smart."" Common Sense... ""There are gifted black scientists and black presidents. "" Yes, there is a minuscule percentage of African Americans who managed to overlie many hardships and achieve a great life. I didn't face as many hardships because I live in this generation where things are not black and white as much as they use to be because things are getting better but as things get better so does the worse. But what the hell? Black president(s), no, there is only one registered African American president in the American History, his name is Barack Obama. The fact you only say ""scientist"" than the over 100 occupations we have in this country makes me shudder. I mean, not every single black woman and man are going to be scientist. Please give examples too... ""No one is keeping them down, except for certain insane people."" Well that made no sense. Just because your racist doesn't make you insane and its only racist people that are 'keeping them down.' Tommy Hilfger stated that he wouldn't let any black people wear his clothes and he is perfectly sane. So yes, people are keeping blacks down. Black models were turned down by Tommy Hilfger because of their race.  ""I'm not guilty of anything."" I never said you were guilty of anything. I said a quantity of your race is and by the looks of your argument, you did not even refuted a single point I had. You had really no evidence whatsoever and some points were irrelevant."	"Well, I say scientist because to me, science is my favorite thing in the world, and one of my favorite scientists is black. I only see race as a biological thing, but otherwise, I really try to ignore it as much as I can. By ignoring it on a personal level, I hope to invite black, white, asian, indian, arabic and people of any race to be my friend. As far as social justice goes, we are on the white track, and no longer need ""guilt"" to fuel what white people do."	0
"I have never even spoken to you before but for some reason I am still plagued by the unjust discrimination against who I am because of what others have done.  ""Anytime you want to answer a silly question like this, that's Mic"" I assume you are referring to participation in the debate? Well I have never participated in an opening 'argument' to state that I am male or female because I see no reason to. So why would you ever accuse me of that? ""Anything but absolutely serious...is Mic"" Yes, because I am a massive troll. I am a serious debater and as you can see if you scroll back through my argument feed there are points like <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Does_a_perfect_God_exist#arg275409'>this, and several <a href='http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/31200000/Bitch-please-loki-thor-2011-31210513-1920-1330.jpg'>others, yet clearly because I have not said anything to you (due to the fact that recently I have been offline), I suddenly abuse everyone and 'goof off'?

I know that with my dignity intact I couldn't accept a relationship where I made a priority of someone who considered me only an option. Or to put it a bit more crudely, I don't wanna be someone's bitch, plus I don't look to surround myself with people who don't share that sentiment with me.	The association between being a priority to someone and being in a monogamous relationship with that someone, and the association between being only an option to someone and being in a non-monogamous relationship doesn't necessarily hold.  Even if they held, how would dignity not be held intact by accepting a non-monogamous relationship(s) style for your own?	0
"What do you mean by a ""fundamental moral standard""?  Why can such a standard not be individualized?"	There are moral beliefs that are accepted (almost) universally, even if they are not implemented according to the parameters of such a doctrine.  Ethics refers to the interpretation of morals to specific events and settings. That is what individuals could tailor to themselves, but the title of this debate suggests morality, not ethics.	0
Ok then bubbles happen no matter what. No, they happen when loopholes exist, and especially during lax regulations. Also the government increased tariffs after the crash, which is pretty anti freetrade and the economy went up in flames.  Increased tariffs stimulates local businesses by making their goods relatively cheaper compared to foreign goods.  How many monopolies were actually bad for people? Pretty much all of them, in one way or another. Microsoft's near-monopoly on operating system deployment has made the personal computer experience stagnant. The oil oligarchy has made our attempts to transition to cleaner fuels very slow. The entertainment industry's monopoly control over our media has created a lucrative business selling bland television shows, music and movies.	they happen when loopholes exist Who creates the loopholes? But when so many nations increase tariffs international trade stalls horribly. Which is what happened. What more do you want computers to do? Oil is the cheapest form of energy we have which is why we aren't switching immediately. Bland is very subjective.	0

not exactly, it's sort of like the idea of the hamster on the wheel. the wheel only moves with the hamster on it, and as the wheel turns, the hamster keeps on going. and that can produce electricity as well... you just need to find a way to make the gears work that way.	"The ""hamster"" doesn't just move on it's own, it gets the energy to move its legs and the wheel from the food it eats. The wheel doesn't power the hamster, the food the hamster ate indirectly powers the moving of the wheel. If this did happen, hamsters would never get off the wheels, and they would run forever. 100% of the energy the hamster consumed is not able to be put into the spinning of the wheel, and a mechanical system like this could never sustain itself, let alone produce excess energy."	0
I love playing football and I also love playing basketball along with many other sports. However, basketball is not as fun to watch as football is. I don't really know why, I just think Americans these days prefer violence.	Ya, I'm not sure why most people prefer football either. If it was between football and baseball... which would probably win? (baseball?). My issue is they're both slow sports. Baseball is awfully slow... I end up finding so much free time to direct my attention elsewhere until I end up losing interest in the game... at least until the last few innings, then it's funner to watch. But with football, they always gotta make the strategy, line up, hut, run, catch, run, restart. The best part is right after the um, throw and the running begins, but it's like the shortest lasting part of the whole game. But it might be the whole strategy and body mashing that the guys like it for.	0

Bat man is much 'better' at fighting, but Ironman has much, much, much more advanced technology. It would be hard for Batman to deal much damage to Iron man, let alone compete with him.	Batman isn't only good at fighting he is also a very good thinker and is capable of beating iron man because of his analytical skills and array of weaponry. Yes, iron man has a suit, but batman has a batbot, a batmobile, a batjet an a batboat. I believe all these would give iron man a hard time. Lets also not forget Batman beat superman and if he beat superman he has the necessary arsenal to rape iron man.	0
Maybe I'm not understanding your point, but isn't that what the current system is?	The current system records student failures and factors them in to their total grades,so students who did poorly at first but improved don't get rewarded for their improvement, even if they worked really hard to improve. Everyone tries so hard to make school a place that 'mimics the real world,' but that just adds on unnecessary stress to people who are still developing and makes teaching and learning that much more inefficient.	0

Yeah, but you can't attack the flaws of religion in general, you have to address the individual. I'd like to hear your logic on this.	It's actually pretty simple. You can attack flaws and specifics within the texts and practices of a religion, but ultimately an individuals faith is his or her own. If you attack a specific passage that that individual happens to see as a metaphor, you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. If you do the same to a religious individual who concedes that there may be inaccuracies in the text due to oral tradition, translation and re-translation, again you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. Attacking the general flaws of religious texts is pretty much pointless because of that- it MIGHT be useful in the odd case of the individual believer who considers the entirety of the writings to be both literal and infallible, but those individuals tend to be particularly inflexible in their beliefs and fairly close minded to facts even if placed right in front of them.	0

But you're still missing the point. The point is that women as a class are degraded by media stereotyping. We could get into a long involved discussion of the ways in which media stereotyping creates a culture of abuse to which specific women are susceptible in various ways, but the crux is that media stereotyping of women is harmful to women as a group.	But I wasn't answering this point. I was answering your Al Bundy question which was an inappropriate analogy for media portrayals of women.  At any rate, let's get into that long involved discussion of the ways in which media stereotyping creates a culture of abuse to which specific women are susceptible in various ways. And the further argument that media stereotyping is harmful to women as a group. But let's also acknowlede that media stereotyping is not a one-way street.	0

..because more people are doing your job. No, because the government forces you to pay more for benefits. It should be linear. If I have one employee and he can make 2 products a day. Having 2 employees would mean 4 a day. If the business owner has to pay for a bunch of benefits if he hires a third person, what is the point, he can only get 6 products out of it. More employees = more individual workload? I'm willing to completely disagree with you on that one. The more people you have working for you, the more you can get done with less individual workload, i.e. the whole premise of employment.  If he hires the third person and benefits have to be paid to everyone, he would need 3 products from each person. Now, the workers have to work harder in order to sustain their new benefits. Hire less if your business can't afford it? Well then maybe the problem is the shitty business. The business is perfectly fine, but now more money goes from the owner to the workers, why would someone want to be an owner at that point? Profit Which you will gladly take from the owner and give to the workers.	No, because the government forces you to pay more for benefits. Now if we are talking small businesses of fifty or less, there are no benefits to be paid, beyond unemployment, FICA, FUTA, medicade, the works.. If I have one employee and he can make 2 products a day. Having 2 employees would mean 4 a day. If the business owner has to pay for a bunch of benefits if he hires a third person, what is the point, he can only get 6 products out of it. The average additional cost for an employee, ignoring the one-time fees to hire, is about $1.50 an hour, so I don't know where you're going with that. As long as each employee makes more than his/her wage + appx $1.50, they pay for themselves. Turning enough money to keep the place running is all about having a business that is any good. Imagine a small restaurant that staffs about 20 people that turns an average till of about $1,500 dollars a night. Say these employees average real hourly cost was $11.50. That averages to $221.00 in employee expenses a night. Leaving the remaining funds of $1,280. Plenty to cover space rent and utilities and raise a sizeable profit. If he hires the third person and benefits have to be paid to everyone, he would need 3 products from each person. Now, the workers have to work harder in order to sustain their new benefits. Again, the odds are that there are no extended benefits for a small business, and that which there are are based on the wage and hours of the employee particular, not by the amount of employees. Which you will gladly take from the owner and give to the workers Right.	0

An evolved specie wouldn't do things simply because it can.  I don't mean that the reason we do anything is because we can, I mean that the cause is because we can. For example, I don't go to Disneyland for the reason that I can, but I can if I choose, because I can. Slightly confusing, but I wasn't sure how else to word it. If man can create atom bombs and destroy cities and kill people, it doesn't mean he should. Is-Ought distinction. Again, I'm not saying we should do it for the reason that we can, just that we can because we are able to. Mankind, if calls itself evolved, developed, superior and more intelligent than other specie on earth, bears a moral responsibility to not indulge in acts of greed and harm other creations. That's my point.  I had an inkling, but I didn't want to straw man you. This raises a question then. Do you believe in objective morality?	Do you believe in objective morality? Yes. Even murder is not wrong. But you can't live in a world with objective morality, can you? You obviously have to create systems to live on this planet. Murder is wrong not because it is immoral, but because it was necessary for the survival of the human specie, which includes dignity, peace and satisfaction of mankind (because even if murder is legal, human specie will still survive).  For the same reason, mankind should be caring about other creations and the planet in general because it does not live in isolation from them. The animals and the environment are a part of us. For the survival of mankind it is important to bear a moral responsibility towards them and NOT harm them.	0
"To the claim that God doesn't help ""those who won't work and support themselves."" Are you saying that 47 million Americans aren't working and trying to support themselves? The knee-jerk response to any social welfare program, is that the people are lazy and not hard working. I concede that there are those who are lazy, good-for-nothing people out there. But I wouldn't say that there are 47 million of them. These are people with jobs and are struggling to pay the rent and put dinner on the table. The fact that no one admits or sees is that not everyone has the same opportunities as others. It's a matter of chance where we land. Should they be punished for happenstance? Last, the question asked not what we would want. It is what would God (or Jesus or Allah or whatever deity most people believe in) do?"	First of all, that 47 million number is completely bunk. here's why... - 7 million are illegal immigrants. - 9 million are on Medicaid - 3.5 million are already eligible for government programs - Approximately 20 million have, or live, in families with incomes greater than twice the federal poverty level, or $41,300 for a family of four. That's 39.5 million people who shouldn't be eligible for medical insurance (they are illegal immigrants), who are already on government medical, who have no clue that they could be on government medical, or who choose to not accept the medical plans their employer provides. I admit - of those 20 million there are people who don't have it because their employer doesn't offer medical insurance or the premiums are retarded. In this case, the government simply needs to open up competition and force employers to offer medical insurance. In the end - after accounting for these numbers, you find that only 7 million or so have no coverage - much lower than the 47 million people talk about. Does god want illegal immigrants - who often time contribute nothing to our tax base - to be covered by people who responsibly got citizenship and work legally here? My guess is no. Does god want people who are on medicaid or could be on government assistance, to be covered by some arbitrary universal plan that would act as a redundancy only? Probably not. Also, while some people are dealt with crappy situations, people make their own luck. People are presented opportunities all the time. They just choose to not accept them for psychological reasons (low self-esteem, self-worth, etc...).	0
Firstly the reason why the process of the death penalty can be lengthy is mainly because of the appeals that follows which are made by the defendant after being convicted. The burden of proof and the emphasis of the trial is based on whether or not the defendant is innocent or not. All trials are fast as guaranteed by the constitutional right which states that the defendant is entitled to a fair or speedy trial. Again it is the appeal process and not the conviction process that lengthens the time which is made by the request of the defendant and not the state. I do think the prison system will cause less money because almost all of the country's prison systems are overcrowded and this will cause an increase in new buildings for prisons, increase in annual maintenance fee, increase in finance to take care of the elderly and the sickly in prison, and also an increase in the expenses to provide meals and as we are aware many people commit crimes to go back to prison. One of the other main factor also with the overcrowded prison is that once the prison becomes overcrowded many prisoners are released back in society without even serving their time fully which can contribute to an increase in crime and social disorder. And according to a report released by The U.S Dept. of Justice, these have caused the country billions of dollars per year to maintain and control prisons which so far have had little effect. Regardless of whether or not abortion suffers from none of these drawbacks to me does not matters. What matters is the taking of the life of the fetus which i believe is and should be equivalent to the offense of murder or homicide. These young lives have committed no crime and we can make it seem as if they are not really lives but the fact is they are as proved in several scientific researches and the ruling made by the Supreme Court that life begins at conception. We are desperate to execute or imprison a person who commits murder regardless of whether or not it is a lengthy process but when it comes to abortion we talk about freedom of choice and a woman's right to control her own body along with it is a fast process?	I agree with your entire first paragraph. Your second one, however, is just plain wrong. The very existence of capital punishment costs far more than simply containing the prisoners would. This isn't really up for debate. Yes, the prisons are overcrowded and inefficient. As for abortion, there's no sense arguing with you here. Not because you're necessarily right, but because judging from the strength of your convictions, you don't seem like you're going to change your mind any time soon. (Yeah, I hate it when people tell me that, but I just don't feel like wasting even more time on this site. Go look at someone else's response.)	0

Nothing is ever free. What people mean by free medical care is that other people should pay for their services (i.e other taxpayers). I don't want my tax money to be used to pay for other people's services - I'd rather just pocket it, save it, and use it for when I need it.	Don't think I'm telling you you're wrong, because it's idiotic to say someone's opinion is wrong, but think about this hypothetical please. Say you were a lower class citizen, to the point where you weren't able to put food on the table some nights. You pay your taxes, because you're a good citizen but then you become deathly ill and the hospital services cost more than you make in a week. Would you want your tax money that you gave for others who might need it to be used at this moment? It's an ideal of a community of sharing. I accept that you would rather not share, because I too want to be stingy sometimes, but if it could save your life later, wouldn't it be good to share?	0

A long distance relationship may not be desirable despite the love they share. If love is the only priority in the above situations, then Love lead to the break up. Like moving away to send money back home to your lover, or committing a crime for the benefit of your lover may cause an agreement to not be sexually committed(ie a break up) so that they may have their needs for romance and such fulfilled. Such a break up is love sacrificing the committed relationship for the benefit of the lover. It is possible to be in love, and break up. Due to the above situation and others. Often times lovers break up because a difference in sexual desire lead to trust issues. Other times because of the stresses from a occupation, like being a soldier. etc etc.  What relevance does the ratio of births to divorces have?	0
Escapism is bad for the development of a person. Ones personality should be based on reality, that means through facing issues and solving or accepting them, not ignoring them through some mindless activity or fantasy.	accepting them Okay, so let's go with that. Say you've more or less accepted a tragedy in your life. It will still be stressful for a while afterwards, and sometimes it's okay to just...forget, is all I'm saying.	0
Oh okay I get it now. Your one of those people that will deem something 'stupid' when they cannot understand whatever that is as opposed to asking for a better explanation of it or if I can clarify it. It is okay to ask for help, but it is foolish and silly to not acknowledge difficulty and simply define it as 'stupid'	You said humans are stupid. You're a human, aren't you? I just wanted to know where you fit into this idiotic species.	0
"If I say, ""How is it that I can be 10 feet tall,"" the answer is that I'm not 10 feet tall, right? So when you say ""How is it that people can be filled with the Holy Ghost,"" the answer is that they are not. You are comparing height to a spirit of influence. It doesn't work like that. Prove the Holy Ghost doesn't exist. We can't really explain it  Dont try."	Prove the Holy Ghost doesn't exist. No one can prove that the Holy Ghost doesn't exist. Dont try. OK, if we can't explain something, that means God did it.	0
And that doesn't mean that one can't believe in both. I never said you couldn't. You don't use music to solve a math problem but one could still argue that they are related. There are a certain number of notes in a song. There are diffident patterns of notes that equate to certain songs. So it's like trying to separate math and music. I don't understand this analogy. What two things are we talking about here? Are we saying that music = God? Because if you are, at no point in science has anyone ever concluded that something was caused by a non natural cause, because you can't test the supernatural. Well, you are right that we can't find out scientifically how everything was created. So all that we can do is assume. (scientifically speaking) So that doesn't really go against anything I have said. It goes against everything you said, you see, I'm not sure you're understanding what I'm trying to put across. If you assume that something has a supernatural cause, that's it, you're done, you can go home, no more work to do, you can't test the supernatural. If you start off with the assumption that there must be a natural cause, you have to keep testing until you find what actually is the cause. And science is a bit like Scooby Doo. When you pull off the mask, it's always the fucking janitor. Every thing we've investigated has been found to have a natural explanation. It is irrational to believe in something you cannot observe or test using any means. You can't test the supernatural, which is why belief in it requires faith. Faith is irrational because it is to believe something without sufficient evidence. If you have evidence, you don't need faith.	"""I never said you couldn't."" Then what's the point in telling me science is godless?  ""at no point in science has anyone ever concluded that something was caused by a non natural cause, because you can't test the supernatural."" Right, I get that. It's just that atheists often act as though to be religious you have to disregard science. I can believe in god knowing that it was not proven scientifically.  In a debate atheist are always jumping to the whole it can't be proved argument as though I have already said that it could. They sort of assume my belief. That's not very scientific is it.  For the rest of what you have said. We disagree on how one can find truth. I believe that we can receive spiritual answers. You don't. And that's what it all comes down to. There's not a whole lot of debate we can have with that fundamental disagreement."	0

The day of the family living on an acre with their mule are long gone. Today subsidies are only going to the farming corporations like Lucerine who really do not need the money at all. It has become a payoff system whereby farming corporations use these tax payer subsidies to promote candidates who will not change the status quo - ensuring continued subsidies. The only losers are the tax-paying public, and the only winners are those with the means to run their farms without said subsidies.	There is a limit on the amount of money any one group or individual can get. It used to be $50,000, but I'm not aware of the current program. I'm sure there is some way to get around whatever rules are in place. The rich have always found away, tax loopholes. The government has an obligation to make sure there is enough food to feed it's own people, one reason they play a part in its production.  Do you know how little the producer of a cash crop gets out of a box of cereal? Out of a box of cereal that cost $2.69 the farmer gets around 20 cents. The rest of it comes from the processor, trucking, and store markup. Capitalism at it's finest.	0

If you say the decision makers should are legitimate subject for judgment, you must believe they are capable of (self) judgment. This is necessary for you cannot blame for example a child who has no notion of what we consider good and evil. Further, you must believe that there are some universal goods and universal evils we all understand, even in war time, if you want to condemn the actions of decision makers. One such an universal unjust war is for example an aggression war (other than self defense or stopping genocide).  We hold leaders responsible because we believe they should have considered the justice of the war they were starting, whether they did this or not. We wouldn't buy the argument 'no one's perfect' from a president. So why should we buy this argument from a soldier? If one is not standing with the back against the wall or with a gun against his head, there is freedom to act and thus there is responsibility. I agree that the blame must fall mostly on those making the decisions. But I don't agree that soldiers can be dismissed from their moral responsibility. Whether they bear a legal responsibility is another question.	I believe that morality does not exist in Universal terms, but that it is a human creation.  However that does not mean that it does not, or should not exist. We define subjective things all of the time. Numbers are a figment of our imagination but look at all the real life things math and science have created. I only mention that to highlight that just because something does not really exist on a Universal capital T Truth scale, does not mean it is not something we can hold ourselves to. So for our purposes, some things are good, and some things are evil. My position is easier to explain with examples. Say a soldier tortures an enemy combatant on their own without any orders to do so. I am comfortable with others and myself judging that person and holding that person responsible. If the soldier was ordered to do such, then I do not believe I or someone else has a right to hold that individual soldier responsible, but we do have a right to hold the one giving the order responsible however far up the chain that may go. I do think though that a good soldier would hold themself responsible. But it is not my business, and I have no way of understanding the full circumsances if a soldier does not follow orders in a given situation, so it is not mine to judge. So the act is wrong, yes, but the soldier is a tool. If they use free will to go against such an order than I consider them an exceptional person, but it is too much to expect a soldier to not follow orders in certain situations. That said, the US and other Western Nations have overriding laws in place, such as not torturing even if ordered, and not say commiting a hate crime even if ordered to do so. In these instances in Western countries that have rules already established relating to such, soldiers should be held responsible as was the case at Abu Ghraib. But something as general as what we determine later to be an unjust war, you cannot call soldiers murders. They had orders, and nearly everyone was duped. They hold 0 responsibility, all of it must fall on the leaders. Leaders are rarely actually held responisble, but they should be.	0
There is no such thing as objective morality, even in the case of religion. Religious morality has changed many times. Take Biblical morality for example; At one time it was perfectly moral to stone people to death for minor offenses, owning and beating slaves was okay with god, beating your children with a rod for disobeying was touted as a good thing, selling your daughters as slaves and wives was all fine and dandy. Today those things are considered reprehensible. Religion isn't the source of morality, common sense is. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that raping, murdering and stealing isn't going to lead to a happy and prosperous society, which is what nearly every person on this planet desires.	Its funny cause at least God judged people on their conscious actions. Its funny how the same people who say Gods judgements are unfair, are all for the slaughter of unborn children. At least God judged conscious actions.	0
That picture is my new screen saver :D any way it takes just as much faith to claim that there is no god as it takes to say there is a god because neither side can prove themselves 100% correct beyond the shadow of a doubt.	The definition aside, I feel like religion is an organization of worship. Atheist don't worship the belief that god doesn't exist they just accept it. Or rather they refuse to accept the existence of god, and leave it at that. There is no practices or teachings or laws dictating it. There is no hierarchy of atheism it's just disbelief in a divine creator.	0
I will give you a scenerio:  You are married and being physically or mentally abused would you stay in that marriage because you took a vow for better or for worse? And basically saying I am going to die for this fool to show how much they can hurt me?  If you are miserable after a few years and there is no more love so you stay in that marriage because you took a vow that makes absolutely no sense?	Well, it was a vow in marriage. How could you marry a person that you don't trust?	0
I suppose the law is the law. If you murder someone claiming that you didn't know that was against the law, I don't think anyone will have much sympathy for you but if you're from Texas and in NYC on business and a cop catches you smoking in a public park... maybe they should cut you some slack? This debate reminded me of a scene from Seinfeld where George was caught having sex with the cleaning lady on his desk and he tries to claim he didn't know that was wrong.	I would agree with you if there weren't so many laws. More and more every year that we become subject to. And so many things we're required to get permission to do.	0

"I will let you read what the person wrote originally... I was responding to them, but I will also respond to your points. 1) People don't rely on only faith to believe in something they cannot see Why should people rely on faith at all?  2) They rely on accounts, on personal experience, on ethos, on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed If you mean accounts of the events, then they are a good thing to have, but if these accounts are contradictory then how can you trust them? (the gospels are contradictory). Also in Greek mythology there are accounts of the Gods coming down to earth from Olympus, but you wouldn't agree with these accounts. Personal experience is unreliable, people have contradictory experiences. In religious experiences most people would see the Gods they believe in. This does not mean they have not experienced something, but what I am saying is that they are unreliable. That is why scientists use equipment because while our senses are good they are not the most reliable tools to determine what is true about the world. 3) on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed I agree, people should want to know more then what they are told,but this doesn't justify a belief in any part. 4) people whom believe also rely on what they see every day, life; beauty; the universe. I've heard you say this before but never say give examples. I do not know how beauty can be used to justify a belief or the Universe because the universe covers pretty much everything.  5) You're the one stuck in a primitive mindset believing ""There is no evidence"". There is evidence, for many people. Calling my mindset primitive does not do anything for your argument. There is a difference between someone claiming evidence and there being evidence, correct? If someone gives a list of what they call evidence it should be scrutinised to see if this evidence actually holds up, correct? If what they call evidence does not hold up to scrutiny is it still evidence?  6) And you can't see it, that's fine, there's no personal feelings. However, stop with the bullshit mindset that ""because I (you) do not believe, no one else can.""  People can believe what ever they want. If someone wants to believe the earth is flat they can, it is wrong, but they can still believe it. People have the right to believe what they want, I don't disagree with that, but just because people believe something does not mean it shouldn't be questioned, I hope you agree. 7) You're being unfair, like you own this place called THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Get off your high horse. If this is just because you think that I think that no one is allowed to believe something, then hopefully I have already answered that. 8)  All I am doing is questioning your points and why i disagree with them. If you disagree with me respond to my objections to your points."	"Look, man. I'm not going to rewrite my arguments every time someone asks for them. Look around, I'm too lazy to re write them.  Philosophical though, I say the evidence for believing in X, Y, Z god(s) is there. Regardless of ""well which religion or god(s) is correct.""  To be simple, I believe all of them are correct. In that, there are many cultures with different traditions and languages, however, those that believe in the end all believe in the same deity, the same ""god"", as a whole, as one, or many. And so to me it's not a question of ""which god(s) is correct?""  To me it's really a matter of having faith that something is there, or not.  For someone to claim those that do believe are wrong, where is your evidence?  There are many reasons for a person to believe in god(s), and history is evidence as well as many other things, including the beautiful universe.  And so for a person like yourself to continue questioning, sure ask questions, that's fine and encouraged.  However, when it's obvious there is abundant evidence, and you state ""Oh thats not good enough.""  Well then I guess its not good enough for you.  And so until any of these spiritual, god(s), or whatever present themselves to you how you want them to, you will continue to not believe. Which is fine.  There is a fine line between asking questions for the sake of knowledge, versus asking questions just to bash on religious people and tell them ""their evidence is not good enough"".  Move on, you are stagnant."	0
Since 1898, Puerto Rico has been a U.S territory because we won the Spanish-American War, along with the fact that millions of Puerto Ricans are now residents of America, make it even more obvious that Puerto Rico needs to become a state, even though Puerto Ricans have no direct representation. If Americans would just accept Puerto Rico as a state, our nation would benefit enormously from the voices of the Puerto Ricans in Congress. There would be long term benefits of economical advantages and sociological advantages to our nation if Puerto Rico joined us as a State. If Puerto Rico joined us as a state it would have to pay income taxes and that would help boost our rather poor economy, besides aren’t we suppose to be one giant supercalifragilisticexpialidocious melting pot?	For one thing, all you talked about is how we would benefit from Puerto Rico becoming a state. What about them? There aren't nearly as many benefits or the Puerto Ricans as there are for us. It harms their culture, one of the biggest things in Puerto Rico. They would have to make English their primary language when only about a quarter of Puerto Ricans speak English fluently. Teaching the majority of the population how to speak English wouldn't be an easy task and it definitely affects their culture. The Puerto Ricans would also be hurt economically. Although we (Americans) may gain from this new state, it would just hurt them because there is a significant difference between their economy and ours. Their wages and bills are exceptionally smaller than ours. A sudden transition to higher bills could create economic unstableness for the Puerto Ricans therefore causing more problems for the United States because we would have to make up for the problems there. Making Puerto Rico a state wouldn’t be nearly as easy as you make it seem, especially since we are dealing with plethora of people who do not want to become part of the United States of America. They would much rather stay on their own. So think about it, is it worth putting all of the states effort into making Puerto Rico a state when its own people don’t want that?	0

In theory sure. But the freedom of speech thing is only the way it is because it had been shown that allowing people to say anything they wanted could be potentially dangerous and that the right was not absolute. You would have to make a similar case for freedom of religion. And as of yet I don't think any one has made that point to the proper authority's I have heard such reasons but its not up to me what it means so it doesn't make much of a difference if I have or not.	You either have the right or not, if the constitution says you have the right to unabridged freedom of speech an this has been interpreted in a way to abridge that right then freedom of religion can be interpretated similarly. If not then talking about being an Atheist is covered under freedom of speech. Either way being and expressing that you are an Atheist of whatever is covered under the constitution.	0

This is just another example of religion trying vainly to survive by adapting to a changing world. Religion has been evolving all along and will continue to do so. I'd rather religion evolve and adapt. It is clear that less and less people each day are okay with accepting the rediculous theory of God as well as the teachings of christianity as they were written in the bronze age. There is more than one ridiculous theory of god, one of which is that god doesn't exist. God might be described poorly, but god exists at the very least as an idea. The only way for religion to survive is to change it's deffinitions to be more compatible with modern humanity's intellegence by creating philosophic bullcrap scenarios in which a god COULD exist. The only way for humanity to survive is to improve the way it practices religion. That you want to argue against an improved view of these concepts is clear. In reality these new definitions completely run astray from the initial religions, which is exactly what this is doing. The initial religions? You talk about religion as if it's not an ongoing process subject to change over time. Christianity is not today what it once was. Tomorrow Christianity will be different than today, So will you, but we'll still call you AveSatanas It isnt christianity anymore if god is an idea in our heads (which he is). That's like saying that if I remove a brain tumor from your head, you won't be you anymore. And BTW admitting that god is an idea in our heads is dangerously close to conceding. Christianity is a belief that God is a tangible being that can not only interfere with our world, but created it. Christianity is a group of people that for various reasons decide to identify as such. Some of which are atheists. Saying anything other than that is corrupting the belief. That's the kind of thinking conducive to religious stagnation	"Religion has been evolving all along and will continue to do so. I'd rather religion evolve and adapt. Yes it has. Which i say is proof enough that it is unreasonable. If the core original belief set is non-applicable to today's modern standards, then any fraudulent sugar coating of it should be as well. Id rather religion be done away with alltogether. Beliefs supported by nothing have no place today. They will continue to adapt because that is the only way theyll stay alive. People will always be stupid enough to believe religions even if theyre kind of ridiculous. But if a religion is REALLY bad then people will trash it. If people taught the same christianity today that they did 2000 years ago, NOBODY would be christian.  There is more than one ridiculous theory of god, one of which is that god doesn't exist. God might be described poorly, but god exists at the very least as an idea. I agree. I nor any wise atheist will ever state that ""there is no god. period"". That is not entirely truthfull because nobody knows that for sure. Nobody can prove it. Then again they also cant say there is a god for the same reasons. But we can reject the notion of god on the grounds of logic and analyzation of the information we do know. What we can do is say there is PROBABLY and i mean like 99% sure theres no god based on a variety of evidence. And the existence were talking about is what he is described as. A physical existence. he will always be an idea, but thats it. A figment. The only way for humanity to survive is to improve the way it practices religion. Woah woah woah. Slow down there. Humanity? Humanity is NOT dependent on religion at all. Not for survival by any means. Sure every culture in history will dream up its own way to explain things they cantfully explain, but its not like without these deities they would all DIE. That's absurd. In fact, religion mostly causes damage to humanity. If anything it hinders survival. It causes wars, suicidal practices, and more. It's unhealthy by and large.  A more accurate statement would be that ""the only way for RELIGION to survive is to improve its practices"". Less and less people everyday are following religions. If these religions didnt adapt to changing times and still taught bronze age ideologies, the numbers of people leaving would be even more staggering.  That you want to argue against an improved view of these concepts is clear. Well i know that that is the only way religions are able to stay afloat today. That, combined with a lack of knowledge in general. Im just saying that by changing the core belief set youve created a new religion. Its not christianity, its neo-modern psudochristianity. And if regular old 2000 year ago christianity isnt good enough anymore, how can you believe the altered version? The fact that it CAN be altered shows how its just all made up. Heres an example. You cant change a non fiction piece of work. Certain ones that is, of course knowledge changes with time but lets just say something liiikeee...a non-fiction report on the water cycle. We know how the water cycle works. Theres nothing more to learn. You cant add onto it over time. In 20 years the water cycle will still be the water cycle. The fact that nothing more can be added to it says that it is true. We figured it out, theres nothing more to know. That's it, boom. If in ten years someone tries to say that water cycles backwards or something, theyll be ridiculed because that just isnt true. With religion it's ever changing. By being able to add onto it in the future over and over shows that the original core of it is untrue to begin with. If something is true its true. Thats it, nothing more to it. If it was true 2000 years ago its true today. By changing the religion it's saying that 2000 years ago it was NOT true. Which then says that everything added to it continuing through today is also untrue.  Like the cat in the hat. He isnt real to begin with. Now lets say the author changes the story and puts him in modern manhattan and draws him more realistically with a more real story line making him a business man. The cat in the hat is STILL not real. Which means this improved storyline is also NOT real.  People need to recognize this. You cant change a truth.  The initial religions? You talk about religion as if it's not an ongoing process subject to change over time. Christianity is not today what it once was. Tomorrow Christianity will be different than today, Yes the initial religions. Like in my example, it would be the original cat in the hat story. It is subject to change over time but by changing it you essentially create a new religion that should be renamed. Christianity is what was practiced 2000 years ago right after the bible was published. When it was changed, the name shouldve changed too. And today it should be called The Touchy Feely BS Sugar Coated 2013 Christian-Type Belief Set Version 2.0. Because it is NOT christianity. So will you, but we'll still call you AveSatanas Yes but any addition to me doesnt not make me who i am. I was born. My existence is factual. But because i gain a piece of knowledge, or because i break my arm doesnt not make me ME. Religion is untrue from the start, then when you make drastic changes to the core of it it becomes something new and exposes it as untrue.  Christianity is a group of people that for various reasons decide to identify as such. Some of which are atheists. Christianity was practiced 2000 years ago. And wtf? Some atheists are christians now? OK. I mean, the only way an atheist could be a ""christian"" would be if he/she was in the closet about it and gave themselves the false label of ""christian"".  That's the kind of thinking conducive to religious stagnation If a religion is to be reguarded as ""true"" then it cant change. It MUST stay stagnant otherwise it broadcasts to everyone that A) it is unfit for modern belief and B) that it is untrue from the inside out. Of course they never will stay stagnant, otherwise theyd die out. And i think you understand me wrong. I dont want religion to stop changing. I want it to die. Belief in ANYTHING unsupported by even a little bit of evidence is unfit for a modern world. Humanity needs to stop accepting non answers to it's questions about the universe and world around us.  The bronze age is where these absurd beliefs shouldve stayed instead of weaseling and morphing to carry up through the years as a parasitic lie."	0

Actually, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are 3 separate sects who all identify with the God of Abraham. Thus, this god who has told the pope to tell you that Atheists can now get into heaven is the same God that the Jews have and Muslims have. Which is another great reason not to believe the garbage spewing from their mouths.	Islam believes totally different from what Christianity and Judaism has to offer because Christianity and Judaism believes in Jesus Christ but Islam denies that Jesus died on a cross or rose from the dead and they state many things that happened which are false. They believe in a different god.	0

They are the same concepts just different variations. My point is that without belief in the money you are using it's practically worthless in every form. In fact I would see the squirrel pelts as something worth more then paper or bits and bytes. It has practical use as well as trade ability. Money works off a belief factor nothing more. It is the cause of the majority of problems in society (because everyone wants a piece) and one day people will realize... you can't eat money.	It's true that money only has value because people agree that it has value. A dollar used to represent a certain amount of gold, but we got off the gold standard and people barely noticed. One day, it will all crash. But since we aren't there yet, please send me money.	0
Dictators might not be all that good, but as soon as they're over thrown, the whole country descends in to chaos. There are plenty of examples, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, and soon to be Syria, among many others. SO having a dictator wouldn't be as bad as having a monarch, who is much more powerful and has many other powerful friends around the world. People will say a Monarch is better, because they associate them with first world countries. Wrong!	Monarchs had a much better establishment of power. Also they had a larger span of influence.	0

A cannibal is someone or something that eats the flesh of it's own kind, if you only drink blood you are not a Cannibal but you could technically be a Vampire	Oh, and drinking human blood is a form of cannibalism, it is cannibalism. You are feeding off of your own kind, you are eating your own kind. Doesn't matter if you eat or drink, you consume it either way. If you rendered meat a powder, mixed it with lots of blood and drank it then that would also not be cannibalism?	0
I beleave that this new police is inconsiderate to the stundent body it self. There are many different reason why a person should have more then thirty min to go home after a event. For one, some people dnt have rides that can be there right on time because of the distance they live from the school, or just pure traffic. so why should the stundent be faulted by a officer because they live out of area.	well i understand that traffic and getting a ride may be an issue, but the solution to this problem is really simple... all you need to do is just leave the campus. walk across the street and grab something to eat from the store and wait for your ride there; or something of that nature. Just dont be on school grounds, thats all.	0

"Its dates often contradict as well as the numbers of troops and usually has some supernatural thing tacked onto it. It isnt a trustworthy source for that kind of information especially compared to historians writings Two different authors. Two different perspectives. Many translations. Typical Atheist. Yeah not really! The old testament doesnt really have anything describing the daily life of the average Jew and the new testament just follows jesus around. Again, historians reports are far better. I clearly said it touches on that. These authors wrote things to the public and to churches which pretty much gave a description of their lives. So again, think for at least 5 seconds. Ill grant you this one, however i again need to mention that it isnt specific to the bible. The historians writings have culture in it too. You act like I am saying the bible is better. Or that history books don't have the information.  It doesnt really say more than ""Cain brought a sheep for slaughter"" so i guess it does say they raised sheep. but the historians actually have accounts of what crops are grown where and what livestock are raised, their farming techniques, and so on. The bible does mention plants and stuff so.....idk. no like relations with other countries and nations. The bible doesnt really talk about government and politics at all and it often gets relations with other nations wrong. There were never any masses of jews in egypt for example. So another point for historians whos main bulk of the writing is about politics and government works. What if historians were wrong? What if the bible is wrong? Idk. I don't care. No, its inaccuracy makes it lose all accuracy. When it stacks up to the facts it usually fails. Dude, its an account of the perspectives of different people. So its accurate.  Correction. Someone was writing down what they thought people said about people who may or may not have existed and what they may or may not have thought they saw or heard. And anyways THEIR perspective isnt really important when you gather that they believed in a space wizard who birthed a son that did magic tricks. They sort of lose credibility. Space wizard? What the hell? Typical Atheist. A wizard is not a god. God is supposed to be outside of space and time. He is not a space wizard. Why do you guys always just go for the insults? And perspective is important if you want to know what people think. Not compared to the accurate writings of historians as well as government records from nations. The spiritual ramblings of ancient jews in a holy book isnt a credible source even if it does get a couple things right. Yes it is. Its a personal account from the jews. Its still a personal source of info from a perspective. We dont want snip bits. Snip bits of fact among non-facts are not credible when compared to almost completely factual accounts Example: Bible: Courtney fell. History book: Courtney was running from wolves. She tripped over a large stick and fell and got devoured.  Still sounds fine to me. Sounds like they just left out some information. I really don't care. Courtney still fell. If we can A) prove that person actually wrote the book. and B) That what they saw or heard wasnt only what they THOUGHT they saw or heard. So then scientists can study it and figure out what made them think that. Still works as a source of study too. Yes but in different ways. Im talking about where it is best to go to get facts about a whole range of topics from a trustworthy source. That would be from historians. If you want some fact and culture mixed with deluded perspectives about unfactual happenings then the bible is your source. So again blah blah blah bible is mush. I have heard enough of that. I hope you dont mean that its my CHOICE whether it persuades me If it gets you it got you. Thats it dude."	"Two different authors. Two different perspectives. Many translations. Typical Atheist. WTF? Different perspectives would be: i think that sex before marriage is ok. VS i dont think sex before marriage is ok. Those are two different perspectives. But when were talking about hard facts and numbers like the dates of battles and the numbers of troops and casualties then the perspectives dont matter and cannot both be right. They must be the same or one or both is wrong. If there were 2000 troops from the Romans who died in AD300 and that is a fact, and some bible author says there were 1567 troops and the battle was in AD167 THEY ARE WRONG. I dont care what their perspective is. They are wrong. I clearly said it touches on that. These authors wrote things to the public and to churches which pretty much gave a description of their lives. So again, think for at least 5 seconds. It barely talks about daily lives and certainly doesnt go out of its way to describe them. And they arent even average people theyre disciples and priests and such so their lives arent even the average life and once again are full of myths and fabrications. The bible is not a good source for historical information You act like I am saying the bible is better. Or that history books don't have the information. If youre not then why the fuck do you keep arguing with me? I AM saying historians and history books are better than the bible. That is my stance. And if youre opposing me then logically i assumed you were claiming the bible is better. If they is NOT your stance then what is? If it is the stance that the bible CAN be a good source SOMETIMES then fine, thats reasonable and im not arguing with that. However i am claiming that almost anything within the bible can be found from more trusted and factual sources more easily, and therfore, makes the bible inferior. The bible does mention plants and stuff so.....idk. Yeah barely like: Abel brought some corn. Well thats great but it doesnt tell us about any other crops, their farming techniques, their planting seasons, their agricultural impact on the economy, ect. Historians texts do. What if historians were wrong? They could have been but often are not because we have many other documents that confirm their writings as well as archeological evidence that supports them. They still could be wrong, but its easier to trust the guy whos JOB it was to keep a factual account then some guy who isnt concerned with facts whos writing mainly about fairytales and myths.  What if the bible is wrong? It usually is. (skepticsannotatedbible.com) Idk. I don't care. You dont care? You dont care that what you might read and believe could be wrong? I care. I care alot. I make sure that i can honestly say at the end of the day that everything i believe to be true it accurate and supported by evidence. Can you say that? Dude, its an account of the perspectives of different people. So its accurate. What is it with you and this perspectives thing? I dont care what person A THOUGHT he saw. I care what he ACTUALLY saw. And how does someones perspective automatically make it accurate? What if i THINK i saw a pterodactyl but it was actually an airplane? My perspective that it was a pterodactyl is WRONG and not accurate at all. It was a plane. End of story.  Space wizard? What the hell? Typical Atheist. A wizard is not a god. It was an insult not meant to be accurate. However i actually do think its accurate. He apparently exists way up in space or beyond space and time and influences things using unseen magic. Ie: Space wizard. God is supposed to be outside of space and time Yup, where the church stuck him. Far beyond the reach of any science....yet. You think god was always there? No. Thousands of years ago he was on a mountain. Well we went up that mountain: no god. So they put him in the clouds. The Wright brothers come along, we get planes go up there: no god. So they stick him above earth out in space somewhere. Well damnit we go and make space shuttles and satelites. What do we find? No god. So damnit they stick him in the one place NOBODY can go: outside space and time. Funny isnt it how he gets farther and farther away with every scientific discovery? Every gap they stick him in gets smaller or disappears. Think about it Why do you guys always just go for the insults?  Why does anybody insult anything? Because we think its stupid and worthy of insult. Dont take it personally And perspective is important if you want to know what people think. But i dont give a shit what people think!! Especially people who were gullible enough to think that a magical man in the sky granted wishes! All i care about is what is TRUE and ACCURATE and testimony from the kinds of people found in the bible are NOT trustworthy BECAUSE they are almost always inaccurate.  Yes it is. Its a personal account from the jews. Its still a personal source of info from a perspective. What is it with you and personal this and that and perspectives of this that and the other guy? I dont care whos testimony it is and from whos perspective it's written from. Unless what is contained in it is FACTUAL thier perspective doesnt matter!  For example: Say a battle happens between 200 Romans and 300 Visigoths in AD350. Perspectives are written from the roman side and the visigoths side. Both perspectives get all the facts correct the number of troops, the date, the casualties, ect. are consistent with each source. Since this is so THEN the perspectives of each can be looked at to see what their opinions of the battle were. However, if some Visigoth text talks about a battle in AD670 between 500 romans and 10 visigoths who won, their perspective doesnt matter because the battle never happened (Rome fell long before that). Plus we can deduce that theres no way 10 visigoths defeated 500 romans and that this story is a non factual myth.  SO when we have factual accounts from Egypt showing ZERO signs of a large group of jews living with them, rivers turning to blood, their army chasing them as they escaped through the red sea, and their army and Phoaroh dying in a great watery death then i dont care what they Jews say in some holy book! Its wrong!! never happened! Example: Bible: Courtney fell. History book: Courtney was running from wolves. She tripped over a large stick and fell and got devoured. Still sounds fine to me. Sounds like they just left out some information. I really don't care. Courtney still fell. Nu nu nu nu no. That is way off.  Example: Bible: Courtney fell because God poofed a magical rock in front of her because she was an adulterer and needed to be put to death. Historical text:  Notice the history text says nothing. Why? Because theres nothing anywhere in any factual historical text where this Courtney person ever existed or a magical rock spawning into existence. So then scientists can study it and figure out what made them think that. Still works as a source of study too. Why would any scientist care what some ancient jews thought they were seeing? 1) we have no way to prove these people ever existed. 2) we can only speculate on what (if anything) they might have seen. It isnt worth studying people in the past like that, we can just study people today who think theyve seen things they havent. Like people who claim to have seen bigfoot or ghosts. We have access to people like this today so we can study them and apply what we find to people then. However id pretty much just say they never existed and if they did then they were really gullible and believed whatever they were told and probably didnt even witness anything meraculous. But thats me So again blah blah blah bible is mush. I have heard enough of that.  If you want some fact and culture mixed with deluded perspectives about unfactual happenings then the bible is your source that's not at all what i said. And if youve heard enough then leave If it gets you it got you. Thats it dude. Smart people dont let things ""get"" them. I hear things and then think critically about them and if need be i research about them to validate or falsify them and if they are validated then i accept them. I dont get swayed by shitty appeals to emotion or authority nor do i ever just believe everything im told."	0
The only way that will happen is if enough republicans are elected. You'll notice the majority of experts, and all experts not in the pocket of some right wing think tank funded by the Koke brothers, agree that the economy is and has been getting better for four years now.	I admit it is getting better. But it doesn't matter whether it was Republican or Democrat. The mood of the nation shifted, which makes the market shift. But with current situations and the debt, it may get worse. Here is what some are predicting. The Euro zone collapses, nixing the Euro from the market. The currency many will fall back on will be the dollar. Our economy will be aboomin'! Our dollar will skyrocket in value and every American will be happy. However, now with the markets in Europe shattered, the only markets will be Asia and North America. Here is where some disagree. Asia controls almost all of our debt, and they will want it paid in full. We probably won't be able to since we will be still recovering our own economy. Dollar goes down and shit hits the fan. Others think that after this boom, the dollar will start on a downward trend due to a desperate global economy. Then we are back to square one, and even worse off. That is the fear some have.	0

It is a real question. And that their Vampire doesn't mean when can't kill them all. They have pointy teeth. Try to get close to me when I have a gun.	"Vampires have more than ""pointy teeth."" For one, they have the ability of rapid cell regeneration which makes your gun entirely useless. They also have the ability to more rapidly restore their health by drinking blood. They can also grow their population more rapidly by converting humans (whereas humans must reproduce and children must survive to adulthood to reproduce). In most mythologies vampires also have the ability of transfiguration, particularly into bats or wolves, and may also be able to control animals (usually wolves). They are also reputed for having strong seductive powers which is certainly to their aid. Further, there are repeated claims to greater agility and strength and intelligence. Do you know what humans get? A mixed mythological record that says garlic, crosses, and holy water might ward off the vampires (note, not actually aid in killing them in any way). Oh, and wooden stakes which are considerably more unwieldy than the myriad weapons vampires could use against humans (e.g. the gun). Finally, sunlight, which considering they can arguably command animals to their defense and take safe sanctuary does not count for much (particularly when you consider how poorly adapted humans are to the night)."	0
Imagine a species is divided, for whatever reason. Perhaps a flash flood has changed the flow of a river, perhaps a drought has caused the species to range further for water and divide themselves, perhaps a food shortage has done the same. Perhaps there is a combination of multiple reasons that cause a species to divide into two separate populations that are physically removed from one another. They are still the same species. One group of the species is living under very similar conditions to the original biome; the other group is under somewhat different conditions. The former group is already fairly well adapted to the biome, but the latter group struggles to survive. The latter group is shaped by stronger (relative to the species capabilities) and more importantly different selective pressures. Now, give it time. As the different conditions favor different traits, the two populations begin to diverge. Given enough time, the group under different conditions will eventually change to the point where they are no longer genetically compatible with the original group. Now, we have two different species- one evolved from the other, while the ancestor lives on.	Humans are a different species from apes. We are classified as coming from a relative family. We may have had a common ancestor but under your reasoning we are the same species as a bacteria. Science has deduced the earliest life to single celled organisms that do indeed follow the pattern you describe but let me tell you. We did not evolve from apes. You just spewed to me a lot of mumbo jumbo that makes no sense to the debated question. DID HUMANS EVOLVE FROM APES? now... did we evolve from an earlier ancestor that was a different species then?... and is what we see a strong relationship tree between us, apes and other mammalian apelikes? (baboon for example) if yes, then we did not evolve from apes.	0

Guns shouldn't be banned because then the people who follow the law won't be able to protect themselves from the ones who don't.	Think about it. It's not the 60s anymore. Thousands or Russians aren't going to go marching up the street and slaughter your family. Most shooting deaths in home invasions are caused by the guns of the owners, taken by the burglar, either when they have found it in their house or when the owner of said gun has tried to protect themselves with it and had it turned on them. Sure, even if guns are outlawed violent crime will not stop. But it will still be the same amount of violent crime, less home invasion deaths and less school shootings. Like I said, think about it.	0
Fantastic, well you may not get much help from me being an atheist, but are you genuinely surprised? You thought God was going to take special care of you? Look at the world, it's far from a perfect place, why should you receive perfect treatment. I know from your point of view, life has always been all about you, other people (including me now) are just other things, but the exact same experience your having of life is being experienced by billions of others. So why should you in particular be looked after. God is not a perfect being, ever since mankind was created he has been maltreating us horrendously! You want happiness? You want to live a full happy life? Stop worrying about God all the time, I am not saying denounce your faith, I very much doubt that would happen, just stop worrying about what you don't have and start considering what you do. Now, that's about as pretentious I can get without bursting in to a rage why God is not real, and if he did he would be the biggest mass murdering villain ever yadda yadda yadda. Way I see it, you're not happy now, but later on if you re-read this you'll probably laugh at how silly you sound, or feel ashamed at how you were parading your problems on the internet. By then whatever you feel sad about will have passed. Oh well, that's a little of what I think, but you don't have to listen :D	How can you be an atheist if you are angry at God? You have to believe in someone to be angry at them. I counter that you are indeed an intellectual theist. No, that is not an oxymoron. Thank you for caring though.	0
All of your facts say that video games help. At least that's what I gather. The definition of effect is is a change that is caused by result of an action. If playing the video games means that kids are less likely to join gangs, then it had an effect on them, a positive effect. I understand your point though. Games aren't going to make kids bad, but as the debate says does it affect them, it technically does by acting as an outlet.	He is talking about does it cause violence I am taking it	0

Do you mean is it used to describe things, that really shouldn't be called 'Art' often? Hell-to the-yes! Did you see any of the recent Joe debates about artists? A man sold a drawing that looked like a kindergartner's finger painting, for over 37 million. That said, I do think the word art is thrown around a lot, but rightfully so. Anything could be considered art if you can call it self expression, and someone can take something from it. This, what we're doing now, is art to somebody.	But art by nature is irreducible and doesn't require skill or knowledge, that's why it's art.	0

You don't really have a good time scale on recovery do you. With modern technology Europe is still repairing farms destroyed in world war one. A war that no one I will ever meet can remember. That with modern technology and the combined effort of all of Europe's resources. . Now jump back a bit. Feudal Greece. A number of isolated City governments ruled by selfish Feudal lords who care little for the common folk as a rule and have little mobility in their mountain terrain. Not only that, but after Athen's hijacked the Deliem League and turned it into an empire All of the Atican civilizations have 0 trust and cooperation with their economic hub. How quickly do you think they recovered. Distrust in Greece tended to last centuries. They knew how to hold a proper grudge. Some of the Rivalries predate the Alpha Beta system of writing and lasted into the time of Rome, especially with Thebans	I don't think countries were turned to slush by artillery in feudal greece, or were turned to slush again just a few decades later, plus european countries are at the top of the HDI so i'd say they've recovered Plus we are talking about Macedon, the rest of greece was always fighting and some city states lived for war. Plus politics has nothing to do with a battle, only numbers.	0

First of all, just because your childhood wasn't perfect doesn't mean that all the other people who have a good time at Christmas should go without due to your trauma. Secondly, you are right, the Christmas tree comes from the Woden worshipers who used the evergreen as a symbol for life as everything else died during the harsh Scandinavian winters. Finally Jesus was born in September/October time not December 25 which was a pagan holiday celebrating the sol invictus. In conclusion, don't be such a stick in the mud!  Pedophiles will usually work around children if they can and banning Santa will not reduce anything noticeably except the happiness of the holiday spirit	"""just because your childhood wasn't perfect doesn't mean that all the other people who have a good time at Christmas should go without due to your trauma."" I am not THAT selfish- I did not experience any trauma by discovering that Santa was not real. (I did however, anger my parents and my first elementary teacher when I yelled out to the class and all present at my family's christmas party that Santa was all just a scam to get us kids to be good), but I have known various people who don't like the idea of a fictional character being the main focus on Christmas celebrations. In some situations, it can be a bit weird to witness the ways in which Santa Claus has been portrayed. For example, I know a family with 9-15 year old kids who still firmly believe in Santa, the Easter Bunny, and all that sort of thing. I also know a family dedicated to the catholic religion, in which the children have been deliberately been brought up to believe that Santa is bad and is a complete myth. I would like to state that I did not mention pedophiles in my argument, rather, as yet they have only been mentioned by TERMINATOR in the description to this debate, and me and a lot of people my age have said that we would be much happier at Christmas time if Santa Claus didn't exist. I have to admit I wasn't expecting people to take a minor subject like this so seriously."	0

No it is not. Christian beliefs are based on the new testamente. We read the old one .. but our 'book' is the new testamente, while Jew's book is the old. The christian belief is based on that Jesus came down on earth, and died for our sins. That is in the new testamente, therefore christianity is based on the new testamente.	So you're saying Christians believe that the events in the old testament are bullshit lies?	0
"The education system will bombard them with ""evolution is fact"" so it's either your religion or atheism."	I'd just like to point out that just because someone believes in evolution does not automatically mean they're an atheist.  And schools don't bombard them with the theory, at least schools in America. Because the Science classes are poorly done mostly and they barely cover all that they have to anyway. When the do evolution they don't talk about human evolution, but animal adaption mostly. At least the three different biology classes I had in high school didn't. lol	0

No, people shouldn't be locked up for their political views. You are mixing political freedom with economic freedom.

Students should have the freedom to freely skip lessons at school. Do not simply assume that students would skip all classes and just go around doing nothing.

"""The age of consent is necessary to prevent adults from taking sexual advantage of children."" I believe this is why concepts like statutory rape exist, however. Age of consent is hardly necessary between two people of the same or similar ages however. In truth I believe that age limits on sex exist because most parents, indeed many adults seem to have a uncomfortable feeling when discussing or contemplating the subject of teenagers having sex with each other."	That is not what the age of consent is. The age of consent is for a person under 18 and a person over 18 - the law allows two people under 18 to engage in intercourse, +/- about 3 years.	0

"I'm not missing the point about the article. It surveyed 350 people from a country of 316 million with no reference to how they randomized their selection. While that may not negate it's results, the questions posed were hypothetical. People may not want to hire an atheist for a high-trust job, but in reality they won't ask the question. Religious questions aren't asked unless it actually relates to the job. Personal affairs are different. being openly non-theist will more likely than not lead to discrimination What does openly non-theist mean? Do you announce it to people?  I think it's hilarious that you think that asking ones faith before a greeting is somehow less offensive!  It's not about YOU. It's about them. When someone says hello, they are the ones being nice. They aren't saying you should be. It is ridiculous to expect a greeting to be tailor made for every receiver. It doesn't matter if the greeting has religious or cultural meaning, it's not about YOU.  You are right that there is no real point in debating so feel free to have the last word. I would like to be a good sport and wish you a ""Happy Godless Gay day"", but since we are already off on the wrong foot, Merry Christmas. Oh and Happy New Year too!"	This is the first time you actually addressed the link at all, and you are still missing the larger point: atheists are treated with distrust for no reason other than their lack of religious belief. The article presents further research and analysis demonstrating this heightened, unfounded, and irrational prejudice against atheists. This discrimination is a consequence of religious presumptuousness and privilege.  My co-workers freely discuss their religious beliefs, and I do express myself just as freely. I don't declare myself an atheist in antagonism of their expression of belief, but expressing my world views frequently involves at least the implication if not the express statement of my lack of faith. Just as I don't go around announcing I'm queer... but if they can talk about their straight partners, I'm going to talk about my boyfriend.  I hardly see why asking someone their faith preference is offensive. The only reason that would be offensive is if it were asked with presumption that religion is better... and that that seems to be your very implication underscores my very point. Acknowledging diversity in belief, race, orientation, etc. should never be offensive. The only reason it becomes that way is because there is a superimposed presumption of superiority and inferiority. That you observe that holiday and Christmas greetings are not at all about me but about the person giving them undermines your initial point that I should not be offended by an act of good will. If it is just to make them feel good then why the hell should it make me feel happy? Particularly in light of the personal and identity histories I have with the religion they are using for their own self-gratification. Interestingly, you did not address the point about my (out)rage. Perhaps because you belatedly realized I have actually approached this from a practical standpoint? I have only ever advanced a reasonable argument supporting wider tolerance and acceptance, the framework and larger point of which have gone wholly unaddressed by you. If anyone has acted with emotional excess, it would be you.	0
It isn't about what age you are - it is about how high you are. In the frontseat of a car, there is an airbag. If you crash, the airbag reacts and .. you know what airbags do. The airbag can prevent damages that could happen. But let's take a little 9 year old girl. If the airbag goes on, she can choke in the airbag, since she isn't high enough. Her head will not be higher than the airbag, so she will probably choke. This can result death or serious damages. Some say, that you have to be at least 140 cm tall to sit in the frontseat, and some say taller. I think they could sit in front, if you turn the airbag of.	How do you know they will choke on airbags. the old cars usually don't have them. And how do you turn off airbags	0
Well according to the Bible in Psalms 14:1 it says whoever says in their heart that their is no God is a fool. And I obey what the Bible says so of course I think atheism is evil.

"Unless you say that the lack of religion is a religion, then the lack of religion is not included in the ""freedom of religion"", by mere language usage. You would have to have another freedom, which is that of belief, or that of opinion, in order to support anything without a religion. Since the freedom is that of religion, then it follows that the freedom is applying to religion. This does not mean that there is a freedom outside of religion. However, one could argue that the freedom from religion is a subset of the freedom of religion, but neither way shows that both the former and the latter are equivalent."	Once you have chosen your religion isn't someone from another religion hassling you going against your freedom? Wouldn't the freedom of religion then lead to a freedom from religion because you are protected from other religions once you have chosen yours?	0

I'm saying those within the church who get upset at the church for standing it's ground on homosexuality can leave, because the faith is certainly not for them.

No, it is a war. So let's assume that Bush did start the war, which is impossible I might add, Congress has the ability to stop the War. So if your going to blame someone blame the people who voted to go to war. The President doesn't have nearly as much power as you seem to think he does.	"Okay, ""war"" I'm using in shorthand of military conflict. But because early into the war there was the Iraq Resolution. The Iraq Resolution gave Bush the right to go ""use force"" on a number of bases.  ""The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States ""as he determines to be necessary and appropriate"" in order to ""defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.""

A few shells or clippings of squirrel leather aren't worth very much, so it's not surprising that you're willing to give them away. I don't think you'd be so willing to give me a significant sum of money though. Bits and bytes would count, if done officially.	They are the same concepts just different variations. My point is that without belief in the money you are using it's practically worthless in every form. In fact I would see the squirrel pelts as something worth more then paper or bits and bytes. It has practical use as well as trade ability. Money works off a belief factor nothing more. It is the cause of the majority of problems in society (because everyone wants a piece) and one day people will realize... you can't eat money.	0

The thing about Hydro Electric is that since water is recyclable, a system can be set up with in the generator where it can constantly use the same water in order to produce electricity.

It helps us manage our time and work In what universe does it pay off, education-wise, to spend more time chattering away with friends than actually studying for a test or working on an assignment? Another reason why social networking is not beneficial: <a href='http://www.livescience.com/2744-athlete-smarter.html'>exercise helps the mind. If the students are indoors using their computers or laptops to social network, they are neither studying nor exercising: the two things that may help academic performance.	"By saying that it helps ""managing our time and work"", I meant you can become more efficient by completing tasks faster and easier using Social Networking Sites. Yes, I do believe that Social Networking Sites help us save our time and here is the reason why:   If you have your group mates as your friends online, you don't have to drive up to the other end of the city to work on a project together. All you do is you go online and discuss it there. A conference is also a brilliant option for assignments that involve more than two people. This indeed saves a huge amount of time that could be wasted on the road. And faster you complete the task, more time you can have for your exercising and reading and many other things. Does is make any sense?"	0
Anything that is physical contact against a person's will is either rape or assault. In this case it is rape because of the sexual connotation that it holds and would almost 99% of the time lead to at least a little more than just the kiss.	Rape is forced sexual intercourse. Kissing another person doesn't involved penetration.  However, society can define it as an assault. My mind mind connects assault to punching or kicking another person. However, as Merriam Webster stated, that an assault can be a verbal attack. So i guess it really depends on how you define: assault and rape. Everything is perceptional so i guess if you define rape as forced kiss as well as forced penetration, then you are not wrong....then im wrong for disputing you. xD  so complicated.	0

"""I'd say that this is the most stable period since the invention of nuclear weapons. Arsenals are reducing, relations improving (between nuclear countries)."" And yet the Middle East is growing progressively more unstable (dictators, power grabs, disputed territories, corrupt regimes) and the world is just beginning to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. I wouldn't call those circumstances stable. ""If what you say occurs, be assured that it will never go nuclear. MAD is a preventative, not an agitator."" It could very easily go nuclear. MAD didn't really work. We were on the brink of annihilation even with it. The world can't say nuclear bombs aren't a threat until the last is disarmed. ""It has always been thus. That is who we are."" Again, the point stands that what has always been isn't always what is best. ""If something works for 5000 years without catastrophic failure, I'd call it fairly stable."" What would you define as catastrophic failure? Millions of revolutions and rebellions? Billions of lives lost in territorial/resource wars? Economic depression? Poverty? Hunger? Unsustainable living? The list goes on..."	And yet the Middle East is growing progressively more unstable (dictators, power grabs, disputed territories, corrupt regimes) I'd call that stabler than 1942.  and the world is just beginning to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Don't believe the hype. This wasn't even close to 1929. You see many shanty towns in central park? It could very easily go nuclear. No it won't. There is no strategic reason to use nuclear weapons.   MAD didn't really work. Well neither you nor I are living in an irradiated wasteland so I assume that it did. We were on the brink of annihilation even with it. We're still here are we not?  The world can't say nuclear bombs aren't a threat until the last is disarmed. There is no present threat of nuclear war. I don't know when or why you invented this new cold war, but it is a figment of your imagination. Again, the point stands that what has always been isn't always what is best. It's better than a world government without any limit to its power. What would you define as catastrophic failure? Everybody being dead.  Millions of revolutions and rebellions? A world government would culminate in one massive revolution. Besides, revolutions are merely great changes. Without the industrial revolution, for example, you and I would not be conducting this debate.  Billions of lives lost in territorial/resource wars? That is a gross exaggeration. Until relatively recently, there weren't even one billion people alive. Economic depression? I don't see how this could be prevented by a world government. Poverty? Is nationalism somehow the cause of this? Hunger? Same as above. Unsustainable living? And again. The list goes on... Mercifully, you decided not to. The list of problems are not the result of nationalism.	0
It takes a rather generous mind to consider god to be a collection of even questionably sound conclusions, let alone to ascribe logic to those conclusions. If I was ignorant of the fact that logic does not only consist of the well founded variety, I would find this argument convincing. There is nothing logical whatsoever to believing in the existence of a god or gods. So long as we disagree on what an appropriate meaning for the term god is. I would call god more of a collection of unfounded assumptions based upon personal or collective belief.  Our axioms then? God is not an intellectual creation because the term would imply the application of intellect in deducing the existence of the same, something which I find to be remarkably absent in all constructions of deistic belief. God is anti-intellectual and persists against reason. Here you argue as if only well thought out notions are formed within the intellect, and you assert that your notion of god is not subject to reason.	"If I was ignorant of the fact that logic does not only consist of the well founded variety, I would find this argument convincing. Interesting semantic distinction, and I suppose somewhat valid in point. Yet my point stands that logical or not I think it is generous to call such conclusions ""questionably sound"" rather than ""flawed"" or ""unfounded"".  So long as we disagree on what an appropriate meaning for the term god is. The meaning of God aside, believing in something for which one has no proof or reasonable rationale to support the existence of seems an illogical act.   Our axioms then? Axiomatic for some, I suppose, but having only that merit or value with which they are arbitrarily imbued by those who find them to be axiomatic. Here you argue as if only well thought out notions are formed within the intellect, and you assert that your notion of god is not subject to reason. Correct on the first count. Intellect is defined as ""a) the power of knowing as distinguished from the power to feel and to will : the capacity for knowledge; b) the capacity for rational or intelligent thought especially when highly developed"" (Merriam Webster). True intellect is well thought out, a poorly thought out idea is not intellectual it is just an idea. On the second count, my notion of god is that there is no such thing and that ""god"" exists only in the minds of some human beings who embrace something not supported by reason or logic. To have faith in a god is to believe in something that is at worst contradicted by reason and at best unsupported by the same."	0
"He only had more wives because he COULD provide for more, not because he made provision for more. ""Can do"" and ""should do"", even on the most basic moral value system are completely seperate concepts altogether. Again, I think the words monogamous and polygamous are being misused here, and just because humans have tendancy to have multiple partners does not make it effective. It's human nature to punch someone in the face when they are angry, that doesn't mean its okay, or even wise. I should find it paradoxical that a society that exhaults mankind's nature far above the nature of animals cannot even meet that standard, much less surpass it."	"He only had more wives because he COULD provide for more, not because he made provision for more.  One does not do something because provisions are made. Provisions are made because one is doing something or intendeds to do something. And in such cases provisions were made. Often times wives would either have their separate homes or separate bed chambers, which is indicative of such provisions. ""Can do"" and ""should do"", even on the most basic moral value system are completely seperate concepts altogether. Your implying that a women shouldn't engage in polygamy if she so chooses.

I am not even talking about survival of the fittest here. What you don't get is the distinction between acts of survival and acts of greed.  Animals kill animals for survival. ALL ANIMALS do that. You won't find a lion who doesn't kill animals. Humans kill animals for greed. ALL HUMANS don't do that. You WILL find many humans who don't eat/kill animals. Hence, killing animals is NOT for survival. There's a clear line of demarcation between acts of survival and acts of greed. Very clear.	OK, I'll put it like this. The lion kills the zebra because it must eat to survive. The lion is not adapted to farm and sustain zebras. Thus, it must eat what it can find. It doesn't carry out an act of greed because it cannot carry out an act of greed. The human kills the cow because it must eat to survive. The human is adapted to farm and sustain cows. Thus, it doesn't have to eat what it finds. It does carry out an act of greed because it can carry out an act of greed. If the lion had a choice between one zebra or two, I find it unlikely that it would choose the former. I don't disagree that humans carry out acts of greed, that's obvious. We do it because we can, whereas lions and whatnot can't.	0

It also promotes adultery and fornication and other perversions.	"There is nothing wrong with sex before marriage or ""fornication"" as you zealots call it. Sex is a natural thing and marriage is a humanly constructed thing. Animals do not need to marry to have sex so why should we? We are animals after all."	0
"That's really not my argument. Are men socially disadvantaged by these ""stereotypes""? Not like women are, no. Men aren't victims of sex discrimination, sexual harrassment, or sexual abuse in the way that women are. Men don't find their social roles constrained by inappropriate gender norms in the way that women do. So as I have said before, while both genders are to some extent stereotyped by the media these stereotypes are nowhere near as overtly dangerous to men as they are to women, nor are the images of men so one-dimensional. At the same time you have ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" you also have ""The Apprentice."" Men in GQ are clothed; women in Cosmo, just barely. Men do not appear in advertising as ""arm candy"" or as body-parts used to sell unrelated products. So no, by no stretch of the imagination is media stereotyping of men ""just as bad"" as that of women. As an example, look at how Pyg claims with a straight face that ""any psychologist will tell you that women are much more emotionally unstable [than men]."" In fact, pretty much any psychologist will tell you that's just complete and utter bullcrap. Pyg doesn't cite any psychologists, he just adopts this totally erroneous claim as fact because that's how women are represented to the public mind in media imagery, so therefore it must be true. I don't see any equally outlandish claims about the inherent traits of men being advanced. So again, no, by no stretch of the imagination are the effects of media stereotyping of men ""just as bad"" as the effects of the stereotyping of women."	Ok.... 1. Do you blame the media, or the women that allow themselves to be in Cosmo? I mean, it's not like men are MAKING them pose for these pictures. They CHOSE to do it. To me, that's not a victim.  2. The ONLY reason men aren't in mags and tv wearing little to no clothes is because it doesn't sell all that well. The reason? Men are much more visual than women. If women were as visual as men, and enjoyed looking at pictures of men wearing little clothes, believe me, it would be all over the place too.   My point is there is no real victim here. It is win/win/win. The women who do it enjoy doing it, and make money off it. The companies that use the pictures and images sell their product. The men that like looking at the women's pictures like getting the opportunity to look at them. Win/win/win.   I agree women should not be victims of sexual discrimination, harrassment, or abuse (just like men shouldn't either, but it happens). But I don't think you successfully argue that it's directly related to Cosmo magazine.	0
Not mystical? My friend, mysticism is a field yet to be validated. There is no rational reason to believe in mysticism for there is no evidence to support it, as of yet.  Using trained inner energy their punch could reach three fold the amount of a human with their same muscle mass.  Humans are capable of <a href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=extreme-fear-superhuman'>extraordinary feats of strength when faced in dire situations. The guy in that article managed to lift a 3000 lb stock Camaro from a pinned person. The world record for a dead lift is 1008 lbs.  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction'>Wiki Muscle Contraction From the wiki article (the important part):  For skeletal muscles, the force exerted by the muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when a human is exerting a muscle as hard as he/she is consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in that muscle will be firing at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon—the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body. (That was a complicated set of astericks lol) What I think is that the monks have figured out a way to tap into higher amounts of their muscle fibers, as well as possibly some amount of adrenaline to give them a sort of boost. The monks are likely not engaging in anything supernatural. They have simply figured out how to use their body to its full potential. Nevertheless, this is still impressive.	"'As for ""proof"" I’m not sure that is possible with such a subjective metaphysical perspective. Probably, the better question to ask is whether it works for you--or better yet, if it works for those who are into it. In this, it may be helpful to adopt a more sympathetic frame of mind, since adopting a hostile skepticism (i.e., that it is rubbish until proven otherwise) is apt to negate the cooperation of people you will need to observe in order to tell if it ""works"" for them. As with many things, it may ""work"" but not for the reasons they think it does. The asian sensibility which came up with ch’i, does not see things in terms of neatly linear chains of cause and effect, but rather as a tangled web of sanguine human connections (affinities and antipathies) which generate their own complex webs of causation, and their own unique perceptions.' Quoted from a friend. Unlike the bible, you dont have to believe it to feel the effects and you dont need to debunk it either. It is between you and your natural surroundings. And no, Chi can be manipulated at will it would not need adrenaline surge reserves. Watch a documentary by Stan Lee about a monk who punched a dummy witch calculates impact. His punch is equivalent to that of a professional boxer who spends most of his life perfecting that one move, while the monk obviously spent his time doing much much more. Btw, this may very well be natural but just because it seems alien to you so thats why it is supernatural."	0

"Ok. But does free will necessarily exist? No. And thus, why should you think that the free will defense is a good objection to the logical PoE? All that we perceive as being ""evil"" may be only less good than all that we perceive as being ""good"". I hope you know that we do not need the concept of ""evil"" to run the logical PoE. Free will cannot be proved; nor can it be disproved. Are you thus saying that it is a properly basic belief? I'm not God; I can't say for sure, but I don't think for I am a human who values what I perceive as being free will. Which essentially means that the free will defense might not even a sufficient objection to the logical PoE."	"Are you thus saying that it is a properly basic belief? Strictly speaking the concept of free will cannot be used to appropriately defend or offend anything, for it is unprovable.

Eating at home save a lot of money, because the price includes not only food but also rent a table, service, waiters’ salary, and chef skills. So, the prices in restaurants increase several times. And if the price is low, then there is something wrong with quality of food.   Moreover, sometimes eating in restaurant can take more time than preparing meal at home so it can be also time-consumer. People have to wait for a long time until they are served, and food are prepared because it takes a lot of time to prepare some kinds of food. So it’s not always the good way of saving time.	Since more and more people starting to prefer eating out rather than dealing with the hustle of home cooking, the restaurant industry is booming and they can afford to bring the prices much lower.   Also, most workers realize that since their salary depend on the number of hours they work, so they much rather work and earn more money than spend time on cooking. Since they make more money working they can afford to eat in any restaurant they want.	0
It's not like pokemon. A random mutation might be an bird with just a slightly bigger beak. After several generations, that change is a lot more noticeable. That's why Darwin proposed the theory. He saw birds with small beaks starve, and saw the entire population change how they looked, and when the softer food came back, they went back to normal. If the famine hadn't ended, the birds with bigger beaks would have to compete against each other to find mates and avoid starving. It is a very slow, gradual process. I would expect a lot more change in 5000 generations than one or two.  A massive mutation will usually result in a deformed baby, but a small one, like having ears positioned slightly different, allowing you to hear better is just a small one. If anyone can expand on this, go ahead.	You are discussing microevolution, which is true. I am talking about macroevolution where one species becomes another. There is still little to no proof that macroevolution has every really occurred, the fossil record does not show it either.	0

What the actual fuck is this? The fetus doesn't know what life is because it hasn't experienced any of its five senses and has zero knowledge and no personality as yet.

Some people say Happy Holidays because of other reasons, it's not always because of political correctness.	"I realize that someone who practices Judaism or Islam probably isn't going to wish someone a ""Merry Christmas"", which is where the phrase ""Happy Holiday"" comes in handy.

I don't remember Jesus advocating pedophilia, human sacrifice, woman and child beating, murder, mahem, eating people, etc. I sense sarcasm. Jesus advocates child abuse: Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: “He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.” Matthew 15:4-7 Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he’ll give your a big reward. Jesus asks that his followers abandon their children to follow him. To leave your child is abuse, it’s called neglect, pure and simple. Matthew 19:29 Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law. Mark 7:9 Luke 12:47 Jesus okays beating slaves.	I believe when he says to abandon wife and kids (and everyone) he is referring to the fact that when you become a follower of him you'll reach a cross road where the closest people to you will no longer be compatible with you. Like it will turn into a them or me type deal. In other words you don't have to leave them they will want nothing to do with you anymore. It's like if your wife/husband became hard core religious, that marriage is doomed, you will be totally at odds now. But you shouldn't throw her out on the streets either. I doubt Jesus is saying that. Unfortunately Jesus speaks like the Riddler a lot. I have asked christians for a million explainations on passages, sometimes their explainations actually make good sense and make me see things from a different angle, and sometimes i still am unsatisfied with thier explanation. I believe the bible is loaded with a ton of literal passages but also a ton of non-literal ones (unfortunately it's hard to interpret)	0

Can the living God who created heaven and earth lie? Is He cruel and does He like to trick us? Can the one who took the concept of a human being and wrote it genetic code not use language to communicate something that is accurate to us? If He can write a genetic code I seriously doubt He would have a hard time writing something as simple as a book. Is the creator of language unable to communicate using language? Is that omnipotent being incapable of preserving His word. Seriously, if there is a problem with God's word it should be logically obvious that the problem lies with us and not God. Because how does an omniscient being make a mistake? And we all know that we make errors in thinking and judgment all the time.	"The problem does lie with us. Those who claim to speak for God, and the fools who believe them. All religious texts were written by man, who is to say which one is ""God's word"" if any? Don't you find it strange that an omnipotent omnipresent God would have to speak to us through the interpretations of a handful of ancient religious texts passed down through the centuries? For an all-powerful God (if he exists at all) this is an incredibly inefficient method of passing on a message. What prevents him from cutting out the middle-man and telling us directly?  When you can prove there even is a ""God's Word"" to speak of, then we can debate it's veracity."	0

"You say that science considers babies alive, so tell me this: How is it that something that cannot support itself continually, and naturally, can be considered alive? I believe that if the baby has reached an age where it would be able to support itself it should not be aborted, but ultimately the choice should be the mother's. You, me, nor anyone, has the right to force someone to do anything that interferes with their own beliefs and personal interest. Why should the fetus cling, as a parasite (defined as ""an organism that lives on or in an organism of another species, known as the host, from the body of which it obtains nutriment""), to the mother, if she wished it not to be so, and it can change. To sum it up, a quote by Ayn Rand: ""An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn). Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?"""	"How is it that something that cannot support itself continually, and naturally, can be considered alive? Because it is an independent organism that meets all of the criteria of ""alive,"" and because if, at the moment of conception, the unborn were not alive, they would be unable from that moment to grow and develop. Life cannot come from non-life. I believe that if the baby has reached an age where it would be able to support itself The young of most animals are unable to support themselves independently from birth. At what point does self-sufficiency become sufficient? Birth seems a rather arbitrary placemarker in the grand scheme of things.  You, me, nor anyone, has the right to force someone to do anything that interferes with their own beliefs and personal interest. Except when it comes to the wholesale violation of another's right to life. We've started whole wars over that one. Why should the fetus cling, as a parasite [...] to the mother, if she wished it not to be so, and it can change. Well, because about all but 1% of the time, the mother invited it in. Even if you're viewing the mother's uterus as her property from which she has the right to evict tenants, the Castle Doctrine doesn't extend to those guests who, while unwanted, were invited. I suppose I may just be a stickler about personal responsibility, but I think that I would be supported in most other contexts: you can't just kill another human because its existence would inconvenience you. Your liberty does not extend so far as to encroach on others'. To summarize, a quote by Ayn Rand: ""I am a stupid twat whose philosophy was more inconsistent than a twelve-year-old's menstrual cycle. Do not quote me in an argument if you wish to be taken seriously."" c. 1967"	0

Most of this is just assumptions... We can really say anything about the people involved in this scenario. For example, perhaps the teens are genii who are testing the amount acid the railroad can take before it gets completely destroyed. At the very core of this scenario, you must decide whether one life is more valuable than five. Could you really ask someone to make that decision in a split-second to kill their very own grandmother? Really? Yes.	"""You must decide whether one life is more valuable than five"" No, you have to decide on whether the quality of an innocent life is more important than that of people being stupid.  You could not simplify this debate to ""Save one life or save five?"" as we would not have a debate with something so simple. Therefore, from what we do know, we must evaluate the quality of these lives and use what we know to make a decision. So what do we know? Well, there are some people being stupid on the train tracks with no clear value for their lives, and there is an innocent man who is causing nobody any harm and appears to be enjoying life to the full extent he can possibly enjoy it to.  Quality is obviously better than quantity, and because we have such large stakes in the balance, here, we must take quantity out of the equation. When we have done so it becomes clear to me that the debate is plainly ""A man causing no harm VS an idiot"". As we have taken quantity out of it there is no reason to apply the plural.  Thus, we must not take the old man's life as deciding that numbers are more important than quality is futile."	0

If reaction to diversity is learned after birth, then why so much racial tension?

It may be a frequent part of school assemblies and things of that nature, but stereotypes and negative portrayals of other races are rampant in movies and television, either humorously or seriously.  If a negative reaction to diversity is not learned after birth, but rather innate, then why do people exhibit hugely varying levels of tolerance for other groups?

I never said I liked Obama I portrayed him as a disappointment, instead of saying Democrat you like him you should have said Democrat you have no real problem with him Obama sucks. You should have a problem with him. I'm not conservative, and even I can see that. You don't have a problem with him because he is a Democrat. Hillary Clinton (D) is probably going to be president next so that is really going to end the pattern. If she wins, which I don't think she will.	What's funny is I think this is beginning to sound like conservative bias! If she wins, which I don't think she will. So far passed this election the Democrats have the advantage in the electoral map. Virginia which I thought was going to be the most crucial state of the night turns out Obama won that by a higher margin than he won the popular vote therefore Virginia is now more Democratic than the average state, the Republicans have nowhere to go in 2016 unless they get somebody like Rubio to oppose somebody other than Clinton. Also if Bill won I don't see how his wife can't, the electoral map is probably going to turn out similar to 1992 and 1996 with Clinton winning the common red states of Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana and even Arizona if the Republican has a chance of taking traditional Democratic states good for them, but not only does Clinton have the advantage in the Arkansas area the states we expected to be very tight in 2012 turned out to look like average blue states if the Republicans CAN'T take any blue states they will be totally lost in the 2016 election! Overall though I think the map is going to be a mix of 1992 and 1996. As for my thoughts on Obama As I had said before Obama was a disappointment but he still did great things for the country, the affordable health care act was passed under him making him the first president to pass a law for universal health care. Obama repealed Don't ask don't tell! He ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama Bin Laden. And he passed the dream act. The debt is beginning to drop as well. My problem is that he another corporate drone in office the top 1% of Americans own 40% of the nations wealth and Obama won't do anything about it. The corporate tax rate is still the second lowest in the world as well! He has not signed any bill to ban assault weapons. Also he happens to support capital punishment and the war on drugs!	0

However I am arguing really is that, there should be no issue using the term happy holidays, it is a tad rude to say merry Christmas when you don't know what holiday they are celebrating, but to me I only see it as a little lacking in courtesy.	I was watching the O'reilly show on either monday or tuesday; dec 2 or 3, and he interviewed a guy whose organization, based in Arizona, defends schools who acknowledge Christmas and fight the lawsuits and get them dismissed. The guy said most schools and organizations don't have the resources to go to court, that is why these atheist organizations file lawsuits, no matter how frivilous. The guy gives a couple of examples of lawsuits they got tossed. I am 99% certain it was one of these two days. If you really would like to know, try to get the transcripts from the show.  The group is Alliance Defending Freedom, based in Scottsdale, AZ	0
1) a) There is no valid evidence of this. Sorry, countries that have banned guns aren't safer. b)Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime Why do you ignore that they have low levels of crime? People die every day, the cause doesn't matter, or at least in this situation you haven't shown it matters. 2) We shouldn't be allowed to defend ourselves from the government because they are so advanced we don't stand a chance? Really? That's your argument? We don't need guns because the government WILL wipe us out. Great job. 3) Do you know what the word amendment means? An amendment is still part of the thing it amends. If we give up our guns will you give up your 1st amendment rights and STFU?	1. a) Yes there is: Number of murders per 100,000 USA = 6, Switzerland = 2.9 England = 1.5. England is empirically safer, I have a lower chance of getting murdered. <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/oct/13/homicide-rates-country-murder-data'>http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/                                       2009/oct/13/homicide-rates-country-murder-data   b) My point is that it is not that 'the guns are in the hands of the criminals' as there are fewer criminals in Switzerland than either US or UK, the guns are in the hands of ordinary law abiding citizens, but the fact they are out there = crimes of passion = dead pool boys. 2. My point there is that the argument it is a barrier to tyranny does not hold water as your pea shooter doesn't have a chance against an abrams, you can't vote for guns to be used against the government while simultaneously voting for more money to the government so they can arm themselves better. We have a very small armed force who frankly wouldn't have chance of oppressing the will of the people guns or no. 3. Yes an amendment is a part of the thing it is amending, but amendment means - change, ergo it can be changed!!!	0

"Haha you love it on Modern Warfare 3 (the game) that's probably why you would think it's the best firearm overall ever made. In my opinion it most certainly isn't the best in modern warfare (in reality). They were surprisingly cheap to buy which is why they were so often the weapon of choice in guerrilla war. So yeah it could have been and I'm sure would have been the favored firearm for those who used it after its design was perfected in the last years of WWII as it has many advantages such as the simple design, its relatively light weight, most importantly for those who use it is that it as you quite rightly said ""really rugged and tough to break or jam"" which is why it's reliable and very well known up to this day. Oh and... It looks nice with that lovely smooth woodgrain (in my opinion) hehe. However I don't think it's the best overall firearm, maybe on your game it is but 'ever made' I can't agree as there have been many firearms since the Kalashnikov."

"Please don't refer to my opinions as stupid. Insults do nothing to further your argument. I feel like I adequately addressed all the points you were trying to make - which one did I miss, exactly? Advertisements insinuate a lot of things that, plainly presented, people would consider foolish. But when these messages are subliminal, and presented to impressionable minds a hundred times a day, they do have an effect. This effect is observable in many ways, such as the sad prevalence of poor body image and eating disorders in teenagers and young girls ( <a href='http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/anorexia/statistics.htm'>http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/anorexia/statistics.htm  - <a href='http://www.annecollins.com/eating-disorders/statistics.htm'>http://www.annecollins.com/eating-disorders/statistics.htm  ) Where do you think these insecurities come from? Could it possibly be from the constant deluge of super-skinny, Photoshop-gorgeous models and actresses that young girls are exposed to from babyhood? Could it be the literal thousands of beauty products that she is told she needs in order to be beautiful? 'It's just to get the eyes focused on the product: ""Girls? Hot ones? Interesting.""' Thank you, that is the point I am trying to make. Women are not people, to be portrayed in a variety of roles by a variety of people in all shapes and colors. They are flashy tools, nothing but pretty things to get you to look this way. We are just decorations designed to get men to buy 'crap' they don't need.  <a href='http://enlighteneducation.edublogs.org/files/2008/08/sexstereotypesbeauty.pdf'>http://enlighteneducation.edublogs.org/files/2008/08/sexstereotypesbeauty.pdf  If you are truly willing to have a debate about this, as in you are actually open to seeing things from someone else's perspective, take some time to look through that presentation and really think about the way you see women and men in advertising. Who gets to wear clothes more often? Who gets presented as clever, funny, powerful, and who gets presented as vulnerable, submissive, or simply as a prop? Which gender is permitted a wider range of 'looks', from tall to short, scruffy to neat, heavy to thin, geeky to good-looking, and which gender is restricted to the narrow 'look' of tall, shapely, long-legged, and extremely skinny?"	1. Anorexia comes from insecurity of weak people. How pathetic does one have to be to starve themselves just because their are skinner people than them? Don't blame people who just want their shit to be sexy. Sexy is good. 2. Advertisements are all about getting people to focus their attention. What get's guy's attention the most? Hot chicks. To suggest that they're tools just because they get guy's attention is a little low. If anything, this puts men into the position of being easily manipulated.	0

And how attractive the actors are doesn't really matter, how convincing they are and how good the plot is matters way more. But it's their attractiveness that acts as a very effective lure which convinces people, makes it easier to catch them, and then reel them into the plot. The attractiveness is an ""all-in-one-go"" type of thing. They had me very convinced.  So it's their attractiveness that makes the plot for what it really is and thus makes the story better."	0

You just said it's a huge industry. Imagine all of the money lost from not buying these ads, and then all the jobs lost. That's a bigger crime than addicting people.	"Imagine all of the money lost from not buying these ads, and then all the jobs lost. That's a bigger crime than addicting people. I would like some statistics on how much money is lost. Here's some statistics for you: according to the World Health Organization, 5 million people die every year from smoking around the world, or, 6 every second, a staggering number that could increase to more than 8 million by 2030. What you are saying is that the amount of money gained if we don't ban smoking and the tobacco industry is justified by the killing of millions of people???!!! That's not even all of the stats! I seriously believe that the money lost from smoking is a lot greater than the money lost by the tobacco companies if smoking did not exist. 1. Primary smoking and its health side effects. Look up ""side effects of smoking"" and you'll get tons and tons and tons of side effects that could be caused by smoking. According to the CDC, smokers are 23 times more likely than nonsmokers to get cancer. Smokers are 4 times more likely to get coronary heart disease, 2 times more likely to get a stroke and can cause AAA. Smokers are 10 times more likely to die from chronic obstructive lung disease. 2. Secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke affects people who relate and live with smokers, generally of the same family. Almost half of all children regularly breath in secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes 600000 premature deaths per year. 28% of all children deaths are attributable by smoking. Health defects are also shown in children whose mothers were smoking while pregnant. 3. Cost of life and healthcare. Obviously tobacco companies earn a lot of money. But what about all the money that you are not considering, such as the money spent on health care to cure side effects of smoking? Or the money lost from premature deaths and lost years due to smoking? Smokers on average lose 12 years of their lifetime due to the health effects of smoking...that's 12 years that could have been spent working and earning money for your family, or improving society. On a side note, smoking causes low blood circulation so you would feel a lot less pleasure from having sex...I'm sure that will convince just about anyone to stop smoking. All the jobs lost Are you kidding me? what about all the ""jobs lost"" from the 600 thousand children that are killed each year?"	0

Drug use is strictly voluntary especially in the market. Nobody forces anybody to take drugs except individuals. Government only tries to regulate individual freedom and people behavior due to its health affects, but alcohol and cigarettes are legal drugs, what is the difference, which in turn it creates drug cartels, and government protects drug cartels by the illegality of drugs. Thus, it creates a black market. Black markets cause artificially high prices.	Have you ever been with people who were on drugs? I have, for quite some time.

Staying true to the assumed rules of the scenario (these only work when you make assumptions like you know for a fact the trolley will stop if you roll the fat man in front, you know for sure you have time to do it, there's no other way, etc.) So somehow knowing all these things, you need to get rid of the fat man. You know nothing of any of these people, the fat man could by a philanthropist millions depend on the the teens could be hoodlums who will later turn into serial killers. but you only know for certain you are sacrificing one adult who's lived, for five kids who've not yet had the opportunity. The choice is clear, and in a scenario where you have the power to know and achieve all this, I believe the dead kids' blood is as much on your hands as the fat man's would be.

In order for a species to be extinct it must die out from all corners of the world at once. An unlikely scenario for the adaptive and quickly spreading human. In our world today there are more than enough nuclear weapons to wipe out the entire species at once. New technologies could yield easy ways for a very small group of people to endanger the entire population.	Let me get this straight: You would rather live in a world with rampant starvation and death compared to the only potential threat of nuclear weapons. This is the reason to do away with money. Also, how do you think nuclear weapons were invented? Did they fall from the sky dropped off by aliens or were they invented by the use of money converted into capital whether it land, labor and entrepreneurship?	0
"Global warming is due to civilized people releasing green house gasses into the atmosphere as they go about their normal lives. If we reduce the amount of these green house gasses escaping into the atmosphere, we should be able to slow global warming. We can reduce the amount of these green house gasses escaping into the atmosphere by reducing the number of civilized people on the planet.  This solution also has the added bonus of eliminating rush hour traffic. However, an unfortunate side effect will be an increase in the number of stupid people on the planet. If we take them out too, we may be able to find a nice balance.  Since we wont be able to burn the bodies (due to the generation of green house gasses) we will need mass graves. These graves should provide a fertile ground for trees to grow on and help reduce the green house gasses already in the atmosphere.  As we start offing the stupid people, starting with terrorist, the media will lose part of its entertainment value but regain it by switching to a format like ""bad boys"" where they follow Global Warming Relief Units around as they whack stupid people and people who aren't ""green.""

Both sides are wrong, so I just picked one. Germany did not cause it, but they certainly took the lead in it. Austria-Hungary started the war by invading Serbia, and since Germany was allied to A-H, they mobalized. And since Serbia was invaded, Russia mobalized. Then France mobalized in support of Russia. Then Britain got involved after France was attacked.

I think his philosophy is interesting, but his agenda becomes quite clear as he applies it to American society so I'd take it with a grain of salt.	0

I'm sorry, I don't understand why you think a somatic feline cell injected into a dog's egg should grow into an embryo. Or what the Cambrian Explosion has to do with that.	"Because, the egg cell is just a cell, right. Cells are supposed to be defined by their DNA. So if you put cat DNA into a dog egg cell, the cell should grow into a cat. But it doesn't. Which means that animals are defined by more than just DNA. There has to be some other factor involved. Thus, no matter how mutated and random a DNA strand gets, as long as it's a dog, it's offspring will be dogs. Unless that other factor happens to also randomly mutate. But we can't assume that, as we don't know what that 'other factor' is. So, in the Cambrian Explosion, when there's loads of new body shapes (defined by more than just DNA), evolution claims that's caused by random mutation of DNA. But it's not. If it was, our dog-cat thing would grow into a cat. But it doesn't. So a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is not a Cambrian 6-legged sea creature.

Well, as long as the other person isn't over 18, it's legal in every state I believe. So I'm not sure what the problem is. There's nothing illegal about two people both under the age of consent having sex with eachother I dont' think. If they are over the age of consent, and you are under the age of consent, in your State, then you are probably making a mistake of one sort or another anyway. Unless you're a dude underage, then it's more like a score, but the other person could still be arrested. Unless you are both in High School, and one of you happens to be over 18 and you live in a State where age of consent is 18.  One of you could go to jail anyway and be labeled a sex offender for life, which is actually kind of retarded if you are both in High School.	0

Truthfully, I don't think Hillary would win because of the stain of these recent scandals, but its up in the air. The Republicans can field a good group the next round, with Rand Paul and the Latino guy (I forget his name). However, we also might see a surge of Libertarian candidates winning elections, so that might split the Republicans and Democrats and make a tri-party system.  A second civil war, I think, is inevitable and is needed. The main leaders of the breakaway states would be South Carolina (they started it the first time and never forgot it), Texas (for obvious reasons), and Wyoming/Montana. Most of the South and Midwest will follow suit. That would effectively split the nation into a pro-union California/Nevada/Oregon/Washington West and a New England/Ohio River Valley East versus all the other states. It would be a two front war. The thing the breakaway states would have is more supplies in food, manufacturing, and trade. They would have a smaller population, but that population is more heavily armed. The Pro-union would have a numerical superiority, but most of them probably have never touched a rifle, let alone trained with one. They would also have their food supplies cut off from the Midwest, effectively starving them out. Really, the Pro-Union would fall apart due to it being split, starved, and inexperienced.  I don't think it would be just a war of civil liberties, but also state rights. Just without the slaves as an excuse to invade.	"Truthfully, I don't think Hillary would win because of the stain of these recent scandals, but its up in the air.

However, we also might see a surge of Libertarian candidates winning elections, so that might split the Republicans and Democrats and make a tri-party system. Libertarians are only popular when they are complaining. They are great at talking about how everyone else is lazy, or hates America, or is unconstitutional, or whatever the flavor of the week happens to be. Again and again in national elections they garner a whopping 5-12% of the national vote. They can win sometimes locally in rural gerrymandered districts, or even States when they come in as a third party and split up the vote, but not nationally. You can't win nationally unless you stand for something, not just against everything. Waiving the flag and screaming ""constitution"" isn't enough. A second civil war, I think, is inevitable and is needed.  No war is inevitable, and rarely is war needed. A civil war in the richest and most privileged country in the world least of all. The notion is silly at best. South Carolina (they started it the first time and never forgot it), Texas (for obvious reasons), and Wyoming/Montana. Those are four purple states that will be Democratic, not Republican nor Libertarian, within a decade or two. Most of the South and Midwest will follow suit. Not a majority of a single state would support the idea, the percents in the Midwest would be so small as to be laughable. It would be a two front war. The thing the breakaway states would have is more supplies in food, manufacturing, and trade. No they wouldn't. CA is the tenth largest economy in the world by itself and poised to pass Brazil and Italy soon. The people who own the manufacturing and food in the states you mistakenly believe share your odd paranoia about the United States as a country, sell that stuff primarily to the very States you seem to think would suddenly be starving and defenseless. They would not support their self-destruction financially, much less risk the inevitable death or imprisonment such a silly an pointless uprising would lead to. They would have a smaller population, but that population is more heavily armed... Not compared to the United States military, whom would be the ones to squash your band of merry wood-dwellers, if it were not handled by local law enforcement first, which is far more likely. Pretending neither police nor military existed however, we've been through this before and today the population is even more skewed on the side of the north. You mistake most choosing not to have guns for an unwillingness to get and use one should the need arise.  I don't think it would be just a war of civil liberties, but also state rights. Just without the slaves as an excuse to invade. The south started that war, slaves were not ""used and an excuse to invade."" Though that would be a good enough excuse. The core problem with this imaginative and fanciful argument is that, in fact, today states and individuals have no less rights than a decade, or two decades, or five decades ago. In fact, people have more rights."	0
Why would one debate another's religion if it were not having an effect on something outside of that sphere?  Would politics not be the largest sphere it could affect outside of its own?	The idea the a head of state will be elected solely for his religious beliefs and not for his political policies is absolutely ridiculous.	0
OMG?!?! Are you drunk/high?  .	If time isn't a tool invented and created by man to understand the universe, then who or what kept track of time before humans resumed time tracting or is there some giant clock in space that I am unaware. Also, why was the calendar invented by man?	0
No I have not taken anything out of context. You Christians cannot think for yourselves, can you?	I still don't understand what the difference between a Christian and a Messianic Jew is.

Well if you're having sex with new partners every weekend, that's obviously just for the lust. Is that right? I don't think it is. Lust is a horrible thing, and can lead people to do horrible acts, and make bad decisions. Also, there's the chance that you can impregnate multiple people. I'm not saying that these children aren't equally as important as any other child on the planet, but is it really fair for them to be born into the world when there's not the real love between two people? Accidental pregnancy's can lead to skewed lives for children, as the parents might not have the basic relationship beforehand to sustain them. I'm not saying it's the biggest deal ever, but if you think of sex as nothing, then before you know it, we'll be breeding like rabbits.	"How is lust horrible? It's giving into pleasure, and pleasure is a good thing. Also, the when humans were just started that's all we did. Try to produce as much offspring as possible. Because we're animals, and that's what animals do. You're saying what's natural is wrong. Those children are fine. I know many products of ""loveless"" sex, and those people are completely normal and function great. Sex is nothing. It's just sex. It's natural. Everyone does it.  Feelings change that. But sex is just sex."	0
One question..., 4 words.... What about the sun? ; )	You really are an idiot arent you. Yes the sun is responsible for global warming of course it is, without it there would be no warming (and no life for that matter) of that is true but the primary casue of accelerated global warming as supported by the entire worlds scientific community is that the accelerated warming is due primarily to the increased concentration in the earths atmosphere of green house gases (CO2 and CH4) which cause certain wavelengths of light to be diffracted back into the earth when leaving, this is man made global warming and to disagree with the scientific consensus shows just how stupid a person you are me friend.Peace out.	0
Oh, and drinking human blood is a form of cannibalism, it is cannibalism. You are feeding off of your own kind, you are eating your own kind. Doesn't matter if you eat or drink, you consume it either way. If you rendered meat a powder, mixed it with lots of blood and drank it then that would also not be cannibalism?	Your wrong, as I said the dictionary definition defines Cannabilism as eating the flesh of your own kind blood is not flesh, Vampirism is the drinking of blood, when someone has a blood transfusion the blood is injected not drunk and meat rendered into a powder is still meat	0
"A firmament that separated the waters from the waters. As if there was almost like an ocean above and an ocean below. THIS NEVER EXISTED. For obvious reasons. One being that theres no proof a god poofed anything into existence and another that the intense greenhouse effect it caused would burn up all life on the planet.  As for the incest thing it would never stabalize... 2 people literally cannot spawn 7 billion people over ANY length of time. It just doesnt work. As for the flood. It never happened. Where did the water come from? No explaination. How did the saltwater or freshwater animals survive in brackish water? How did the non-sea plants and animals spawn after the flood? Where did the water go? No boat of the size in the book can hold that many animals, their food, feces, ect. Men dont live past 120 max EVER so noah was not 500 freaking years old. And ultimately the sediment layers studied by geologists disproves it entirely not to mention that we have writings from other places in the world at the same time as the flood and they never mention it or died. You can't have evidence for a deity ""poofing"" things into existence. How would you?  Exactly. so how can anyone propogate that they know for a fact that it happened? You are the creation of the deity so how would you even know? Im the creation of my mother and father and i know how it happened and that they both exist. The process was natural. Why should the creation of the universe be any different? Being a creation doesnt mean we CANT know. A pile of dirt may have started out as a bacteria and evolved from there and from that made Adam and Eve I don't know how it happened. Dirt came AFTER bacteria. What is dirt? Decayed plant and animal matter. We cant have plants and animals living and dying so much that it created dirt before we even had bacteria. And bacteria werent even the first creatures. The first protein strain had to exist. We dont know how it happened exactly but from that point we have a really solid recreation of how life evolved from step one. Nowhere does it include or ever need a god or any supernatural force. Im not trying to be mean when i say this but you have no idea how evolution nor abiogenesis works...  I wasn't there. Neither was I but i dont need to be. With science we can discover many things. And with logical thinking we can dismiss certain ideas. Combine the two and we have no need for a god. Hes out of the picture. He didn't make it up really you just failed to think for a few seconds. I dont need to think about it. Its entirely rediculous and ive also heard it tons of times before. Could a god exist? Sure its possible. But everything we know about the world. Every theory and law and finding all of it has natural causes and processes that explain it. Never once have we ever needed supernatural forces to explain something. So why should the beginning of the universe and planet Earth be any different? Occams razor. That says that it is more logical to begin with using the simplest explaination before moving on to more complicated ones. And it is more logical and simple to explain the evolution of our planet and the universe according to natural processes that align with EVERYTHING else we know instead of assuming some supernatural force that goes AGAINST everything we know poofed it into being. Not to mention we have evidence for our explaination and theres zero evidence for a god doing it. You must be a hardcore Atheist. If you wanna call it that. I perfer the term INFORMED atheist. I read and study scientific findings. I research things and read the works of prominent scientists and atheists and even creation scientists. I watch debates between theists and atheists to see whos side is stronger and i listen to people on here and debate with them. And every single time the atheistic side has come out on top. Every single time the creationist claim is destroyed by the REAL science. I wont ever say ""I know for a fact there is no god' that would be a lie. I dont know. but you dont know either. And no priest or pastor or pope does either. And no scientists for that matter. But i will say theres probably no god. I dont think there is one. THat is my opinion formed after years of study and the study i continue to do. Theres a whole world of information out there for you to assess. I suggest you take a look at it and decide for yourself instead of having other people decide for you. Im not making accusations, just observations."	"A firmament that separated the waters from the waters. As if there was almost like an ocean above and an ocean below. THIS NEVER EXISTED.  The firmament is the sky............the sky would split heaven and the waters.......I mean it only takes a few seconds to think of that..... One being that theres no proof a god poofed anything into existence and another that the intense greenhouse effect it caused would burn up all life on the planet. What does the greenhouse affect have to do with anything i said? There has to be a slight greenhouse effect for life to start. Just not as much a Venus. So what does that have to do with anything I said? Also there is no conclusive evidence against and being like God. As for the incest thing it would never stabalize... 2 people literally cannot spawn 7 billion people over ANY length of time. It just doesnt work. Adam and Eve for example may have 7 children. 3 girls 4 boys. Thats three mates. They mate and have three more children each making 9 children. Repeat until you get to 7 billion.  As for the flood. It never happened. Where did the water come from? No explaination. How do you know? Were you there? No. Where did it come from? God maybe? If he exists he can make some more water. That isn't a hard task.  How did the saltwater or freshwater animals survive in brackish water?  There is no need for them to. God said take two of every kind of animal so grab two fish. Why grab all the species if their habitat will change? That is illogical. So grab two fish or primarily any kind (probably closets to him). Two whale would be simple. They dont have to be on the boat. Two ocean fish would be simple. They wouldn't have to either. Hopefully you aren't assuming God meant grab two of every species of animal. That would be crazy. Where did the water go? No boat of the size in the book can hold that many animals, their food, feces, ect. Um yes it could. Like I said grab two of a kind of animal not two of every species. Leave the whales in the water. Throw the feces of the boat like a normal person would do. Food would be easy because there would still be space.  Men dont live past 120 max EVER so noah was not 500 freaking years old.  Dude, stay with the context of the story. I don't care if he was just 20 and died. He lived for a long time. If God exists its all possible. And ultimately the sediment layers studied by geologists disproves it entirely not to mention that we have writings from other places in the world at the same time as the flood and they never mention it or died. I swear other cultures talk about a great flood. Sediment samples? You are dealing with God. Leaving a trace would be against his beliefs. Exactly. so how can anyone propogate that they know for a fact that it happened? It goes both ways. You can't prove of disprove it.  Im the creation of my mother and father and i know how it happened and that they both exist. The process was natural. Why should the creation of the universe be any different? Being a creation doesnt mean we CANT know. You mother and father a probably alive. Were you there to witness the creation of earth? How about your parents? Grandparents? Great grandparents? Ancestors? Nobody saw it. You can never know if it happened or not. Dirt came AFTER bacteria. What is dirt? Decayed plant and animal matter.  I was thinking more along the terms of just earth and maybe some water and with the right chemicals you can form something. Scientists have formed amino acids in a lab without dirt so I would assume it is completely possible. We cant have plants and animals living and dying so much that it created dirt before we even had bacteria. And bacteria werent even the first creatures. The first protein strain had to exist. An amino acid or something. Sure whatever you wanna say. I am sure it touched some dirt and by that I mean earth and water. We dont know how it happened exactly but from that point we have a really solid recreation of how life evolved from step one. Nowhere does it include or ever need a god or any supernatural force. Im not trying to be mean when i say this but you have no idea how evolution nor abiogenesis works... That's true. I don't waste my time on it because I don't like science. If they can't have an exact answer I don't want to hear it. Tell me when they make a legit discovery. Neither was I but i dont need to be. With science we can discover many things. And with logical thinking we can dismiss certain ideas. Combine the two and we have no need for a god. Hes out of the picture. No you just have people thinking logically while God is somewhere far away or something. Whatever religion deems him as. It doesn't delete him. It just ignores him. I dont need to think about it. Its entirely rediculous and ive also heard it tons of times before. Could a god exist? Sure its possible. But everything we know about the world. Every theory and law and finding all of it has natural causes and processes that explain it. Never once have we ever needed supernatural forces to explain something. So why should the beginning of the universe and planet Earth be any different?  Because it is Earth and the Universe. Its so controversial. If you didn't know what a firmament was I highly doubt you actually think these things through.  Occams razor. That says that it is more logical to begin with using the simplest explaination before moving on to more complicated ones. Simple Explaination: God Complicated Explaination: Science So what are you exactly saying? Its more logical to believe in God or something? And it is more logical and simple to explain the evolution of our planet and the universe according to natural processes that align with EVERYTHING else we know instead of assuming some supernatural force that goes AGAINST everything we know poofed it into being. Not to mention we have evidence for our explaination and theres zero evidence for a god doing it. A god could have just spawned the universe and walked away. Then you are just examining what the God did. It doesn't go against anything at all. It just examines the creation of that god. If you wanna call it that. I perfer the term INFORMED atheist. Informed? You didn't know the definiton for firmament so your credibility in my eyes has dropped.  I read and study scientific findings. I research things and read the works of prominent scientists and atheists and even creation scientists. I watch debates between theists and atheists to see whos side is stronger and i listen to people on here and debate with them. And every single time the atheistic side has come out on top. That's because most Christian debaters suck ass. I am sure an Atheist has been defeated above. There are still things science may never answer.  Every single time the creationist claim is destroyed by the REAL science.  Thats cool I guess? I mean I really don't care that much. I don't watch arguments. I do other things.  I wont ever say ""I know for a fact there is no god' that would be a lie. I dont know. but you dont know either. True.  And no priest or pastor or pope does either. And no scientists for that matter.

Puerto Rico has a rich culture and a way of doing things that would not be supported by the citizens of Puerto Rico. Though it would be a great benefit for the people to receive the financial aid that the United States could bring, but Puerto Rico operates at an almost normal state without America’s limited command. The majority of the population would not vote for a Governor that would even consider ruining the culture and heritage of Puerto Rico’s great history, and for most Puerto Ricans the thought of being ran by “Gringos” isn’t a very good idea. In my opinion Puerto Rico staying a commonwealth is perfectly fine as it and the U.S. involvement with Puerto Rico is at its farthest point and Americans should not push for anything more than Puerto Rico as a commonwealth, unless anything gets worse.	Its true that Puerto Rico is rich in culture, but why limit it just to Puerto Rico. As a Puerto Rico native you should want to share your culture with everyone. We share ours with them, so they should share theirs with us.	0
Nothing is something, and being that knowledge can't be determined meaning it is deemed nothing. It is that something that is unknown that makes it an ability to be opinionated. Knowledge does is exist, undefined i know that i know nothing.	I up-voted you because that is a tough act to follow in terms of spouting nonsense. But I'll have a go at saying something just as meaningless... What something is depends on whether or not that something can be determined to have qualities not separate from what is being supposed in the earlier statement which only proves that the probability of any given possibility is affected by neither what it has become or someones opinion about it.	0

"If you would have asked: ""Did the Norwegian ref make a shitty call?"" I would definitely agree with that. But the whole pretext of ""Canadian women robbed"" makes it sound like the ref and bunch of network executives were smoking cigars together and saying ""this is how it's gonna be boys. We like USA and got steer this game in their favor."" And I just don't buy that. Could the outcome been different and those calls weren't made? Absolutely! But does that put the game back in the Canadians favor? I think that's just life. Every sports team has been the beneficiary of a bad call at some point. You learn from it; you move forward."	I get what your saying and tbh i don't buy it either. I do however believe in this particular game my countries team played their hearts out against a team who much outclassed them and it feels like their hard work was all for naught. they won bronze at least (our first ever medal in this event) however i still can't fathom the disappointment this team must feel. We could've played the US a thousand times and this is the one time we would truly outplay them. I just feel robbed and what better way to cope than make a completely biased debate about it.	0

Migrants are good for the country's economy and culture, hell, Australia was built on the backs of the first migrants who were sent over from the UK. Why should Australia accept far fewer migrants?	A migrant is someone that chooses to go to another country or place. They make there own dicision, they are not forced. (definition from a dictionary.) The first fleet was about convicts going some place else because there wasn't any enough room in the prisons. A large majority were convicts who were forced. Then there were soldiers and comanders who were forced as well, because the convicts needed to be overseen and then a minimal amount of citizens chose to come to Australia for there own benefits.  A have to repeat that it was a large majority of convicts that came and they were forced.  So are we really built on the backs of migrants???	0
but I'm a libertarian, I want to be the boss of my own money. Then you are not a libertarian, you've just drank their koolaid. Find an issue of freedom, any, where individual clashes with business, and you will find libertarians are suddenly less concerned with individuals and more concerned with business. The fact is we are social and our societies at this time depend on exchange of goods and services through money. The money you have is always controlled by outside forces. The less say society has in that does not result in more say for you, it results in more say for whatever fills that void, in the libertarian world--big business.  The difference between society control and business control is you have a say in one and not in the other. Libertarians support less freedom for everyone ultimately accept the very few richest of the richest who can afford themselves their own police, schooling, roads, etc (we're talking 7 million a month, not 7 thousand), everyone else is at their mercy, what prices they set, how well they decide to check the food they make for disease, what schools they deem should be made affordable for you. This is the ultimate result of libertarianism, which is why it is only attractive to the young and inexperienced and to the older and slightly unhinged.  People who make 2000$ a month can barely survive - sure they have free healthcare and school, but what about food? Food is expensive, and especially where I live. True. Now imagine they don't have healthcare or school as well. That is the result. And the free healthcare and education is not as good as you think - because it is free, there is no competition, and competition is good - when you compete, you try to be better than everyone else, there is no need for that here, because everything is sponsored by the country. etc. Theoretically, but not in practice. Every single country with Universal care pays less for better care. This is a long established fact, and the only thing clouding that debate is the money private care in the U.S. and abroad is able to spend on ad campaigns telling you to say what you just said.  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita'>What countries pay per capita <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems'>What they get for that money More and more people who have the money to do it, choose a private school, because they are much much much better - and MOST of the people can't afford schools like that, because 60-70% of their salary goes to taxes. This is a misconception, a huge one. Private and public schools perform the same when compared across socio-economic class.	You can't state that the public is better before you have experienced it for yourself. I would loooove to go to a private school, and I would afford it if it weren't for the taxes my parents and I pay. The private schools ARE better here, they have checked the grades of students from public and private schools, and the result was that the students who go in a private school are statistically better. People who make 2000$ a month can barely survive - sure they have free healthcare and school, but what about food? Food is expensive, and especially where I live. True. Now imagine they don't have healthcare or school as well. That is the result. No, what I meant is, that they can barely survive, because of the taxes they pay. 2000$ is 1000$ after taxes, and that is a tough budget to live of. Food&house;> Health care & education.	0
I think you're misunderstanding me here. I think the theory of big bang is so beautiful and so interesting to learn about. I actually believe in big bang - but I do believe, that big bang was caused by God. Several atheists have said to me, that I believe in magic - unicorns or Harry Potter. But I'm just trying to make you realize, why I feel the same about your religion. I feel like you believe in magic, when you say there is no God - the same way you feel I believe in magic when I say there IS a God.	No, I'm not misunderstanding you, here. How is it magic to reject magic? That's all atheism is.  Also, what's my religion? I wasn't aware I had one.	0
"yes. there are several reasons they should be, but i'll just make a few points to support my position. my first point is: maybe you believe it's ""immoral"" because of you're religion, but not everybody has the same beliefs as another individual, so it's unfair to try to shove it down anothers throat. and another is: if you think it's ""disguisting"", then don't watch. nobody is forcing you to spend so much time bashing homosexuals. it's a personal decision for them, and you have no right to criticize. they're the one who'll die when it's their time to go,  let them live their life as they want to. it's not like everybody will agree with everything that you do,  so give it a rest. be a bit more mature, and get over the petty gay bashing. honestly, being rude about it won't change it. they're going to make the choice they want anyways, why waste you're own time trying to make them feel bad about it. put yourself in their shoes, would you want somebody punching you in the face, and cutting of your reproductive organ, because they thought that you were wrong for loving the person you love. just grow up, and leave the decision up to the individual who can make their OWN decisions. it's called a PERSONAL life for a reason."	if it is so personal why are they going around waving rainbow flags..... if it is so personal why can I google search it and find it all over the internet. If it is so personal , why are there lawsuits in court everyday of predudice.. the next thing you know we are going to have a holiday for those Gays that were persucuted. Come on give me a break.

the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter This part of your definition is useless for our purposes because it begs the question: it's implicit in this view that there's a difference between life and non-life, but that's the exact thing we are trying to figure out. As for your more specific characterisations: Capacity for growth Everything has this capacity. An iron atom grows when it chemically reacts with oxygen. Reproduction There's a large range of chemicals that are self-replicating. In this sense, reproduction is not unique to 'life'. Functional activity A computer program has functional activity as well, but we wouldn't call a computer program alive. continual change Everything changes.	None of the things you describe fit the WHOLE criterion of life. You are merely breaking down the details of the criterion and then applying something that only fits that single detail. Not the WHOLE criterion. <.<	0
If we are all sinners, then we will allway's sin without God(for those who do not accept Jesus). That means it is an infinite crime. However for a finite crime no.	Why are we all sinners? Adam and Eve ate the fruit, we were just born of them, without choosing to be.	0
there are SOME instances wherein those feelings are right, and then we regret it because we did not follow our own intuition. The reverse is true too. There are some instances wherein those feelings are wrong, and then we regret it because we followed our intuition. I'm a prime example of that. I used to be a very devout Christian, but after lots of praying and in-depth studying I discovered that it was false. So, I wasted 25 years of my life going to church, paying tithing, and praying to a god that doesn't even exist.    Yes, not all people could be right, so how are you saying that you are right even with all the facts...considering that people, who usually make errors, gave it to you? My lack of belief in god isn't so much based on facts as it is lack of facts. I've seen no credible evidence or logical arguments that support the belief in a god.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like your saying basing something off of just a feeling is just as credible as basing something off of facts because those facts may be wrong. I seriously doubt you believe that, so I'm probably just misunderstanding you. arent you forcing your beliefs on us that there is all but logic in everything? Is there another method of determining the truth of something that is more effective than using logic?	The reverse is true too.

So, I wasted 25 years of my life going to church, paying tithing, and praying to a god that doesn't even exist. Yeah, id say that what you said is somehow true. And somehow I understand your point because you used to be a Christian, and im quite baffled that you gave up on your religion so easily. But, somehow, Im guessing, you are regretting that you've helped other people because of the payment that you have given. The donations help other people, and I dont think that you have wasted your time as a Christian. Even if Im already going away from the topic, I just want to say that.. nothing was wasted because you were able to help other people. Even without religion, you could still do. My lack of belief in god isn't so much based on facts as it is lack of facts. I've seen no credible evidence or logical arguments that support the belief in a god.

I seriously doubt you believe that, so I'm probably just misunderstanding you. Yes, there is not enough evidence as to how to prove that there is a God.. Maybe you'd say that people who have religion are illogical, but then, you cant attest to them because they are just defending their beliefs no matter how illogical it was. The next thing and statement you said, about the correct me if im wrong thing, I didt understand it much. So please be kind to explain what you were saying, so that it could clear my mind. Is there another method of determining the truth of something that is more effective than using logic? Hmm. Using facts. Well, Im the one who is disputing what I have said in my earlier debates. Thanks to that. But, i just want to say that even if Im a little groggy right now, and I have no idea what I am saying, i want to thank you for being nice on your debates.	0
giving someone life is already an act of bravery. so, the way of giving birth is an own decision of each women. It has been proved by science that a person can bear 45 Del (units of pain) of pain, but during the birth the pain of women can reach up to 57 Del. It is the same as a pain when 20 bones of person are broken at the same time. how can a women be calm before giving birth, knowing this thing? one more argument against the anesthesia: modern technology has discovered the wonderful type of anesthesia called epidural anesthesia. it is most popular method of pain relief during labor. it blocs the pain in the lower part of the body. women continues to be conscious. using it, women have more positive birth experience. more than 50% of women use this type of giving birth in hospitals. it is not risk for human organism. and relief from it is much easier and quicker than it would be in the case of general anesthesia.	Millions of women gave birth to a child and not only one without any anesthesia at all and they all got through it and no one died from this pain. This pain could be withstand and women have already proved this. Women should not be afraid of childbirth in advance and they should calm themselves with the fact that after they will receive the best gift of their life - their babies.	0

The fact that several people have said false while zero have said true (yet, give it time and some right-winger will come by and say weed is stealin' our jorbs) combined with a complete lack of statistics that support your argument in the original post makes me think that perhaps you're just bigoted against the drug, like many Americans (which is, don't tell anyone, the real reason why marijuana is still illegal).	"Don't be ridiculous. I love marijuana. But it doesn't cloud my mind to not see some truth to what is being said.  Excerpts from the original essay (published in ""Under the Influence: The Disinformation Guide to the War on Drugs""):  According to federal drug surveys, about 11 million Americans smoke marijuana at least once a month...Out of these people, NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, had a little more than 10,000 members in late 2003. The Marijuana Policy Project had around 13,500. The Drug Policy Alliance had 10,500....In contrast, the National Rifle Association has 4 million members. The average stoner might turn out for festival-style protests like the Bostom Freedom Rally and the Seattle Hempfest, which draw tens of thousands of people every year, but strictly political rallies---that is, ones where you're there to make a point and can't smoke--are lucky to get 100. Compare this to the 'beer parades' of 1932, the anti-Prohibition rallies that drew 15,000 people in Detroit and over 100,000 in New York. They were not about getting drunk. They were relatively sober, if festive affairs where people held up signs that read 'We Want Beer and We Will Pay the Tax,' and charts explained how a tax on alcohol could help get the country out of the Depression.

So if we become the machines than it'll count?  I suppose. But the machinery itself wouldn't evolve. If a woman with a hip replacement has a child, the child isn't born with a hip replacement. However, I suppose we could become hybrid beings.  But how far does it go? Can we keep our humanity if we're ten percent machinery? Twenty? Thirty? Well, depends on what definition you're using. If we take it in a strictly biological way, then 0% is your answer. But if we take a more philosophical approach, you could have up to 99%, if you wished. As long as one is capable of all the things a non-hybrid could do, they are still human.	Do we have to define humans strictly as a carbon based life-form though with certain attributed abilities? Let's say that we skip the machine debate for a minute, and go with a regular born human. Right now, we can choose the gender of a baby before he/she is born. But in the future, we would have likely progressed to the point of choosing facial features, physical aptitude, cognitive ability, etc.  What if we engineered a child to be more than human... a living hero perhaps with Superman like strength and advanced abilities. We could make special things like a high IQ or photographic memory common, and then it would be a regular part of society. Could we attribute that to the evolution of humans or a new form of being? Will we lose our humanity if we play at being God and control our own evolutionary process? What are the repercussions for society?	0

"No offense taken, or intended, I'm not here to find people I agree on everything with :)  I want to go through each point, I'll number the points highlighted in your reply in order: 1. Okay, so then I'm still not sure which definition of religion you are referring to. It seems you mean that a person who may put trust in another, in this case science, is not much different than a religious person's trust in say a Rabbi. Like perhaps I put faith in Hawkings' ideas. I don't want to make that assumption yet. I would say of that, that I only have as much faith as scientific method has proved, and am flexible more so than a religious person would be, when shown different proof. But I'm curious what you mean by this, could you define what you mean by ""practicing religions"" and how that mirrors an atheist? 2. This may be the same as 1. but what then would an atheistic definition of religion be? 3. An agnostic believes proof of a deity is impossible, or does not exist, either way they are not committed to the idea that there simply is not a god. An atheist is committed to the idea that there are no deities, so one cannot be both. If an atheist says ""I don't think there is a god, but there could be"" then they're actually agnostic. 4. I don't think this is nonsense at all. First of all, in spite of this debate, I still have no idea what you really think. In the same sense, no one can know what anyone else thinks. It may very well be that you do not differ as much from other atheists as you think. That is the point. No one can know what anyone believes really. 5. Point taken 6. Same as 4 7. But the difference is proof. Science has theories, and then the theories are either proved or not. There is no attempt to prove anything in religion. I think that would make the belief systems very dissimilar. With science, if a theory is proved wrong, then people walk away from that theory.  That theory was leading people in the wrong direction. How is a religious person ever to know if their theory is leading them in the wrong direction? The difference is, a theist doesn't ask. When they do, they usually end up agnostic or atheist. 8 and 9. Okay. 10. I'm curious how you separate theism from religion. Are you saying one can be religious without being a theist? It seems to be coming back to this point but from different directions, I think this may be the center of our debate.  Okay, I'm going to have to abandon the number system here: """"Now, does that not sound like an atheist? Sure but not necessarily someone opposed to all forms of theism Where is the god I worship? I detect an integral element of theistic worship in the following: I'm open to only what science says and your concept of sound science is infallible? You have more in common with ""religious"" people than you think - methinks What ""answers"" am I appealing to a higher power for? If you believe that two heads are better than one then you have access to a ""higher power"" that has nothing to do with theism. Yet, according to the author of the first paragraph, I'm a liar or don't understand religion. I am convinced it is the latter the author of that quote is them self a bit confused by the entire thing. not as confused as y....LOL Maybe they are still struggling with some indoctrination who isn't?"""" Basically this entire exchange stems from a misunderstanding of each other's positions, and serves little to further this debate, so let me paraphrase what is in my mind during this and hopefully it can be pointed toward a more beneficial direction: It's my belief whether correct or not, that a theist puts their faith in something that has no proof. This may be compared to some degree to a scientific theory in that proof is still missing. The difference I think though is in the pursuit of that proof. You are correct that I am willing to put my faith in a theory that seems to make sense, and in the same way, a god could make sense to another. But if a theory is put forth tomorrow that there was no big bang, but a new mathematic proof supports a constant state that simply expands and detracts the Universe in some way over time; okay then perhaps my ""faith"" will change. I would not continue to believe in a Big Bang in spite of mounting scientific proof. A theist has no tool to pursue the truth in any manner like this though. A theist isn't looking for proof, I believe they are looking for a nice story.  Maybe that is harsh. But while I can see how at face value belief in a theory can look a lot like a belief in a religion, the underlying method for coming about this I think makes them very different. """"maybe they're one of those undercover theists trying to ""just get atheists to ask the question.""  could you please explain that?"""" It is one of the New Born text book tactics. They have a bunch of them, not too important for this debate though. """"Whatever the the situation, it is clear they have spent little time considering the concept that other people do not necessarily think of things in the same light as they do. As evidenced by the first sentence after the debate hook line ""I am atheist and find that I differ with most other atheists on this subject"""""" Point taken. The reply isn't directly related to my point, as the point wasn't for the subject in general, but the lack of evidence of what others really believe. But it's a dead end anyway, so there's no point in pursuing it. """"I find the assumption that I, an atheist, have not already asked these questions thoroughly of myself before deciding on my own personal philosophy, a bit insulting. Is your personal philosophy decided? Have you made up your mind like worshipers do or are you open to change your mind based on evidence?"""" I am more than open to changing my mind based on evidence. I do not believe a theist is, this is where the problem lies I believe. This should not be taken that I am open to theism, as the proof is in on that subject I believe, which would separate myself from an agnostic. I think that is the proper definition of atheist, and I think that is the majority view of atheists. I'm not 100% sure how you believe an atheist should approach the entire thing other than this, and still call them self an atheist."	"It seems you mean that a person who may put trust in another, in this case science, is not much different than a religious person's trust in say a Rabbi. What I am talking about is ""excessive trust"" or worship if you will. There is no telling how catastrophic the consequences may become. I am inclined to believe that the tendency to worship (the behavior I associate with theism) is the main problem. Holding any ""entity"" or ""group"" ""literary collection"" in too high a regard is basically the same thing IMO as being theist. I would say of that, that I only have as much faith as scientific method has proved Most atheists I have met wouldn't touch the word ""faith"" with a ten foot pole. You recognize (I think) faith as a practice which is not intrinsically bad but one that demands caution, curiosity and critical thinking. This may be the same as 1. but what then would an atheistic definition of religion be? Religion is our ideological and traditional heritage. We identify ourselves religiously by our affinity for or rejection of specific expressions of it. Religion to me represents a person's or group's peculiar brand of intolerance, what we pay attention to, promote, struggle against, what we ignore, and alliances we form related to our personal (consciously chosen or passively accepted) value system. An agnostic believes proof of a deity is impossible, or does not exist, either way they are not committed to the idea that there simply is not a god. An atheist is committed to the idea that there are no deities, so one cannot be both. If an atheist says ""I don't think there is a god, but there could be"" then they're actually agnostic. Though I consider myself both, I like to make a distinction between atheists and anti-theists. Someone who is without a belief is not necessarily rejecting said belief. I think it is possible and logically consistent (since that's how I see myself) to be atheist anti-theist and agnostic. Being agnostic I recognize the futility of arguing for or against the existence of deities (people define and imagine them in such diverse ways). As an anti-theist I work to make the practice of worship lose popularity. ""An imaginary problem is a real problem"" ~atypican But the difference is proof. Science has theories, and then the theories are either proved or not. There is no attempt to prove anything in religion. I think that would make the belief systems very dissimilar. With science, if a theory is proved wrong, then people walk away from that theory. When we discuss proof, we are talking about what is sufficient to convince. Religious and scientific beliefs rely on repetition as the primary means to do that convincing. What is the difference between a belief and a theory? Both are subject to change based on new information. Red flags go up for me when people start talking in terms of certainty. It smacks of theism That theory was leading people in the wrong direction. How is a religious person ever to know if their theory is leading them in the wrong direction? It's is our religiously developed values that define what a good direction and a bad direction is. It is our religion that determines what questions we deem most important to ask. The scientific method is just that, a method. The method cannot provide us with a reason to study test and produce records. 'm curious how you separate theism from religion. Are you saying one can be religious without being a theist? Yes I am. I hope I have successfully shared my perspective. If I have failed to address a point you brought up please make me aware and I will make effort to do so respectfully."	0

I understand the argument for a gold standard, I think that it won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now through. I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking, which is one of our main issues and has more to do with inflation than anything. But that is another debate.  Lets return to the original idea that if everyone started using gold for currency, its value would decrease. At face value, yes you would expect its value to actually increase under such a situation. And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on. Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc. The point I merely wish to make is that there are multiple processes which go on, some which raise the value due to increase demand, and others which are often less in magnitude and take longer to have effect, which lower the value due to increase in demand.	"""I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking""  The gold standard, by definition, would nullify fractional reserve because; what precisely is the reserve? What is it that the banks are putting on reservation? They are reserving gold/silver and the federal notes we call cash, are IOUs for that gold. Since 1971, Nixon completely separated all convertibility between gold and the dollar and the value of the dollar falls to it's intrinsic value; currently less than 4 cents. Adding the electronic dollar, the dollar can devalue to 0.17 cents, to 0.011 cents; read, each dollar is mere fractions of a penny. Put it another way, the gold standard is a special case of frational reserve whereby the reserve requirement is 100%, not 10% [US]."	0

youre lying. the debt was 10.5 trillion in 2008 but bush already passed 2 trillion in bail outs, so thats 12.5 trillion he was also in the middle of 2 uneinnable wars which costs 100s of billions and also lost the propoganda war which emboldened our enemies and mulitplied the number of terrorists out to get us...this was also down the the lies about weapons of mass destruction obama has taken unemployment down from 10.5% to 7.9% hes created over 5 million private jobs and cut over 500,000 public jobs. he has overseen the american stock market double in value in his 4 years too...hes withdrawn from these 2 wars, he been 100% more effective with foreign policy than bush, hes got the terrorist leaders, got bin laden and ghadaffi, taken out the troops, spending 2 trillion less than republicans on military waste too and hes also more respected worldwide and brought us in america more respect hes saved the auto motor industry, gm and chrysler are back at the very top of the world...saving a million jobs ....hes reinvested in infrastructure and roads and education, science and technology, stem cell research, clean energy, and healthcare for 50 million poorest....these will ALL benefit our great nation again....he is NOT a socialist or a communist, nor is he a slave to corporate greed as hes fined the corporate crooks 100s of millions including british petroleum $25 billion in one go he is a man who is looking at the long term well being of america....retail sales are up, hes created the majority of new jobs in the small to medium businesses, where hes reduced taxes and regulations...but tighten regulations for the biggest corporattions who have gotten away with murder for years. the us debt to gdp has fallen a huge amount from 3.59 to 3.26 this means our economy is way stronger and more ready to pay off debts too..america has grown at 2.5% a year on average thats way more than every european nation  hes a very smart decent intelligent man who has brought balance and long term investment back into america.....the american dream is not that corporate greed can own 99% of our wealth and get bailed out by government if they fail....the american dream is that anyone can make it to the top through sheer talent, honesty, hard work and dedication...long may that dream prosper!	"Wow the delusion is strong with this one. At the beginning of Obamas first turm in office unemployment was at 6.5% at the height of his first turm it was at 9.5% and its still above that now. the national debt I higher now than when bush left office not lower. Gas prices have only gone up. No to mention he is anti business hence hi ""you didn't build that line"" and pro union he's even admitted that. And no he has not withdrawn from any war we are still fighting in Afghanistan if you haven't noticed and the forces he ""withdrew"" from Iraq they just went to Afghanistan so we are still paying just as much but for only one war now well I guess that's some how different. Obamas greatest strength is that he's a masterful politician his greatest weakness is that he's a horrible president."	0

Is it a shroud? Yes, it seems to have wrapped up a badly beaten man. Is it from Turin? Well, its kept there, but it was discovered in 1355 in France by a soldier of fortune who never explained how he got it or even where he got it from.  So the real question is - does it belong to Jesus? I think highly unlikely. Some suggest that the person wrapped in the shroud was actually still alive, maybe unconscious or in a deep coma. Carbon dating puts it at the 1250 - 1375 a.d. although the researchers say they could have tested where it was repaired in the middle ages.	They found a coating on the shroud that messed up the Carbon Dating and then redid the dating some other way and found that it was actually from the time of Jesus	0

Each year approximately millions of innocent animals die in lethal dose tests. There is nothing else in the world that is quite as useless, harmful and misleading as animal experimentation. This is why animal rights activists all over the world should start declining medicines that have been tested on animals.Animals not only react differently than humans to different drugs, vaccines, and experiments, they also react differently from one another. Ignoring this difference has been and continues to be very costly to human health.Clearly, if we are going to make medical progress, a new approach is needed. Human medicine can no longer be based on veterinary medicine. It is fraudulent and dangerous to apply data from one species to another. There are endless examples of the differences between humans and non-human animals.	"While I would agree entirely that the conduct of the experiments can be unnecessarily cruel (and therefore in need of strict regulation), I dispute your claim that ""It is fraudulent and dangerous to apply data from one species to another"". Homologous skeletal structures, genetic similarities, similar brain compositions and other factors mean this is simply not the case. Of course history tells us that some drugs tested to be safe on animals are harmful to humans, and some illnesses in humans (especially psychological illnesses) are unique to our species alone - however in both instances these are the minority of cases. I am certainly not arguing that vivisection should be the only process by which we develop and test drugs - I am strongly in favour of computer modeling and Corrositex (synthetic skin) - however these alternatives must be used in conjunction with animal testing not instead of. Vivisection has brought us many valuable advances in medicine, (heart bypass surgery, for example) and continues to work on cures for cancers and AIDS. Computer models are great, but they do not allow for unknown variables - vivisection can identify these unknown variables. I look forward to a day when we no longer need animal testing, but I'm afraid that day has not yet come. Animal testing is, at the moment at least, still necessary.  <a href='http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/05_02/mouse_053102.shtml'>http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/05_02/mouse_053102.shtml  <a href='http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genetics/neurobiol.html'>http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genetics/neurobiol.html "	0

If you are telling the truth, then what you do is very respectable.  But you admit to finding yourself in unsafe situations as a direct result of your actions. It is very conceivable that interfering with a crime in progress could be dangerous or fatal. It should be legally acceptable, if perhaps not morally so, for a person to decide not to endanger their own safety.	As I stated earlier the world is what we make it to be. I don't want a world that is full of criminals. There is only one way to obtain this objective and that is to actively help to catch them.  If it wasn't illegal to steal, do you think the majority of the population wouldn't steal? If something is deemed legal like stealing, then one could never own anything. It would be stolen as soon as you bought it. The only way to deter theft is by letting everyone know you will accept it.	0

In any regards, your argument is also invalid. Even if the war was taking place because of other discrepancies. What's to say they attacking military don't know your language? What's to say the war isn't a civil war? These are factors that'd be eliminated by having war codes, in lieu of actual words.	0
"Hey lame fuck, look at the title of this debate Sorry, I thought this was the other debate. Earlier you said ""I don't believe Gods are anything at all"". Which position reflects your true opinion? If you believe in God, you believe he is a higher power. I am taking the tone you set.  Can you hear my tone? I was crazy enough to infer that from when you said """"I don't believe Gods are anything at all"" I am not an atheist. Every definition is made up dipshit. Some are better than others, and just because I'm comfortable challenging a predominate trend and you aren't is no reason to get all stupid about it. I am a vegetarian. Not the kind you think. I am a vegetarian who eats meat. I don't like the original definition of a vegetarian. I think vegetarians can be lots of things. While sitting here eating a steak and calling my self a vegetarian, I am not comfortably challenging a predominate trend. I am simply stupid."	"I am a vegetarian. Not the kind you think.

Absolutely!!! Homework may be the only connection between the classroom and the home. Students don't usually care a lot about home study or revision of what they take in the classroom; therefore Homework is an effective tool to get them to reinforce what they learn and real learning does not happen if reinforcement does not take place.	yes it reinforce what we learnt in school but it should be limited . Some teachers don’t know that hw can destroy students patient .After getting a lot of hw students try to finish all of it and keep doing it until they discover that it will never finish .so after that they will always ignore the hw .	0
I think it may collide negatively with social issues.  There are Young Carers all across the country and every day they have to deal with the hardhsips of caring for other people. They are rarely given a break and work long hours to look after their parents/grandparents/someone else.  This means that their work and the time they can put into it is limited and their overall social capacity is pretty much destroyed. There are charities to help with this, but they cannot solve everything.  To make this mandatory you would be intentionally condemning people to a lack of social and mental capacity as they have to work and care for other people. It is not a good idea.	Mandatory is not how I defined this topic, I interpreted it as should meaning to indicate duty. Children have a duty to look after their elderly parents. Like I said in my earlier arguments everyone's situation is different and I don't want to create rules that govern society. I just feel that looking after, as in regularly visiting or taking them to the doctor or out for a meal, is an admirable feat that could be considered a duty of children to care for their parents. Warranted it is not for everyone.	0
France ended that. Absolute Monarchs are superior to a dictator. If you were to compare Hitler or Stalin to King Louis XIV you would see that they both lacked that second world fear.	Proving, king Louis reign was flawed. Once the king or Prince dies, so does the legend. With a dictator the person in charge decided what everything stands for and if he's killed, anyone can pick up his legend making it the new dictatorship under the same rule. Funny story, a lot of modern nazi's believe they will find a <a href='http://www.ewtn.com/library/NEWAGE/HITLEROC.TXT'>reincarnated hitler to pick up where he left off.	0
PCP should never be legalized because the government must protect those who are unwilling and irresponsible of making their own decisions. The Government must have a paternalistic role in controlling the availability of drugs and those innocent victims killed every year from drug use.  Without the role of government, availability of drugs would become wild, and everyone would become high, and it would be the end of civilization and the economy. Our economy would solely be based on drugs and addiction. There would be no need for anything else.	I said to play Devil's advocate.	0
You are really proper brainwashed mob ...a sheep that refuse to think! Staying hidden in your little word of magic and talking animals.. I hope that you don't have kids.	"I know how to think as well as you do and I wasn't brainwashed into believing or forced to believe what I believe today. It was a choice and a decision that I had made out of free choice, just like you choose not to believe it.  There is no magic and talking animals.(except that one story where God opened the mouth of a donkey)  Oh I well have kids and you won't stop me from having them and how dare you say that I hope you don't have kids. What is up with you thinking that way that I shouldn't have kids? That is plain stupid and foolishness and foolish person would say that kind of things.  Plus why all of sudden are you attacking me? You don't respect my beliefs is that it? I am fine believing what you believe I don't start attacking you or other people now do I?

"So it just exploits people? Same argument for porn. It exploits people. But people like it. The women get the attention and the money while the guy gets a temporary high. These advertisements are meant as ""rewards"". They're meant to get their attention... that's the sole purpose of marketing. To grab the consumer's attention. When selling a product that men tend to like, what grabs their attention? Hot chicks. This is just normal. You can't really change the male mind. It's part of natural selection. They constantly want to fuck women; so hot women get their attention. What gets a woman's attention in an ad?"	Advertisements differ from pornography in that they exploit fears and insecurities. Porn fills a demand of society and in my opinion, is fairly straightforward. People watch porn by choice and know exactly what they are getting; sexual gratification. People are bombarded by advertisements involuntarily, and ads are aimed at convincing people to spend more, sometimes without them totally realizing it.  When I said rewards, I didn't mean that the advertisement itself is a reward. I meant that the advertisement implies that if a man buys a particular product (beer, candy, deodorant, cars, whatever) he will 'win' a women, or women, not because she likes him but because she is so mindlessly attracted to the product he's bought. You don't win people, you win objects. There are plenty of companies of all types that are very successful without engaging in sexist advertising, so obviously that is not the only way to do things.  I think it is unethical to use attractive or barely dressed women to get a man's attention in an ad, especially when a) the product has nothing to do with naked women and b) the woman is presented in any of the negative ways previously mentioned. The message to men in these ads is that women will only like them if men spend money on them, and the message to women is that men will only like them if they are impossibly beautiful.  I can't speak for women in general, but what gets my attention in an advertisement is originality, honesty, and humor.	0
"""I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking""  The gold standard, by definition, would nullify fractional reserve because; what precisely is the reserve? What is it that the banks are putting on reservation? They are reserving gold/silver and the federal notes we call cash, are IOUs for that gold. Since 1971, Nixon completely separated all convertibility between gold and the dollar and the value of the dollar falls to it's intrinsic value; currently less than 4 cents. Adding the electronic dollar, the dollar can devalue to 0.17 cents, to 0.011 cents; read, each dollar is mere fractions of a penny. Put it another way, the gold standard is a special case of frational reserve whereby the reserve requirement is 100%, not 10% [US]."	You can loan a gold piece the same as a dollar can't you ?	0

Well according to True Blood, Twilight, and The Vampire Diaries, it wouldn't be so bad, but even with those aside you have to take into consideration naturual selection and things of that sort. If human blood is the only thing that can maintain them then they can't kill all of us. Then again, in the movie Daybreakers they ended up herding us like cattle. Then there is the potential that as with Supernatural, the series, that they can live off of any blood. If that is the case then they will simply follow rules and not hunt humans, with the exception of criminal vampires, but we have criminal humans that hunt humans so that won't be too diffrent. Finally I must say, if vampires existed and they were just regular people living, or not, like us then they'd be at the top of the food chain with humans as virtualy a food sorce to them, and if they chose that we had rights, then they wouldn't imprison us like in Daybreakers but instead they'd end up keeping our population from overflowing. Which I would hope people would see as a good thing.	"(1) True Blood, Twilight, and The Vampire Diaries = not real vampires. (2) Natural selection and ecology would sort things out, but there is no reason it would be sorted in the favour or interest of humans. (3) In most mythologies human blood is necessary for sustaining vampires, however synthetic blood has been introduced as a viable alternative so humans could potentially be quite unnecessary in the broader scheme of things. (4) Even if vampires did not need human blood it does not follow at all that they would ""simply follow rules and not hunt humans"". Why should they follow human rules? Particularly if they are evolutionarily superior there is no reason for them to respect a human species that likely finds and treats them as abhorrent/evil/problematic. Humans likely would not settle for peaceable sharing of their long standing dominance on the food chain either. (5) Being managed like livestock, while likely a solution to human overcrowding, could hardly be considered a non-problematic condition for humanity. And again, there is no reason vampires would choose that we have rights (the mere fact that you imply our rights become their choice indicates the sheer unlikelihood of an evenly balanced power dynamic). In sum, seems like wishful thinking."	0
"Okay, ""war"" I'm using in shorthand of military conflict. But because early into the war there was the Iraq Resolution. The Iraq Resolution gave Bush the right to go ""use force"" on a number of bases.  ""The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States ""as he determines to be necessary and appropriate"" in order to ""defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq."" President doesn't have nearly as much power as you seem to think he does. That seems like a lot of power to me."	The President can invade a Nation, but he can not go to war for this long without Congresses approval. 90 days is the longest a President can sent troops into a Nation without Congress's Approval, we have now been in this war for... what 5 years. Seems to me like you should be planning other people. The President can't really do much at all. He doesn't even get to see most bills until they have been watered down with pork.	0
But that's the thing if their are two party's involved they both should have a say if they can't reach an agreement then take it to court.

You can have no desire to live, but still be afraid to die. And not be afraid because you don't want to die, but because you don't know what being dead is like.  I have no desire to live, but I am afraid of the unknown.	And not be afraid because you don't want to die, but because you don't know what being dead is like. Good point, I don't know anything about death, which is obviously terrifying.  Now this argument can be turned on it's head if we agree that to desire an aspect of something, means that you desire that something to some extent. I may dislike the sourness of apples but I desire the sweetness. The idea is that I may not like apples overall, but I do want that sweetness, so to some degree I desire apples. A person who is afraid of dying because he doesn't know what being dead is like prefers the security of knowing what living is like. So there's an aspect of life that he desires, he desires the certainty associated of living. So if we apply the idea above it's given that since he desires an aspect of life, he desires life to some extent.	0

So Adam and Eve created a microscopic organism (aids virus) out of nothing? Are you sure you want to argue this? No, sin created a degeneration in today's world. You're implying I said something I never said. I never implied Adam and Eve created Aids. Their sin allowed Aids to enter the world. And interesting note is that God is one for monogamy (and no re-marriage after divorce). And Aids wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem if everyone stuck with one sexual partner for life. God's laws were for our own protection (pun only partially intended), and this was long before people even thought of STDs.	No, sin created a degeneration in today's world. You're implying I said something I never said. I never implied Adam and Eve created Aids. Their sin allowed Aids to enter the world Adam and Eve created the Aids virus by sinning.  Jimbo didn't kill Bob, Jimbo's shank allowed Bob to die. This is essentially what you are arguing. Placing blame on the verb(shank/sin) rather than the noun(Adam/jimbo).    Moving on... How could a virus that did not exist before, come into existence out of thin air? Adam and Eve cannot create life out of thin air. Sin is not a 'thing' it is an action.	0

Atheist: a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings. <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheist'>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheist  Agnostic:1. a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable, or that human knowledge is limited to experience. <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic?s=t'>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic?s=t  Now how can one that denies be open to anything?	There is more than one kind of atheist. I'm not a fan of Richard Dawkins, I actually think he's kind of a prick, but the belief scale he describes helps clarify things. 1 · Strong Theist: I do not question the existence of God, I KNOW he exists. 2 · De-facto Theist: I cannot know for certain but I strongly believe in God and I live my life on the assumption that he is there. 3 · Weak Theist: I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God. 4 · Pure Agnostic: God’s existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable. 5 · Weak Atheist: I do not know whether God exists but I’m inclined to be skeptical. 6 · De-facto Atheist: I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable and I live my life under the assumption that he is not there. 7 · Strong Atheist: I am 100% sure that there is no God. Most of the atheists I've met consider themselves a 5 or 6. The atheists you are referring to are a 7 on that scale. I don't think many atheists would rate themselves a 7, but I'll see if I can find some statistics on that. Even Dawkin's himself said he's only a 6. I agree with you that anyone claiming to be a 7 is not being open minded.	0

"You don't have anymore friends with the Internet than you do in person. An acquaintance is not your friend. Friends are those people that will do almost anything for you without anything in return. People have many acquaintances, but few friends. Out of boredom one can find an interest on the Internet. ""Misery loves company."" Watch the news tonight and in a week it will be the same. Let me highlight it for you. 50/50 chance of rain, somebody shot, a Hollywood couple split up, some sports team won, and another video was a success on Utube.  As far as information goes, I'd suggest doing research into reliability. Check out Wikiapedia's disclaimer, for example. About the junk in the library, one should read it before dismissing it.  Casual research means reading someones opinion. I'm so glad that modern technology lets you sit on your ass and watch movies whenever you want. All hail the Internet.  About product reviews, who ever spends the most money gets the best reviews. See definition of capitalism. Porn, trying a real person and you'll lose more than just your virginity."	"Dispute my terminology if you would; it makes no substantive difference to my point. A large number of my acquaintances I met and interact with on the internet. In some ways you can say that everything you do, other than life-sustaining functions (eating, sleeping, etc) and what enables you to perform them (working so you have money to buy food, etc), is done out of boredom. Why do you go to the movies? Because that's better than sitting there staring at your fingernails. Why do you chat with your friend - er, I mean, your acquaintance? Because that's better than sitting there staring at your fingernails. Why do you go fishing, or hiking, or learn Latin, or travel to Egypt? Because that's better than sitting there staring at your fingernails. Why do you join a Japanese cuisine club online, or join a book review club online, or find other people who play Diplomacy online? Because that's better than sitting there staring at your fingernails. But that's a rather pessimistic way of seeing the world :P If you're not interested in news developments, that's fine. But I am. If you don't care about movies, that's fine. But I do. And if you don't watch porn, that's fine. But I do. For people who do share these interests, the internet makes practising these interests a lot easier. Dismissing the internet because other people use it to practise interests that you don't share in is rather short-sighted. Onto the point about the reliability and usefulness of information on the internet, which I think is your biggest error. Firstly, let me clarify that when I say ""junk in the library"", I'm not dismissing the information you can find in the library. Rather, I'm dismissing the method of information storage and retrieval in physical locations like libraries, which is unnecessarily time-consuming and convoluted compared to information stored on computers. (Of course, that's looking a little into the future - not all paper material has been digitised yet, so there are times when you'll still need to track down physical sources. But archives and libraries around the world are catching onto the ease and accessibility of the internet, and are steadily republishing their material online.) Now, reliability is an issue no matter where you do your research. Published hard-copy books can contain unsubstantiated statements, silly arguments, and crackpot theories too. When you're doing serious research, you need to learn to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information, and blindly drawing that line based on whether your source is published in paper or on the internet is going to get you into trouble in any respectable academic institution. For example, you do know that a very significant number of the academic journals published by universities around the world in the last hundred years or so can be read through online databases? That many collections of primary source materials, previously available only on microfilm to people able to travel halfway across the world to study them, have now been digitised and are available free or via subscription? That new theories and the results of new studies are usually published in journals, which are distributed online, before they are published in hard-copy books? If you're dismissing the internet because ""the information is unreliable"", that means you haven't yet learned how and where to find reliable information online. Most research, casual or serious, involves reading other people's opinions to some extent. When you learn the theory of relativity, you're finding out Einstein's opinion on the way the world works... which he supported and strengthened with the research and theories of other people, of course, making it an opinion worth learning about. Opinions are by no means useless. Product reviews are a subset of ""opinions"" in general, and some are indeed influenced by ulterior motives, as you say. Again, it all comes down to how good you are at finding material on the internet that impart useful and relatively reliable information."	0
That's a completely unfounded statement. Are you sure you just aren't aware of my reasoning? Well with that logic you can say that when someone dies and becomes dust then the dust is a person. Or I could say that this dust is not all that became of the person. I know a number of people who are considered dead who are more inspiring than most who are considered alive. Things can change to such a degree that it isn't what it was original and that is an example. Perhaps from moment to moment such changes occur and it's only through our failure to ascribe significance to these changes that we don't see a need to create a new label for each stage of everything that changes. Another would be if I eat a beef burger and then shit out 4 hours later - believe me when I say it is not a tasty burger anymore It's a chewed up, partially digested, shat out burger,that would be tasty to flies, and some dogs.  in the same way that some dust that used to be a human 3000 years ago is not a person anymore. Every bit of the person remains albeit in changing form, just like your stinky burger shit. 'Current biology'? Well yeah of course. Its called growing. Extra credit points if you correctly guess which usage definition of literal I was thinking of when I chose that word :)	Or I could say that this dust is not all that became of the person. I know a number of people who are considered dead who are more inspiring than most who are considered alive. So to you extending yourself best boundaries is just influencing people after you die?  Perhaps from moment to moment such changes occur and it's only through our failure to ascribe significance to these changes that we don't see a need to create a new label for each stage of everything that changes. What? No. You 'ascribe significance' to the change in being a burger to being shit. We can call it digestion. If something fundamentally changes then it is no longer what it was to begin with.  It's a chewed up, partially digested, shat out burger,that would be tasty to flies, and some dogs You're seriously arguing that my shit is still a burger? Believe in evolution (its sad I even have to ask this but it is necessary on this site :/ )? Is it correct for me to call you a star fish? Do you consider yourself both a starfish and a human? I suppose if a change doesn't negate the original definition I imagine you're also a chimpanzee, bacteria etc etc. Must be confusing for you. Every bit of the person remains albeit in changing form, just like your stinky burger shit. The atoms are the same. It is still a different thing. Graphite and diamond are both made of carbon atoms but they are very different things.

Gravity hasn't been proven, it just is. We have observed it, but not thoroughly explained it. This is the same with emotions. You feel emotions affect you and you watch emotions affect others, they are constantly observed.	"Gravity hasn't been proven, it just is. We have observed it, but not thoroughly explained it. You don't have to thoroughly explain something like Gravity to prove that i's real, there's obviously some type of pull that's keeping us from drifting off the planet(hey look another part of intelligent design). I have not been to the other planets myself, but I am sure that you've heard of each planet having it's own level of gravity. These things are obvious proof of what we interpret to be gravity, so it has been proven. Emotions themselves could still be fake because people may only give the ""emotional"" response, because they think that's how they are suppose to react."	0

that is contrary to the law of supply and demand. If the demand of gold increases, if more and more people value gold, its value will INCREASE. Supply is limited by real human labor involved in digging up and refining the metals.	If you read Adam Smith's wealth of nations, you'll read him talk about how governments manipulate the standards such that the value of a metal coin stays the same even as the content of its valuable metals decrease. As coins become more valuable, the more tempting is this process.	0

Like I have already said, those who are religious have been out-reproducing those who are not religious, like atheists, each and every generation. This means that the future will include many, many believing Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Europe, one of the most non-religious areas on Earth, is already losing population and will continue to do so for decades to come. The future world will have a bit more Muslims than before, but one heck of a lot of third-world Christians are breeding just as fast as them.	Just because theists reproduce does not mean their offspring will also be theists. Sure, parents do generally sway their children's opinions, but access to information about other beliefs is becoming easier to access. So the children can make their own ideas more easily. Who is reproducing more does not prove anything.	0
"You argue that only option 2 can be true. But option 2 is actually option 1.  ""The Universe is commonly defined as the totality of existence,[1][2][3][4] including planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy.[5][6] The broadest definition of universe is that it is simply everything, while a narrower definition is that the universe is limited to what can be observed.[dubious – discuss] Similar terms include the cosmos, the world and nature."" Therefore 'a self existent being' is part of the universe, therefore in a god could not have created the universe as it already existed."	I actually don't agree that there must be a self-existent being, I was just using the Cosmological Argument to show that there are three possible explanations for the universe. You may very well be right. However, this doesn't change the possibility of a the existence of a God. Perhaps the consciousness of God is somehow separate from the Universe? Perhaps they are the same thing? Perhaps there is a God that didn't create the universe, but still exists. My point is merely that while it requires some amount of faith to believe God exists, there is also faith required in being Atheist.	0

Avocado and nuts they are fats, but they contain a lot of protein. You can tell me plants don't have the same proteins as animals - but statistics will still tell you that vegetarians and people who live vegan generally live longer. I have never heard a vegetarian or vegan say, that they feel lazy, sleepy, hungry, tired or anything else after becoming vegetarian/vegan. All the vegetarians/vegans I know or have heard of say they feel energetic, happy and much healthier.

Not really, often the numbers were close or against rome, for example the battle of Pydna. It was rome's more mobile troops that won over the old school greek phalanxes with the slow heavily armoured hoplites.	Mobility in a phalanx is hard to increase. I would not say mobility won out in the over all war. Also attack a country just out of civil wars is very much like kicking a cripple. He may get a lucky shot in a beat you but by all rights you should win if you plan on keeping your self respect. You don't seem to get that wars have little to do with killing. Its more to do with cost. Romans wear cheaper armor. Greek armor is literally made out of the currency. Each Greek soldier represents a massive financial commitment, so if they die it hurts your coffers while quite literally handing your money over to the enemy. What more Greece is a terrible place to grow food. . Raising the same number of troops is not the same as feeding, clothing, and housing them well. With those conditions better satisfied you have a better fighting man. The Romans geographical placement was well suited to providing them with these luxuries and that geographical placement (a large field of fertile land protected on all sides) is a large part of the secret to their success. . The Greeks on the other hand have a terrible land with little space for growing food. Only between mountains could this be done. It was also true that during their civil strife much of this limited fertile land was razed already. It was not a case of superior fighting forces if you look at it from this perspective. Its actually a victory of a stable efficient Roman government that lacked the flawed and weak semi feudal Greek system of government that was littered with administrative weakness and internal strife. Real wars are not so cut and dry as a superior fighting force winning. . To decide who is a better fighter entertainment is a better medium. Even before the Gladiators there was professional dueling in the classical world. The most famous example can be seen in the Aeronautica with the king who duels one man from each ship in a lethal boxing match. Why? Because before banks the main way one moved up the social ladder was buy defeating someone in war, or a duel and taking their stuff. You could make a lot of money very fast. . However when Romans wanted to become great fighters and live in this sort of war economy they studied in Greece, not in Rome. It was generally acknowledged that Greek martial arts where better, and the iconic upward cut to pierce armored foes that many Roman fighters loved is Greek and best shows the influence. The original Greek sword for that is much more logical, a thin fencing weapon rather than a broad Gladius which one might not expect to encourage stabbing maneuvers.	0

I'm talking about Proto Humans. The first Humans that evolved fro. The same Ape that chimps did.	The Earth did not exist 6 billion years ago, let alone anything remotely resembling homo sapiens that could have any bearing whatsoever upon this discussion. A species pre-dating homo-sapiens also would not have evolved concurrently with chimpanzees, so even if that was your intent you were factually incorrect.  Even if you had a functional conception of the evolution of homo sapiens your point would remain invalid and irrelevant, per the argument I presented which you have not refuted. Further, you have dropped your argument about the Holocaust and my counter-argument. You lose that point as well. Effectively, you have no argument. I think we are done here.	0

No, commercials before movies are not justified. I understand commercials on free media like TV, internet, radio, or TV shows on the internet. But, when I pay almost $10 to see a movie, I already paid. I don't need to pay indirectly by watching ads. I think that the movie companies should choose. They could possibly make more money if they lowered the price of movies to a dollar, or even free, and relied solely on ad income. More people would come to watch movies, and ad prices would go up. The movie industry can not survive trying to make money by using techniques of free media and pay media.	First of all the movie companies don't make money off of commercials on films in theaters, those are sold by the theater itself to subsidize their profits. The actual movie companies make enough money from sales of their films to theaters and through DVDs and Blu-ray that they don't need to sell ads. Theaters on the other hand charge first to cover the costs of running the facility itself and of renting the film they show. Concessions are overpriced simply because they can be. The ads help cover additional costs and produce a profit as well. Additionally it gives local businesses another outlet through which they can advertise; in a way these ads are a service to the local economy.  Although the prices of movie theaters drive me nuts I understand that they are not entirely unreasonable. And until the public decides they are the public will not rebel against Hollywood or the theater industry and the ads will remain.	0
I do not agree ,as i think technology is one of the cause of health diseases , may be not the main one,but still it's without a doubt has a great influence on people's health and way of thinking.Of course it cannot be denyed that it's all about a choice and all the people are free to choose whether to do physical exercise or lead a passive way of life,sitting all the time in front of the computers	Regardless, technology does not cause obesity and health problems.

There's a lot of reasons to smoke.  Someone who has an oral fixation, because you have stress, because you're bored, it's something to do when you're waiting for a ride, it's something people do to be social, nicotine is pleasing, and many more reasons.	because you have stress work out, eat healthier, meditate, read a book. These are just a few ideas. There are plenty of other alternatives for you to relieve stress that don't increase your chances of getting lung cancer. because you're bored oh come on... seriously? Do you live all alone in the middle of Antarctica or something? I was under the impression this debate was about cigarettes, smoking cigarettes is not something I would consider entertaining. something to do when you're waiting for a ride I guess that falls along with boredom. Read a book while you wait or listen to music. If you don't have any, then kick a rock or something lol.  it's something people do to be social something about smelly people who continually blow smoke in my face seems to drive my away. nicotine is pleasing So is not having cancer. and many more reasons like if you want all of your clothes to smell like rotten ass smoke, have yellow teeth, waste over a thousand dollars each year on something that is killing you, or if you just want to spend the last few years of your life 90 pounds underweight and hooked up to an oxygen machine 24/7, then yeah...

Freedom OF Religion = Freedom FROM Religion How are they in any way equivalent? One might say that the former infers that latter; however, the former could be interpreted to mean that you must have a religion, with the freedom to choose which religion you have.

...until the contract runs out or they find a loophole.................	Well, the contract isn't as important or needed because in most cases, since most theme parks are privately owned, they have an interest in operating as a theme park because people are willing to pay for entertainment instead of destroying it for office buildings, and the same goes for city, state and national parks. If the company has a vested interest in retaining the park without a contract, then it will stay as a park because there are always people who are willing to pay a fee to go into a park. Therefore, what is the difference between a theme park and leisure park?	0

But if they have a bad influence, then surely that;s a bad thing?  If say the queen of England decides to to something terrible involving the welfare state (even though she cannot that simply) because she has more influence, not only will those affected by the changes suffer, but it will cause leaders world wide to take action. And if there is a dictator like monarch who has more power than a dictator, wouldn't that be a worse thing too?	"The influence for absolute monarchs was fine. For example. King Louis XIV set the ""divine right of kings"" and his influence made religious people fall under his reign and he reign for at least 70+ years. The people never over threw him. The had more power and they had a much more positive connotation than a dictator. If either have a bad influence they both go down. If they have a good influence they remain."	0
The thing about Hydro Electric is that since water is recyclable, a system can be set up with in the generator where it can constantly use the same water in order to produce electricity.	I think you're confused on what hydro-electric power is. Hydro-electric power is when you take a source of moving water (river, waves etc...) and harness that energy in order to create power. The issue with hydro-electric is that it disturbs the environment. Fish, for example cannot swim past damns. It sounds like you're almost thinking of a hydrogen fuel cell where you take the energy produced from the reverse electrolysis of oxygen and hydrogen when they come together to make water.	0

Yes because, if there is no way to observe it, then it doesn't exist. If it does exist then there must be some way to observe it.	"I half agree with you. I agree that if something is said to exist it must have been observed in some way, how else could it have been verified to have existed. But is observation a necessity of existence? I don't think so. To observe something is a subjective reality and has no bearing on the actual objective reality. Items can exist in objective reality without being observed. A new species of fish has just been discovered. Had the schools appeared out of nowhere once observed or had they always been there? If the fisherman who discovered them had looked out the left side of the boat instead of the right and not seen the fish would the fish not exist in objective reality? Well not being able to prove X just means you cannot prove X. To prove X is not real you would need to prove X is not real, but how do you do that with a negative or something that can't be proven? You almost never have to and can be a long discussion...so best to skip it for now. But here is the issue with the above debate: This question is really just shifting the onus. ""IF X can't be proven THEN X are not real"" is the original question.    There is a teapot circling the earth. Prove to me there isn't one. If you cannot prove to me that there isn't a teapot circling the earth does that mean there is one? X(a teapot does not circle the earth)+ ? = Not X.  This is an example of a Negative Proof fallacy or burden of proof fallacy. It really should look like this : X + ? = ?"	0

God was Jesus, according to the Bible, and if God was able to resurrect himself, then it is not a very good death, was it? Physical pain would likely not harm a god very much. Even if it bleeds, it's not actually human so who knows what it's doing. Also, what is a sacrifice? If you sacrifice your life to save someone you love.... JUST KIDDING. And then you come back to life, was that even a sacrifice? If you lost nothing in the end, then what did it matter? If humans are still sinful, if they can still go to hell, if God did not actually die, if Jesus did not actually die, then none of it could have mattered at all.	Physical pain would likely not harm a god very much. Even if it bleeds, it's not actually human so who knows what it's doing. He was in human form, so it would hurt him as much as any human.	0
"Karl Marx =/= communism. Just because Marx mentions something about aligning communism and capitalism doesn't make then complimentary. But even if it did, this would only serve to show the strength of ideology when diversity is cast aside.  If the state values relationships then any relationship, regardless of if it is mono or poly, does not diverge from the state value. They diverse from each other, absolutely, but it means as little as having different professions if the state doesn't care. Besides, not specifying which type of relationships are approved of doesn't strengthen the state, it just doesn't weaken it. ""Tested"" and ""challenged"" are not synonymous. Especially not the way you meant it. This is an expost facto argument as if you really felt they meant the same, you would have only listed one of them.  If one's ideology is challenged by another person's ideology, it doesn't necessarily mean it is wrong, since it hasn't been tested. If it is tested and fails, only then can you be sure it fails."	"Marx and Engels wrote the book. A communist society can not have a capitalist economy, however the ideas of communism and capitalism do not have to be mutually opposed to each other. Communism is a stateless classless society, capitalism is a economic system consisting of capital expansion among other things. capitalism is considered a transitory stage to communism, in that it creates the necessary conditions for communism. All communist may not want capitalism, however many non-Leninists recognize the necessity of capitalism and will support it in various ways because they are communists.  your third sentence is missing a negation. If a idea(s) can be complimentary with a diverse range of other ideas, the idea(s) is more likly to be included within various sets of ideology which may compete, no matter the winner the idea wins. By ideology not casting aside diversity, it increases its strength for it may then be included within many other ideologies.  yep, so diverse values do not necessarily weaken a state. Tested and challenged are synonymous, however I had a hunch you wouldn't think so. If a ideology is tested/challenged, it doesn't necessarily mean it is wrong(nor right, just that it was tested); however if a ideology is ether challenged/tested by either a empirical test or another ideology and passes, it is accepted as permissible by those tests/challenges.  The more diverse a community is, the more ""genes"" it has that may be adaptable to changing conditions; improving the likelihood that the community will survive. Without diversity, what are typically coined as evolutionary processes would result in most things being dead."	0

You can't have freedom of religion without freedom from religion. If one is forced to have a religion but they don't want to be a part of religion is their choice in religion completely free?

The Taliban is a terrorist organization based out of Afghanistan, and the conflict goes way back to the Cold war era. sry, but I was aware of that. and I got confused. but I read somewhere(don't ask me where) that many innocent people were killed in the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan. this lead to them rebelling against the US. I guess that also answers the rest of your argument.	I read somewhere(don't ask me where) that many innocent people were killed in the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Possible, but It wasn't American forces that did this unless it happened after 9/11. We were not in Afghanistan until after that time. The Taliban supported Al Qaeda, and were harboring Bin Laden after the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, this was also before 9/11 happened.  So the Taliban were supporting Al Qaeda lead bombings against the United States before we ever entered Afghanistan, despite the fact that we helped them fight the Russians.	0

"I do not believe in friendship between boy and girl, because it is something else, however it is not friendship. As everybody I have own experience about it.

So I have many good familiar among girls, but you call them ""friends"". In my situations I attract them, they attract me, but the end is one if you are not a sweet couple, you will not communicate with them as with friends among your gender.

"How true this is. Religion doesn't have to be based upon God, it can be based upon a god. Albert Einstein once was asked what his religion was and his answer is as follows; ""My work is my religion, I work religiously."" Whatever is the center of your life is your religion. One's god can be almost anything. For some that god is alcohol, gambling, drugs, work, sex, computer games, etc. If you worship it, it is your god."	"People who claim to have no religion are liars or don't understand what religion is. While I see in one of your replies you decided to take one of the definitions of religious and define that one point: #4 A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. I think you know (at least I hope you do) that words can come to mean multiple things that are loosely related, or not related at all. Since atheists seem to be the subject you are discussing, the proper definition of religion for this debate is: Noun (n) religion, faith, religious belief (a strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control human destiny) ""he lost his faith but not his morality"" (n) religion, faith, organized religion (an institution to express belief in a divine power) ""he was raised in the Baptist religion""; ""a member of his own faith contradicted him"" I think it could easily be said that one is both an atheist, and at the same time may or may not do something ""religiously"". I religiously brush my death twice a day. I don't believe that my toothbrush is my creator. Hence, me atheist, me do things ""religiously"" in spite of this. I assure you the vast vast majority of atheists understand what it means to be atheist very well. I mean, you say you are an atheist. Let me ask you, do you at least try your hardest to breathe when you need oxygen no matter what? Well, that would mean you breathe ""religiously"" Hence by your own definition you are not an atheist at all. ... well hopefully you see your error."	0
Are you silly? Are you really worrying about an animal that has only been around for 10,000 years or so? Some people are ignorant here. The earth is 4.5 billion years old as I've said. We can't hurt this earth. We can shoot every nuclear bomb off and try to kill this planet. That would only HELP THIS PLANET. It would kill all the humans...hence...the Earth would repairs itself over the next 100,000 years or so...no problem!!!!! Just a problem for humans...be more clear on your arguement next time. Of course it's a problem to humans...if you like humans.	yes im worried about an animal who is being affected by global warming in a very bad way	0

Geared towards guys based on statistics that show that the majority of GUYS play video games. Yes. Does that mean that girls cant play them? No, and certainly there are things put into games that may be even more appealing to girls. There is also a whole other side to the video game industry that is specifically for girls. There are guys games, and there are girls games.  But MLP is a single show geared directly at little girls. If you wanna watch it and fap off to it go for it, but A) Dont whine and moan and act surprised when every other guy calls homo on you and B) dont boast it to the world like it's something to be proud of. It isnt. You're socially awkward, probably gay, and a potential child molester.	"If girls can do things that are geared to guys, thanks to progression, then why can't guy do things that are geared towards girls? Your logic is poor. Yes girls CAN play those types of video games, so guys CAN watch things like MLP. And it's not their problem that there are narrow-minded people like you, that is YOUR problem. You should let people do as they please. I know countless of guys who enjoy MLP, and the fact that they watch the show has nothing to do with their sexual preference, and out of all the guys that I know that watch MLP only one is interested in other guys.  The real problem here is that you're using the words like ""homo"" as an insult. That's small minded in itself."	0

I agree that it's not an argument against the existence of God by every definition that religious people have come up with (it'd be an extraordinary argument if it managed to cover such a wide base). But it is an argument against a God who is defined as an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being. Since this is a definition that a significant number of religious people accept, it's a genuine anti-God argument. It's just not anti-every-concept-of-God.	It's against God in the eyes of many religious people. Unfortunately, this can not be said for what God is thought to be by the non-religious or just other types of religious people.	0

Despite the gender-stereotyped portrayals prior to the 21st century, Western musophobia has always been experienced by individuals of both sexes."" -- The Wiki. ART?

""Muscle magazines"" are, by definition, looking at ""muscles"" -- and they are for MEN, not women, who want to look at muscles. Nor in general do they parcel up the body except in specific contexts like ""20 days to better abs: Before/After."" They do not put the male ass in a bikini to sell sunglasses or cheeseburgers. The issue with clothing, like that of imagery, is not one of personal choice but of pervasive stereotyping. Who says women get ""less sexy"" as they age whereas men become ""distinguished""? Why are grey hair, wrinkles, liver spots and saggy skin deemed acceptable in one sex but not the other? And 6, no, I was actually thinking of Guess Jeans, but thanks for adding two MORE examples that support my point.  Now if you'd care to provide ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER to support yours . . . ?"	"1. Emotional Instability is THE OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF EMOTIONS. That's what EXTROVERTS are... which I explained. Please read my entire argument next time. 2. That is not evidence against... that just shows the stereotypes. It doesn't say that men and women share it equally, just that both have been known to experience it. 3. Ask photographers why they have women do what they do in pictures, not me. 4. I've never seen an ass to sell sunglasses. I've seen a face... never an ass. The only time I've ever seen just an ass in an ad is maybe for underwear... there's an obvious reason why. Now, if you're referring to the very fact that maybe women wear revealing clothing in beer commercials... that's their entire body and they create a persona of men wanting women. Big deal. 5. Explain more on clothing. 6. I guess you don't see the ""just for men"" commercials (when it comes to gray hair)... and as I said before, cougars and MIFLs are highly popular and they are older women that younger guys find sexy. No one finds liver spots or wrinkles sexy on anyone. And in my personal opinion, women aren't as sexy when they get older... it's part of evolution, if anything. The point of sexual attraction in the natural world is to increase reproduction. As women get older, they are less likely to reproduce, which is why they become less sexually appealing to men. Men, on the other hand, do not lose their sperm count when getting older, so sex for them is still useful in the natural world. I recommend books on Evolutionary Psychology for more in depth analysis on sexual appeal. They're quite insightful. 7. Guess Jeans? So YOU had one example (trying to somehow apply it to the rest of the world) and my examples were showing how it's a failed concept. The dead women was created by a gay guy and a lesbian and the abercrombie and finch ad was considered unacceptable and they had to take it down."	0

Yes, ads are not the only problem, but that is also not the argument here. Every form of media that constantly and strictly relegates women to a submissive, inferior role is the problem. Advertising is one of those forms of media. It further reinforces these stereotypes, and inundates daily life with them. Just because the harmful effects of ads are already in place doesn't mean there is no point in trying to make people see them for what they are. That is the only way to really change things. I am not advocating censorship by any means, because that would be simply covering up a symptom of a disease. I believe that if women were truly equal we would see a dramatic drop in these ads, or perhaps a disappearance altogether. I'm not arguing its effectiveness, but I believe if people all saw how insidiously wrong and disturbing many of these ads are, they would find another way to go about things. Racist caricatures and a far more obvious brand of sexism were once common and accepted in media, but as the general mindset made a shift, they disappeared and most people today would find these old portrayals appalling.  Which non-sexist society are you referring to? Parts of the world where you do not see these advertisements are often plagued by a different incarnation of sexism. In many parts of the Middle East, women are invisible. They are hidden rather than broadly exhibited because they are the private possession of their husband, for his eyes only, something he can do whatever he wants with. In America, a woman's body and personal life is constantly on display for public consumption. The anti-abortion effort, the countless weight-loss pills, various forms of hair removal, anti-aging solutions, and plastic surgery are just a few of the ways that women are made to feel bad about the way they look, or people in a position of power are trying to remove control from them. <a href='http://www.cosmopolitan.com/'>http://www.cosmopolitan.com/ That's just the front page for the magazine Cosmo. Look at the kind of articles that a popular publication aims at women.  How Many Men Have Seen Megan Fox Naked? (Because this is not her personal business, this information is public property) The Best Age-Defying Products Out There (Because women should desperately try to look 25 years old for as long as they can) How to Save Your Ass with Self-Defense (An example of victim blaming in crimes against women.)  Beauty News: Guys Are Attracted to Girls Who Wear Blush (Because women should endeavor to physically attract as many men as possible.) Quiz: Are You too Picky (Because Cosmo knows how women should act better than they do.) PS: I can't believe you said babbys.	"""Which non-sexist society are you referring to?""  I'm referring to a hypothetical society. I think that if sexism was non existent, people would still use sex to sell products or entice viewers. I'm saying that without the sexism already there, these uses of sex would not promote sexism since they would be viewed differently. That magazine exists in the form it does right now because that is what a large number of women want to read. If women weren't interested in those topics that exact magazine would not exist. If that magazine re-enforces sexist ideas then the women reading it are the ones that are doing the victimizing, not the magazine."	0

Because being pulled towards a center pulls matter near the thing being pulled with it. What? Could you clarify, please? They aren't. If you observe our solar system, the planets have a distribution of heaviest elements (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) to lightest (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). Actually, they are. Most of the mass of the solar system (98%) is in the sun, which is made of mostly hydrogen and helium. The planets are drops in buckets compared to the sun. So why did all the light elements clump together in the middle to form the sun while the heavy elements stayed on the outside (orbiting the sun)? That's what happened. Remember that we are also dealing with orbits caused by gravity which allows for planets to keep from falling into the sun. If the planets are in stable orbits (they are), than the dust that made them had to also be in stable orbits (as orbit doesn't rely on mass). Which means that in our stellar dust cloud with the makings of our sun in the center, the dust 'orbiting' would fly off into interstellar space because the sun wasn't massive enough to keep them in orbit. And before that, the dust would have to be swirling at fairly specific velocities with enough matter not swirling to be able to get pulled in to make the sun.  You're forgetting Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus. Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus aren't made from hydrogen and helium like the Sun and Saturn are. They're heavier elements, like methane, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. You really need to qualify this. I did. Writings systems are simplified (from pictographs to sound-symbols), and words are simplified (from fully-conjugated verbs with implied nouns to non-conjugated verbs. I think you want to say that our language has become more casual, without emphasis on social tiers. Sure, it's grown more 'casual', but also more simple. Especially Ebonics and like dialects.	What? Could you clarify, please? A gravity well does not merely move particles towards the center of gravity, those particles have their own gravity well which draws other particles inward towards them, and repeat this to infinity. Actually, they are. Most of the mass of the solar system (98%) is in the sun, which is made of mostly hydrogen and helium. The planets are drops in buckets compared to the sun. So why did all the light elements clump together in the middle to form the sun while the heavy elements stayed on the outside (orbiting the sun)? If I understand your question, hydrogen gas and helium are light elements and would be drawn together. The mass of iron, nickle, and other heavy elements would draw their own matter towards them. These heavier elements are much less common, like you said drops in a bucket. They wouldn't form as big a mass as the sun, but be drawn towards it. I imagine that at some point they formed orbits. Cosmology and astronomy are not my specialties but from what I understand of physics and what I have read it would probably be along these lines. However orbital mechanics is where I find myself really leaving my expertise comfort zone. If the planets are in stable orbits (they are), than the dust that made them had to also be in stable orbits (as orbit doesn't rely on mass). Which means that in our stellar dust cloud with the makings of our sun in the center, the dust 'orbiting' would fly off into interstellar space because the sun wasn't massive enough to keep them in orbit. And before that, the dust would have to be swirling at fairly specific velocities with enough matter not swirling to be able to get pulled in to make the sun.  I have to imagine that the sheer mass of hydrogen and helium would form a body with enough gravity to draw in those particles even slowly. I'm a little out of my element in imagining the formation of orbits however, because this isn't my specialty. Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus aren't made from hydrogen and helium like the Sun and Saturn are. They're heavier elements, like methane, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. Yes, but these elements are lighter than iron, nickle, silicon, etc. I did. Writings systems are simplified (from pictographs to sound-symbols), and words are simplified (from fully-conjugated verbs with implied nouns to non-conjugated verbs. That's right, but we have also gained increasing complexity in the number of words, and dialects within a body of language. Sure, it's grown more 'casual', but also more simple. Especially Ebonics and like dialects. I don't know if I would call them simple. There are divergences in dialects within those dialects, and new vocabulary and rules form each decade. Some of them borrow from other languages, adding grammatical complexity.	0
If you are a student in high school then you shouldn't have a job anyway. Having a job is kind of like an extracurricular activity; If you can't keep up good grades while working then you shouldn't work.	What is homework? Homework is a task given to students by teachers to be completed outside of class. Everyone in life goes to school to learn. After each class students are given homework on the topic done in school. Homework which is usually done at home has to be handed in to the teacher, this is the due date. School which takes up half of the day and lessons which take up another three hours, give students less time to finish homework. This homework ,might take a long period of time to be completed leads to late night sleep and unfinished homework for due date. This can also lead students to fall asleep in class. Homework take away most of our leisure time and recreational activities. Students with useful talent can be wasted because of no time to practice and enjoy doing thing that you want to do.There is no achievement with finished homework. Most of the homework given in schools now need the use for the internet some students might not have the resources to go online or an inequitable situation in which they don't have finance to do all of that will be behind in class. The main thing about homework is that is gives students pressure and stress.	0
Capitalism is the only economic system in the history of mankind that can solve poverty; however, government intervention is the reason for poverty in capitalist economies. Therefore, the division between rich and poor is really an byproduct of brackets in government taxation.	I see.... exploitation of the workforce and natural resources, competition over demand and excessive consumerism promoted through advertising are all solutions to poverty. And the welfare state, a free education and health care, subsidies to small businesses and social housing are all conducive to poverty. Thanks for clearing that up.	0
Answer my question. Don't try to avoid it. Are skin cells capable of developing into a human being? Are skin cells made up of a different human DNA and blood type? Skin cells are from the body of the person while the cells of the embryo are the growing human body of another human being. But gaining a heartbeat makes you an alive human? right? And thank you, the fetus has a beating heart which makes it a human organism that is alive. What are you even talking about. Firstly life has to do with the chemical properties of a living being and the cellular reactions that takes place within that organism. Are you getting the term life we used to describe our daily routine or are you describing the scientific term of life? Live refers to whether the fetus is alive or dead. Both of these terms are proved by the fetus because it has a beating heart which means that is it alive and it has chemical and molecular processes ongoing with cellular reaction which makes it an organism with life. Another explanation of the term life also refers to the presence of living organisms which is why when scientists or astronauts go to other planets they say there is no life? Why? Because there are no signs of living organisms.  So then if it is a living human then does that not makes it like a person who is unconscious and has lose their personhood?  Again a person whose brain is developed but loses consciousness has lose their personhood. Rather than helping them, should we eliminate their existence then? Why is it that you do not know the difference between actual tissues and the growing body of the unborn. That picture you showed me possessed the growing body of an unborn along with a pair of eyes, feet and hands. Why do you not double check it? But the point is they are from the human race? right? Why then when the dead body of a person is stolen, criminal charges have to instituted against the accused? Because the body is a human too and it is not alive. Why is this? Because they are from the human race which gives them rights like any other living human. If it is does not matter then you are disrespecting life of a human in general. The life of the unborn which makes it alive and in which both me and you have so what makes it different? Because it is not self aware and independent? Come on, open your eyes because anybody regardless if you are already born can lose your self awareness or independence but they still have a human life? Right? So why then do they describe a person in that stage as being in the baby stage. The only difference there is that one has not been born as yet but one has already been. But they are both humans? Right? They both posses human life and both does not have personhood. Right? You seem to be failing to understand the concepts of science. A skeleton will have no life in it. Why? Because the DNA is not alive and neither is there any cells or blood alive and this is a different case with the unborn. And a steel skeleton is not the product of human reproduction either. And lastly you would sew those parts together but the formation of the unborn is formed from a natural, living and completely technical scientific process in which all the elements of science and biology are brought together to create a living being from the human race. And finally, your blood type and DNA will not go with the skeleton neither will the blood cells survive outside a living human body so what are you trying to prove?	Answer my question. Don't try to avoid it. Are skin cells capable of developing into a human being? Yes. Are skin cells made up of a different human DNA and blood type? Skin cells are from the body of the person while the cells of the embryo are the growing human body of another human being. Doesn't matter. Ever heard of asexual reproduction? But gaining a heartbeat makes you an alive human? right? And thank you, the fetus has a beating heart which makes it a human organism that is alive. No, a heartbeat is irrelevant to being alive. Flatworms have no heart, for example. Further, kidneys are alive when being transported to donor programs. The issue is personhood. A foetus is not a person. So then if it is a living human then does that not makes it like a person who is unconscious and has lose their personhood?  Not at all. An unconscious person was awarded personhood by being born. A foetus is unborn and has not gained this privilege. Why is it that you do not know the difference between actual tissues and the growing body of the unborn. There is no meaningful difference. A foetus is like a braindead person. Why do you not double check it? But the point is they are from the human race? right? Why then when the dead body of a person is stolen, criminal charges have to instituted against the accused? Because the body is a human too and it is not alive. Why is this? Because they are from the human race which gives them rights like any other living human. Having eyes, ears, etc. doesn't make you a person. Being born does. A dead person was born and for practical reasons retains this so as to prevent looting and graverobbing. If it is does not matter then you are disrespecting life of a human in general. The life of the unborn which makes it alive and in which both me and you have so what makes it different?  It isn't a person so I don't care if it is disrespected. When it is born it is a person, then I care. Why do you care? A foetus may as well be meat, it has no sense of feeling or self. Because it is not self aware and independent? Come on, open your eyes because anybody regardless if you are already born can lose your self awareness or independence but they still have a human life? Right? If they are born, yes. So why then do they describe a person in that stage as being in the baby stage. The only difference there is that one has not been born as yet but one has already been. But they are both humans? Right? They both posses human life and both does not have personhood. Right? Birth is a distinction that is important. It lets us grant personhood to the people who need it, and allows us to give women the option to exercise responsible childbirth. And lastly you would sew those parts together but the formation of the unborn is formed from a natural, living and completely technical scientific process in which all the elements of science and biology are brought together to create a living being from the human race.  Not important here. Both my Frankenstein monster and a foetus have the same quality of mental ability - none. They are but meat, basically. And finally, your blood type and DNA will not go with the skeleton neither will the blood cells survive outside a living human body so what are you trying to prove? I'm making the point that your attachment to foetuses' rights is sentimental and not based on anything of substance.	0

Pretty much everywhere, cell phones are banned because most people say it's distracting. Teachers don't want kids texting in class when they're trying to teach them important things. But the truth about more modern phones is they can be a great learning tool. Students can use calculators (most likely not during math), stopwatches, timers, educational apps, the internet, and more with their mobile phones nowadays. School filters can connect with the wifi and be used to filter specific things that need to be filtered. Also, cell phones should also be used for safety. The employees at a school say you don't need to use your phone to contact people but what if something happens like the school phone line goes dead? Also, if you need a phone number the school doesn't have, it will most likely be under your contacts list. And if students might need to contact a student in another class for something important, they can always contact them. And if a student is sick, they can Facetime or Skype another student during class to watch the lesson and not miss anything important.	It IS distracting. A great learning tool? Sure, it could be. But let me ask you something. Schools are full of immature children. Out of the millions of kids out there, how many do you think would choose to use their phone for school stuff over playing or texting? Yes the school can filter their internet, but what about others? And with a wireless card, they don't even need to connect to a router. My school personally gives out 'student laptops' With the settings restricted, and nothing is able to change without the admin. If done correctly, the student would be forced to do school-related work. If they need anything other than that they'd need permission from a admin. You can't restrict someone enough just by edditing the settings on a wifi. You could restrict the settings on a phone too, but I bet the students would want to do some of those non-school related things at home. Bah.	0
"How do you determine what ""seems right"" other than evidence or proof ?"	Evidence is not proof, so that would be one way to believe in something without proof.

"""Is there a universally accepted standard which isn't completely arbitrary by which we can define an act as ethical?"" No there isn't, hence why we're debating on the matter.

If people were arguing in the form of: There is no absolute answer, but I think blah blah blah. Then I wouldn't dispute them. But we have some people making absolute conclusions, which I see as false.	0

The difference is that something can exist without living. For it to be living it must have life force. A stone does not have life force. Something that is living is also existing, but not everything that exist is living. That's the difference.  Everything exist, but not everything lives.	If you attempt to point out what this 'life force' is you will see that all your attempts are fruitless. Life is litterally nothing but a hugely complicated chemical system. This view is directly entailed by the second law of thermodynamics, and it explains why there's no fundamental gap between life and non-life.  We can see that the term life only causes confusion: We could ask if bacteria are alive, and most would agree that they are. But are viruses alive? This question should be straight forward to answer, but for some reason biologists tend to disagree. They are more simple than bacteria, and those we agree are alive, but viruses seem more, well, non-living. Then there's viroids, which are smaller than viruses, and arguably more simple. Do they have 'life force' or are they just a set of complicated chemicals interacting with other complicated chemical systems? What about a free floating string of RNA which just so happens to interact with a human cell? Nobody would call such a string alive. There is no objective criteria which seperates life from non-life. The term 'life' causes nothing but confusion. Are bacteria alive? As far as an objective inquiry goes, they, just like viruses, are nothing than a set of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. They are just more complicated. Any in-depth analysis will show that bacteria are as non-living as free floating RNA, viruses or anything like it; it's nothing but thermodynamics. But if bacteria aren't alive then what exactly does it mean to be alive? I am linking you a rather interesting article which in part deals with this issue (it primarily shows how life is an inherent consequence of the second law of thermodynamics) If you read it, you might be convinced that any difference between 'life' and 'non-life' is an arbitrary, mental conception. 'Life' is 'life' because we have given it such a meaning, that's my take on it anyway. <a href='http://www.helsinki.fi/~aannila/arto/whylife.pdf'>http://www.helsinki.fi/~aannila/arto/whylife.pdf 	0

They just do whatever and think Jesus is okay with it. So they call themselves Christians. That is why it is a growing trend. Almost 96% of the youth leave the faith so the numbers are growing. According to a poll Atheists are the most mistrusted minority in the United States! Mistrusted? May I see this poll that claims they are mistrusted? Because us Christians are frowned upon greatly. I think all you want is for Atheists to be in the minority for the sake of a Christian majority so you can be content. I don't even see why you would claim or think that. Atheism doesn't affect my lifestyle. It doesn't change anything for me. Some of my close friends are Atheists. They don't care and I don't mind. It isn't a big deal. I will be content with whatever people choose."	0

Although there was machines the workers were mostly peasants and they did not know how to use the machines and the products were mostly useless.

We should not have to do homework the whole point of the 8 freaking hours we go to school is to learn there. so when we get done sitting in a classroom for that long we just wanna go home and relax and i personally have a job that i go to as soon as i get out of school i work until 9 or 9 30 and i know i dont want to go home and do homework i want to sleep!!!

I watched a lot of TV when I was younger. I turned out just fine. I had a TV in my room, and was not really supervised with what I watched. Yet I was never poorly influenced or learned any bad behaviors from it. If anything I learned from the stupidity I saw. And besides, there is a lot you can learn on TV. As long as the kid is still getting some exercise and is overall healthy and doing good in school, then let them watch TV.	TV causes ADD and will make people fat, tired, bored and over all boring...

I should have been more clear; I've seen only New/Old Testement books printed, but I've never seen a Christian church use exclusively one or the other. Actually that's basically what I said, but whatever.  Christianity might be based on the word of Christ (personally I think it's an insult to his message and diametrically opposed to everything he stood for, but, again, whatever), but the word of Christ in the NT is baseless and doesn't make a whole lot of sense without the OT. Jesus came to Earth and died for the sins of humanity as detailed in Genesis, for example; without Genesis to set the stage for why he needed to come and die the crucifixion is a pointless gesture. Christianity might not exist without the NT, but the NT couldn't exist without the OT, so in that sense Christianity wouldn't exist without the OT, or, at least, it would make absolutely no sense (more so than it does now, anyways). So Christianity is based (yes, I remembered the word) on both books of the Bible; you can't have one without the other.  And this is all theoretical; in practice the religion of Christianity is clearly based on both books.	If I got you right, then what you mean is, that if genesis didn't exist then the new didn't exist? correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm not standing here telling you, that christians only worship the new testament, that they only read the new, and that they only listen to the new and believe the new. They believe in both, read them both, follow them both. But what MADE christianity is the Gospels of the new testament.	0
"I'm against any standard currency world-wide. Currency should be a gradual creation through market cooperation; not a standardization based on flawed principals that only become harder to fix over time. All ""perfect"" systems are made bottom-up (unless you believe in God... but hey, that's a different topic). So to say that a government entity can decide what form of currency is perfect for civilization is saying that somehow government can control inflation rates and can enforce this standard of currency without wreaking havoc (cause, hey, the Great Depression never happened and we're currently not in ass-raping debt). Now, the Gold standard I will say is superior to paper money or electronic money because it is a mostly limited product. You can not make more gold (so easily), so inflation rates would rarely ever go up. The main problem, however, comes from the problem of standard currency in general. There is no assurance that wealth can accumulate accordingly with the resources that come into play at random times. If a business is able to mine many resources all of a sudden, they are at a far more significant advantage for they have accumulated all the wealth. With currency being the standard, the poor would depend on that paper money instead of proper allocation of those resources. It comes down to a sort of corporatist, crony mentality to have any standard currency for it encourages top-down management. In some ways, it is secure to have factories where labor is paid with arbitrary dollars, but in other ways that is the only way it would be. When you standardize currency, you greatly eliminate the flexibility of wealth. So I'm against any standard currency. But I prefer Gold to dollars for the sake of practicality and lowering Keynes type inflation rates."	I'm starting to like you more and more .	0

And then they die! We live about 80 years on average. The goal of evolution isn't necessarily a long lifespan, but survival of the genes. By constantly propagating, they ensure a bulk of organisms carry their genes. That is why they are superior in this regard. In eighty years they could practically cover the world, and there will just be you.	I hate the language of evolution having a goal, of there being a purpose of reproduction. Evolution is simply the idea that what just so happens to survive, due to being suited to its conditions of living, well does. Along with the acknowledgment that some variations allow for longer and better survival by bettering how suited a animal is to its conditions and that those variations are transferable to offspring. You can watch it in a petri dish by the careful selection of antibiotics and bacteria. Saying evolution has a purpose is like saying gravity has a purpose, gravity is the tendency for matter to attract itself. To say that the goal of matter is to attract itself would be to anthropomorphize matter. yet this language seem common and it distorts the theory.	0

If there were a license to kill, every murderer on the planet would jump for joy, go out, buy a license, and kill everyone. If there was a license to kill, there would be a population of about 5 billion instead of 6. If there were a license to kill, the world would be thrown into turmoil. The murder rate would skyrocket off the charts, we would be in the darkest times of our existence. And it would only be a matter of time before Obama used his executive power to revoke all murder licenses, or there was a protest too large to try and resist.

"Assuming that coins, regardless of content, becomes fiat. What prevents the car price going from 1 coin to 1 trillion coins? (assuming that financing is not available) What happens if in a village, you triple the money supply? The prices of things will rise 3x accordingly through the market as people figure it out through subsequent trades. This is inflation and is a monetary issue. Part of the argument FOR the gold standard is that this currency expansion is NATURALLY LIMITED. It is simply impossible to whim gold into existence as we do with pushing the zero button on the computer. Gold is a much better limiter than electronic bytes. This monetary stability is crucial for the longevity of a country's prosperity. When people work, they produce a certain amount of product or services and they trade that for some money or currency. This currency must be a store of value over long periods of time; purchasing power. If there is 10% annual inflation (currency expansion), that means, I have to work 10% more to buy the same stuff. This means, that instead of a 40 hr work week, I must work 44 hours next year, less I get a 10% raise (which will not happen). This distortion will trickle through the markets until all 10% (or whatever is left) is used up.  Looking at inflation and hyperinflations in yugoslavia, hungary, zimbabwe, weimar, argentina (which is an interesting case) all did this ""remarking"" or ""replacement"" of their currencies and still failed to stop the hyperinflation precisely because they kept adding to the money supply more than the demand for cash. So much so that when you sit down for dinner, your bill would change and at 2 different rates. First the base meal price change, and then the tip charge, calculating when the waitress can get to the bank the next morning. I'm not saying that the gold standard is the only solution, but it is by far the best solution we have on the table. In the study of money, humans have used just about everything, and it failed the test. Once there is currency stability, there is price stability, and people's purchasing power is preserved. I do not believe that sheer human will in fiat currency can limit the monetary supply. Therefore, we need something that is naturally limited; scarce. This is why in microcosm economies, it's always luxury items that are used for indirect exchange."	I understand the argument for a gold standard, I think that it won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now through. I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking, which is one of our main issues and has more to do with inflation than anything. But that is another debate.  Lets return to the original idea that if everyone started using gold for currency, its value would decrease. At face value, yes you would expect its value to actually increase under such a situation. And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on. Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc. The point I merely wish to make is that there are multiple processes which go on, some which raise the value due to increase demand, and others which are often less in magnitude and take longer to have effect, which lower the value due to increase in demand.	0
Liberals are a menace to modern society. They would like to think that they are beneficial to society because they believe more government brings equality, yet it detracts from freedom and liberty.	"So in other words... ""Lock up people who disagree with my political views, in the name of Liberty and Freedom!!!!"" You should make a career out of political philosophy with genius reasoning like that. The government should contract you to edit the Constitution or something.

First Amendment: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof as long as that religion is the same as mine; or abridging the freedom of speech I approve of, or of the press I agree with; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble in causes I share, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances against people I don't like."": Second Amendment: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people I decide to give arms to to to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

NO, absolutely not! It HAS been 200 years. I am not a slave owner, so I owe no one an apology.	You can remember the Titanic sinking.

You say you don't have to pay for slavery, and it's legacy, because you had nothing to do with that . But my grand children who are not even born has to pay for wars when they had nothing to do with your father's wars, and are being charged for it. You dam right I said you have to pay for slavery, and the legacy of slavery, because one dam thing for sure your grand parent's had something to do with the war against black people. Why the hell do we have to help you pay for it, and your think you don't have to pay for slavery, and the legacy therein post slavery. It is no different now, then it was back then, when future generations has to pay for it's monstrous evil past, this is why you too has to pay for your forefather's and your grand parent's past. Paying for slavery is now charged to you, just as the murderous war in Iraq, and Afghanistan has to be paid by my grand children. What did you think that we are so ignorant, and uneducated that we don't know this. never again will I accept any excuse you give that you don't have to pay reparations for slavery it's legacy because you had nothing to do with it, and for what your grand parent's did to mine..

Actually when a baby cries it is not for pointless reasons. It cries because it cannot speak or do anything (change it's own diaper e.t.c) Older people cry more for stupid reasons than babies actually. It is in the babies nature but for us it is not we may not be able to control our emotions all the time. Plus how can a baby cry for pointless reasons when it hardly understands anything in the world apart from 'eat, sleep, poop, burp' you cannot blame a baby for crying then.	Actually when a baby cries it is not for pointless reasons. Then why do babies wake up in the middle of the night and cry? Why do they cry even though they've been fed and their diapers have been changed? Why do they cry even though they have dozens of toys to play with? Why do they cry for these utterly senseless reasons? Once again, at no other stage in human life does a person cry in these situations or with this frequency. They cry in these situations because their undeveloped brains selfishly wish to express without remorse to all other humans around them with how little uncomfortable they are without consideration for anyone else's feeling. Doing such a thing is pointless and needless, but the baby only has an id to psychologically function on. Older people cry more for stupid reasons than babies actually. Really? Do older people cry just because they haven't been fed for an hour? Not at all. Plus how can a baby cry for pointless reasons when it hardly understands anything in the world apart from 'eat, sleep, poop, burp' you cannot blame a baby for crying then. I'm not blaming a baby for anything. I'm just saying it cries for pointless reasons. Even when a baby can communicate (sign language can be taught to a baby) without crying, it will still cry because the baby only cares about how it feels and not about how anyone else feels.	0
Gun control is a good thing, let me just shred all of the gun nuts' arguments: 1) If there is a prohibition on guns / certain kinds of guns only the law abiding will get rid of their guns and the criminals will 'out gun them': a) The presence of lots of guns in a country means everyone has greater access to them, both law abiding and non law abiding, it will take a long time to reduce the amount of guns in circulation in the US to European levels. There would be a period of transition where criminals would be better armed than the law abiding, but long term America would be a much safer place. The US already has gun registration laws, this means that unlicensed guns are constantly being taken out of circulation and criminals need to replenish their stocks. Make that harder for them! You should be aware that the Mexican cartels import their guns from the US, drugs go north, guns go south. If guns were outlawed, where would the criminals get them from? Canada? b) The presence of guns creates criminals! OK if I come home one day and find the poolboy nuts deep in my wife, if I had a gun to hand I'd probably be inclined to shoot them both. If I have to go at them with the bread knife the pool boy has a very good chance of getting away and a murder not being committed.  As evidence see: Switzerland. Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime, but very high levels of gun murder - why? Because Switzerland operates 'universal conscription' meaning every adult male has to do military service and be ready to defend his country at a moments notice (I guess in case the Germans want their gold back...). This means that they all have guns in the home. They don't have a lot of criminals, but still have disproportionately high levels of gun crime, and a lot of dead pool boys. 2) Owning guns is a check on the tyranny, we have the right to defend ourselves against our own government. The US government has over one million (500K regulars) of the best trained, best equipped soldiers in the world, you are a yahoo in a pickup. The US government has the M1A2 Abrams, you have an Armalite AR15. Good luck with that.  And remember, your soldiers are citizens too, what happened in Egypt when Hozni tried to turn the army on the protesters? The army joined them making more protesters. With tanks. Isn't it amazing that those Republican eeijts that are against gun control are also in favour of increasing defense spending? 3) It's in the constitution No it isn't, it's in the second amendment to the constitution. Do you know what the word 'amendment' means?  The constitution is a very fine and visionary document, drafted by some of the finest thinkers of their age... the 18th century. It is not set in stone and over the years the US government has taken a pragmatic approach to changing bits that are no longer relevant, no paper money etc. - currently up to 27 amendments. Nor, even within the 2nd amendment does it state you can bear any arms you like, at the time they'd have meant muskets and rudimentary rifles... personally I don't feel I'll be safe until I have a stash of weaponized anthrax, surely that falls under the second amendment? And finally... Although I live in a country with bizarre notions about not owning guns of any description, if I did live in Texas, I would totally have a gun collection. Guns are cool. But that does not make them a good idea!	is a good thing?....a good thing would be your stupid ass getting killed by a drunk driver in the near future?... .. ... ........	0

Life: the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. It must fit that criterion to be alive.	the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter This part of your definition is useless for our purposes because it begs the question: it's implicit in this view that there's a difference between life and non-life, but that's the exact thing we are trying to figure out.

If you can't get those nutrients through typical foods, then you supplement them. Just because some vegans aren't eating properly, doesn't mean a vegan diet is unhealthy, it just means those vegans weren't eating properly. The same goes for omnivores; If they don't eat a proper diet, they are going to be deficient in things as well. To fix the lack of B12, all a vegan needs to do is take a multi-vitamin or eat foods that have been supplemented with B12 (many foods are, especially vegan ones).  Vegetarians and vegans have lower muscle creatine and carnosine levels. Again, it's all about eating a balanced diet and supplementing anything that you're not getting enough of. The article about lower muscle creatine even said, ""Well-planned, appropriately supplemented vegetarian diets appear to effectively support athletic performance"" It also said, ""plant and animal protein sources appear to provide equivalent support to athletic training and performance."" Grass-fed meat is higher in omega-3’s, CLA, TVA, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and antioxidants. Those articles were comparing grass-fed meat to grain-fed meat. They said nothing at all about a vegan diet.  Saturated fat is not associated with cardiovascular disease. Did someone say it is? My guess is that you are referring to that quote I posted on the ""yes"" side of the debate, and that you mistakenly connected the statement in the first sentence of the quote with the second sentence. I can see how that could be easily confused. It's not saying that saturated fat causes heart disease, it's just saying that vegan diets are low in saturated fat, and also result in less risk of heart disease, but not necessarily because of the low saturated fat."	0

"That's all completely true. But equality is equality. Equality doesn't care about numbers..  Equality can sometimes seem brutal. If you think about it..  For example if I was the head of a company and I was going to hire 10 people and the 10 best most qualified people for the job were asian women then I would hire 10 asian women. Why shouldn't I? If I thought they were the most skilled and qualified? With total equality I wouldn't have anything to prove. I wouldn't be required to show diversity.  It's not a pro asian women thing(or an anti everybody els thing), it's a pro skill and qualification thing.  Let's look at a question asked by the debate creator: ""wouldn't the the black community throw a goddam fit having the NAACP and Al Sharpton all over the news trying to ban the site.""  -That's a little extreme isn't it. But people on the other side would be angry there's no denying that. I don't know if they would say ""you can't do that"" (we're not necessarily talking about rights or laws) but they would be angry or annoyed at the very least. So with total equality is there any validity in their aggravation?  This poses three interesting questions; Do we really want equality? Do we really have equality? And is the idea of total equality even realistic?  1. I do. But sad to say a lot of people black and white want the opposite.  2.&3;. Hard to say. We've come a long way but it's difficult to achieve because of human nature. Given that I think we're doing a decent job. But we don't have nor will we ever have pure total equality because of people getting fussy over pro white things and vice verse.  (These are honest questions I actually had to think about)  I do agree that for efficiency there would be need for a website like this.  And I don't think the website is racist by the way. EDIT: Ok so I probably shouldn't have actually ""disputed"" your argument because I really didn't dispute anything you said. I kind of got on a tangent about equality. Heck this could have been it's own debate. (;"	Good points. I'm in agreement with most of it. The dating and job comparison though is not quite accurate. Dating you are judging your own attraction as much as what another offers, and this is normal. It should not necessarily be the case for a job. So if I am attracted to brunettes more than blonds and I own a company I would not be in the right to hire brunettes even if there are more qualified blonds based on my attraction. I would have that right in dating though. So wanting to date people of a particular skin color, or being more attracted to a particular shade of flesh is not necessarily racially motivated any more than liking green eyes better than blue would be, in and of itself.  I mean, there could be negative biases associated with attraction on some level, but it is not necessarily the case, and it isn't really fair to assume the worst of another due to who they are physically attracted to.  So the job and the dating comparisons are a little off I think. Otherwise I'm basically in agreement.	0
Well he might not have a reason to lie but he still could be mistaken.	The Book of Mormon says the Book of Mormon is true, and this can be verified when one asks this question of God. If one is sincere in asking, God will manifest that it is true. So, the Book of Mormon is true, and if it is true, its authors and transcribers were not mistaken.	0
I heard that the number one cause of divorce is a bad sex life between the couple. So if you reverse that, a good life sex life is the ultimate key to a successful marriage.

There is a reason why children aren't alllowed to sit in front, you don't think rules like that are there just annoy us do you? What's the reason? The old cars don't have airbag, are probably unsafe on several other areas. But like I said in my argument, if there is none, or if it's turned of - the child has no reason to not sit in the front. So are you against elementary school students sitting at the front? Although when I have children in my car, I want them to sit in the back, because it is a lot more safer to sit there. I know that there are exceptions. How do you know that it is safer at the back? If the car is involved in an accident then the seat may jerk back and crush the child immediately? I actually don't know. I've never done it myself, and to be honest I don't really know if you actually can do it. Then why did you say it could be turned off?	What's the reason? read the rest of my argument. So are you against elementary school students sitting at the front? No, I am against children who are too small to sit in front, sitting in the front. How do you know that it is safer at the back? If the car is involved in an accident then the seat may jerk back and crush the child immediately? If I may quote myself: Although when I have children in my car, I want them to sit in the back, because it is a lot more safer to sit there. I know that there are exceptions. If you read the last 6 words of that little thing, you'd see, that I know there are exceptions. Then why did you say it could be turned off? Because everything that can be turned on, can also be turned of. Almost everything.	0

I see your sentiments are quite quickly changed. Only two days ago were you insisting that animals oughtn't be killed? You, the self-described vegan, now betray your beliefs, saying instead that when it is killed it ought to be done so with respect and without pain. What brought about this change in spirit?	What? When did I ever insist that animals shouldn't be killed? I am vegan because I don't want to be a part of killing animals myself - I don't go around telling everyone else they have to be vegan. If you can bear having the animals blood on your hands, than I am fine with it, I just can't myself. I don't betray any of my beliefs. I have never said ''Don't kill animals'', but I said kill animals with respect.	0
Good points. I'm in agreement with most of it. The dating and job comparison though is not quite accurate. Dating you are judging your own attraction as much as what another offers, and this is normal. It should not necessarily be the case for a job. So if I am attracted to brunettes more than blonds and I own a company I would not be in the right to hire brunettes even if there are more qualified blonds based on my attraction. I would have that right in dating though. So wanting to date people of a particular skin color, or being more attracted to a particular shade of flesh is not necessarily racially motivated any more than liking green eyes better than blue would be, in and of itself.  I mean, there could be negative biases associated with attraction on some level, but it is not necessarily the case, and it isn't really fair to assume the worst of another due to who they are physically attracted to.  So the job and the dating comparisons are a little off I think. Otherwise I'm basically in agreement.	I don't think I said anything about dating. Are you talking about the website? I'm confused.	0
If you would do such a thing, doesn't it make the Philippines less unique than it is? A question in mind as few presume before they even agreed on this: will the Divorce Bill affect any lives of Filipinos? It's just a delusional stuff that the government wants to experiment with to see if we can fit in the modern century, or so I think.	If disallowing divorce is a unique stance, have you thought about why it is so rare? Why have most countries legalised divorce? There are good reasons for it. And I'm sure it would affect citizens' lives - specifically, it'd affect the life of any married person who wants to get out of their marriage, and also their friends and family.	0

"To me the heaven and hell thing makes more sense. The entire rebirth is actually you trying to achieve some kind of ""nirvana"" or something like that but its just nonexistence (release from the suffering of this world). But if the soul lives forever why would it cease to exist? And the entire hell thing I agree is harsh, but for a reason. Hell isn't full of people who don't know about God or things like that, its full of people who have rejected God and continually do so."	"Not all views on rebirth/reincarnation involve the Buddhist Nirvana, a concept which I think you have also misunderstood. An individual does not cease to exist but transcends from the ""I"" into a higher state. So there is a dissolution of the individual, but not a disappearance."	0
If you believe in Global Warming then you are as egotistical as the people who believed that humans were at the center of the universe. You are a sun denier that thinks that humans have a greater effect on our weather than the sun. ;)	Well with the massive amount of CFC being released everyday, it's no wonder that Global Warming can happen. Especially when the whole world is releasing a substance that can thin one of the protective layers of Earth from heat, thus causing global warming!	0
You blame him for causing a war. The fact that you blame him show that you didn't pay attention in your American Government class. He doesn't have the power to declare war. Blaming him for us currently being in a war is like me blaming my cat for world hunger.	Countries outside of the US don't necessarily teach about US government structure. The reason for this is that they're learning about their OWN government structures. If they're studying politics at all, that is. The US went to war. George Bush was the big honcho at the time. That's pretty much the gist of what gets shown overseas. There was the whole WMD stuff, with the only connected name on the news being Bush. Honestly, without looking specifically for the information, how much do you know offhand about the British House of Lords? Kinda possibly knows that system, since he is in the UK. Personally, I know about the House of Representatives in the Australian Parliament.  Just about everywhere in the world, ordinary people who have no knowledge of internal US governmental stuctures think that Bush was the one who caused the war. It may not be the case, but he's the figurehead for the country.	0
"Pyg, the portrayals of women that you refer to don't make you ""love"" them. They just make you want to screw them. In your words: ""dude, check out Megan Fox on the cover of Cosmopolitan, I'd so bang her"". I think you've given us a clear example of what media representations of women do to the male mind, thanks. Are media portrayals of the genders sexist? Oh hells yeah. Especially when it comes to women? Oh hells yeah.  Look at, for example: - The number of women who are screaming about nothing (bleach, rodents, I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter) in advertising as a return to images of women as ""hysterics"" - The number of women in magazines and print ads who are looking at the men in the picture versus looking at the camera - The number of photos of women that show them as body parts (just boobs, just legs, just an ass) instead of as people - The never-ending parade of slutwear worn by every female celebrity from Miley Cyrus to Helen Mirren - The increasing sexualization of female youth and the de-sexualization of female adulthood and aging  - The use of images of violence or degradation of women to sell products Do the models get paid? Sure. Do they control the imagery? No. So whether or not they get paid is rather beside the point. Nobody is arguing that, say, the Olsen twins have personally been victimized by dressing slutty on TV -- but women as a class are routinely degraded by media imagery which presents women as primarily as stereotypes. ""Fortunate and smart,"" Spooner? Because they feed into stereotypes that are ultimately harmful to women? If 99% of the portrayals of the male gender were dudes who looked like Al Bundy scratching his balls and mowing the lawn, would you say those were the ""fortunate and smart"" men because they catered to female needs -- or would the ""fortunate and smart"" men still be guys like Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump, who succeeded at the goals they set for themselves instead of by splashing a photo on the cover of People of themselves looking like a stereotype?"	"On the Al Bundy question, I most certainly would not categorize them as fortunate and smart.  ""Victims"" of media portrayals of women are fortunate because they have killer looks that rake in big bucks, and smart because they use them to that end, preying on society's lust.  Al Bundy is not fortunate in the looks department, and so could not be smart in the same sense either."	0

YEAH.. BUT YOU CANT RESTRICT THEIR INDIVIDUAL BIASES AND CONTENTIONS... IT WOULD ALL BOIL DOWN TO THEIR IDEA THAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED OR THEIR SUGGESTION THAT SHOULD BE UPHELD... MORE TIME WOULD BE SPENT IN DELIBERATION AND ARGUMENT THAN THE ACTUAL PROGRESSIVE PROCESS OF LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER OR SOLUTION...	Individual biases should not affect a properly structured group of individuals. Obviously if there is no structure and the decisions are purely relied on a democratic-voting-like system then biases will dominate the decision making process however this is irrelevant for a structured mass as their ability to provide diverse and unique arguments assist the logical process more effectively than a single individual's wisdom which once again falls to pray of bias.	0
To be fair who said that God had to come from nothing?  I don't know what they believe (maybe they do think that) but it looks like you're making assumptions.

Because they evolved, of course. There are fossils documenting the evolution from one 'type' to another. If it happened once, why isn't it happening now? My great-great grandparents were not reptiles. I'm not arguing that genealogies don't happen. But recorded genealogies only go back so far, and all say we were humans back then. Right now there is no such thing as a reptile-mammal. Or a reptile-bird. They don't exist! Why?	If it happened once, why isn't it happening now? It is happening now. What makes you think it is not? Right now there is no such thing as a reptile-mammal. Or a reptile-bird. They don't exist! Why? As I said, they evolved into the creatures we see today. They are gone, replaced by their extant descendants.	0
"I most certainly do, and if I evolved from a starfish, I think you could quite correctly call me an evolved starfish. My question was whether you would call yourself an 'evolved starfish' but rather whether you would call yourself a 'starfish'. You have changed a hell of a lot since then but you're still a starfish right? Two diamonds are different things, and unless you can prove something doesn't change in any possibly significant way from moment to moment, your logic would have us inventing new terms at a unreasonably fast pace. No two things are the same but they have the fundamental qualities that we use to define them in the same way. The difference between one diamond and another is so close (they both of the same molecular structure, they both shine in the light, they are both very valuable etc.) that we call them the same things. We call a hamburger and shit different things because they are so fundamentally different.  Sorry, no extra credit points for you.

But, it does make them equivalent when calculating GPA. If you take 4 PE classes and get A's, it's a 4.0. If you take Math, English, History, and Biology. You can still only get a 4.0.	Sure. But most schools have weighted GPAs that take that into account. Besides, the main reason GPA is so important is for the purpose of showing colleges yourself as a student to evaluate. Colleges can clearly distinguish between those who pad their GPA and those who care more about learning and challenging themselves.  But I digress, that's probably not even related...	0
Iran wants to strengthen its control in the region, you know the kind of control your government has. I'm not saying their entitled to, but if you asked me whether they should have more of say in the affairs of the region than the US, well i think you can guess my answer. Iran is really fighting against American and Isreali Hegemony and again i dont like to take sides, the thought of a war with Iran upsets me deeply, look ive been there, the people are the friendliest you'll ever meet, they re-define the word hospitality, there not archaic or primitive, in fact their more cultured and well read than most americans (not that thats hard). The thought of your vicious army going in and massacring another million people (or maybe more) in the name of their false ideology sickens me. You americans are able to rationalise all the brutal acts of your government but i think if you were brought face to face with some the results of your countries actions it would hard to dismiss them in the name of freedom fries or whatever other nationalistic propaganda your indoctrinated to beleive.	Oh, I know, I know.... Iran is doing so much good around the world aren't they Gary? You are whacked as hell! Americans give more to charity around the world than any other people...

Yes. Lizzie is a perfect example. She will pardon all actions that would typically be seen as immoral or unwanted by society. Compassion? She spreads that to anyone willing to listen to her. Sympathy? She shows too an excessive amount. She will forgive a murderer in less that 20 minutes after his crime. Lizzie forgave this ChosenOne twice so far. She will do this far to often allowing her to easily be manipulated.	What? I don't do all that do I? The point is. Without all of those things we become like you.

"I don't think so. You see an Atheist, typically, would have no problem being a theist if the deity the would worship could meet their requirements. For example if God said he was not omnibenevolent and makes mistakes like we do we could relate with him more. If he didnt know everything we could relate with him more and be like ""take it easy on God, he didn't know Lucifer would rebel. He didn't know Adam and Eve would sin."" Now a stance on evolution is different. Saying God did it is a possibility, but hard evidence and data trumps ""possibility"".  For example: If you walk on that ice sheet you may fall. Sounds bad right? Try this one: If you walk on that sheet of ice you have an 81% chance of falling through. Changes your decision making doesn't it?  This is how Atheists make their decisions. Its not a lack of imagination, but an open mind. Atheists want a legitimate reason, answer, evidence, etc. No evidence has made proven him to exist, but remains a possibility"	Thank you for not even staying on tooic. I am not talking about that.

At least more important than the convenience of other humans? Would you want your life to be taken away, prevented, whatever, just because it would inconvenience others or because someone decided FOR YOU that it wasn't worthwhile?

"Again with the big assumptions. Sorry, but I downvoted it because I thought it was a lousy argument.

I believe that they should be granted the same rights as men are (which they are), so there's no way I can be a sexist. Those who complain are VERY POSSIBLY an unattractive, envious female. And, Megan Fox is a dumb whore who all guys wanna bang. This is a natural feeling that has been around since the invention of the mammal.

I knew about sex at age 11 -just never watched porn in my life. 11 is a time when hormones are unstable if you introduce porn at such an early stage then they will want more once it is a little more calm and stable then fine- And why show them? And how is there no exploitation? It makes me feel it's so irresistible when it's not once you think about how it is being made. Sometimes you get aroused only by reading.	Yeah, part of the reason it's so enticing is because it's made into such a taboo. If it were introduced and properly explained I doubt it would be so intriguing. Wait, you've never watched porn O_O	0
The current system records student failures and factors them in to their total grades,so students who did poorly at first but improved don't get rewarded for their improvement, even if they worked really hard to improve. Everyone tries so hard to make school a place that 'mimics the real world,' but that just adds on unnecessary stress to people who are still developing and makes teaching and learning that much more inefficient.	The current system records student failures and factors them in to their total grades,so students who did poorly at first but improved don't get rewarded for their improvement, even if they worked really hard to improve. Okay first of all, classes aren't structured in a way that tests students before teaching them the subject... And improvement is very much rewarded! Your grade increases if you do better than you previously have...isn't that fairly obvious? I mean, if you're taking a semester-long class and you start by getting a 70 on the first two tests, but then hard extremely hard and get a 95 on the next four tests, your grade is then an 87, up from the 70 you had earlier. Everyone tries so hard to make school a place that 'mimics the real world,' but that just adds on unnecessary stress to people who are still developing and makes teaching and learning that much more inefficient. I don't think that's true though. Schools can't really appease every student, so a challenging, competitive environment is usually best because it is like the real world. It's not inefficient, especially if tutors and extra instruction is available to those who may be more inept.	0

I imagined America being a huge socialist nation by now. ;) But in all seriousness, I really really hate the idea of his stance on the War on Terror. By pulling out of Iraq, the country has a huge possibility of being overrun by insurgents and terrorists and going back to the way it was in 2001. Bush did a lot to help Iraq and help the world as a consequence of this.	I'll have to disagree with you on this one MK. The Iraqi's need to learn to get their country together and run it the way they wish to. We cannot continue to police them or help them in any way but to aid them in helping themselves. I, for one, do not think of Bush as a savior in all of this. 9-11 + Osama bin Laden do not add up to hanging the Iraqi leader who was our friend for so many years and has not been a friend to bin Laden. I think Bush was dead wrong and I think he knew it.	0

Gun control is a good thing, let me just shred all of the gun nuts' arguments: 1) If there is a prohibition on guns / certain kinds of guns only the law abiding will get rid of their guns and the criminals will 'out gun them': a) The presence of lots of guns in a country means everyone has greater access to them, both law abiding and non law abiding, it will take a long time to reduce the amount of guns in circulation in the US to European levels. There would be a period of transition where criminals would be better armed than the law abiding, but long term America would be a much safer place. The US already has gun registration laws, this means that unlicensed guns are constantly being taken out of circulation and criminals need to replenish their stocks. Make that harder for them! You should be aware that the Mexican cartels import their guns from the US, drugs go north, guns go south. If guns were outlawed, where would the criminals get them from? Canada? b) The presence of guns creates criminals! OK if I come home one day and find the poolboy nuts deep in my wife, if I had a gun to hand I'd probably be inclined to shoot them both. If I have to go at them with the bread knife the pool boy has a very good chance of getting away and a murder not being committed.  As evidence see: Switzerland. Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime, but very high levels of gun murder - why? Because Switzerland operates 'universal conscription' meaning every adult male has to do military service and be ready to defend his country at a moments notice (I guess in case the Germans want their gold back...). This means that they all have guns in the home. They don't have a lot of criminals, but still have disproportionately high levels of gun crime, and a lot of dead pool boys. 2) Owning guns is a check on the tyranny, we have the right to defend ourselves against our own government. The US government has over one million (500K regulars) of the best trained, best equipped soldiers in the world, you are a yahoo in a pickup. The US government has the M1A2 Abrams, you have an Armalite AR15. Good luck with that.  And remember, your soldiers are citizens too, what happened in Egypt when Hozni tried to turn the army on the protesters? The army joined them making more protesters. With tanks. Isn't it amazing that those Republican eeijts that are against gun control are also in favour of increasing defense spending? 3) It's in the constitution No it isn't, it's in the second amendment to the constitution. Do you know what the word 'amendment' means?  The constitution is a very fine and visionary document, drafted by some of the finest thinkers of their age... the 18th century. It is not set in stone and over the years the US government has taken a pragmatic approach to changing bits that are no longer relevant, no paper money etc. - currently up to 27 amendments. Nor, even within the 2nd amendment does it state you can bear any arms you like, at the time they'd have meant muskets and rudimentary rifles... personally I don't feel I'll be safe until I have a stash of weaponized anthrax, surely that falls under the second amendment? And finally... Although I live in a country with bizarre notions about not owning guns of any description, if I did live in Texas, I would totally have a gun collection. Guns are cool. But that does not make them a good idea!	Gun control is the belief that  A. Laws some how magically stop criminals B. a someone who has been robbed,raped,or murderd or all of the above is somehow morally superior to the person that defended themselves. C. Only the police and military have the right to defend themselves D. The constitution can be ignored if it involves guns. The right to be armed is a constitutional right the constitution and the bill of rights do not tell the people what they can do they tell the government what they cannot do. And the second amendment tells the government they cannot pass ANY laws restricting the people's right to keep and bare arms. None of you points are valid because gun control is illegal under the constitution the government dose not have the authority to implement it and if they do (as they have been) they would be in violation of their boundaries and the constitution and we the people would be justified in rebelling against it.	0
I agree 100% with this. This is why I support the death sentance. If you kill someone for no reason and it is 100% that you did it not in defense but to kill someone in the first place, then you should be put to death.	If you kill someone for no reason... then you should be put to death. Right. What if you killed someone, but with a valid reason. Should you still be put to death?	0
If he's as dangerous as you say, might be worth looking into.	There's not much to look into as far as Rorschach is concerned besides the bloody mess he made in the antarctic after Manhattan explod'd him. To be sure, Rorschach does have some neat appeal, but Batman's is a little more long lasting, and there's tons more development for that playboy than Rorschach, since he was a character developed for a single story. Conveniently, I've done research on both of these characters for class,(Don't. Don't ask.) and while Rorschach is a neat character, he doesn't really stand much on his own, because of the elements of the plot in that story he plays into. A lot of the themes are lost if you compare just him to another comic-book character. I'm not much for cheesy superhero comics, but there's some pretty swag batman story-arcs out there, and he's a surprisingly endurant and multifaceted character. Definitely more lasting appeal.	0
I have every right this is my opinion who are you to question it?	Everything should be questioned and believing something on faith is just silly (that is my opinion, question it if you like). If someone believes something on faith and not on proof/evidence then it just shows that they do not care whether or not it is true. Questioning things and looking at the evidence is what drives advances, that is why science advances and religion does not.	0
You really can't compare these two games, Far Cry 3 is a first person shooter action game, Walking Dead is a story telling game similar to Heavy Rain. I'm not saying Far Cry 3 is bad, I'v liked the series so far but since Far Cry 3 hasn't even been released yet I'll have to go with the Walking Dead.	Don't forget that this is Activison's version of the Walking Dead, the one that focuses around all of the capping zombies, not the episodes. I should probably have made that more clear above.	0
Police do injustice and violence all the time. They do a whole lot of kidnapping, theft, and assault. It may be that they do more violating of rights than protecting of them. As a group, it seems to me they are more busy committing violence than most if not all others.	They use the publics fear of crime to justify there actions at least in court	0

"Actually, if you recall correctly we entered the war after Japan attacked. We knew better then to get involved with a war that we didn't have anything to do with. Of course then there's the fact that Hitler was committing genocide, but at the time we didn't know the full extent of the atrocities he was committing. FDR was clever though. He was still helping the British without actually going to war, with the ""Lend-Lease"" policy. Iraq had an al-Qaeda base in their country before we attacked? This is news to me but I'll take your word for it. Was this the reason we were given for going to war? Was this why we bombed other areas? Is this why we're still there? Clearly the pretenses for sacrificing soldiers and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were not anything like what you are implying."	"ignore what Kuklapolitan said, there was more than one reason for going into Iraq... i don't see why people always have to say ""was it this, or this"", it was a longer process than just ""WMDs or al-Qaeda"". here was the fact, Saddam was trying to get uranium, he had even told a reporter that he was planning on restarting his nuclear program, we already knew that he had chemical WMDs, he had violated a shit load of UN resolutions, had al-Qaeda forces in Iraq (we all remember the major al-Qaeda leader al-Zarqawi who was there way before we entered). Hell, him committing genocide was the least of OUR problems, but it sure as hell was another factor that was added for our attack."	0

Hydro-electric definatley. Wind power takes up too much room. 66.66666666% of our planet is water, why not use the water. It makes no noise. It does not look ugly.	Yes, 66.6% of the planet is water but one can't simply plonk a turbine in the sea and say job done. Really, it's only done along fast flowing rivers with Hydro electric dams, and that has a lot of negative impacts like deforestation and drop in water levels and decimation of fish species and displacement of people.... and I would argue hydro-electric dams can look very very ugly	0
Yeah, guns will be much harder to get. we are currently being ran by the Democratic Party. I don't think guns will banned (unless they want a Revolution on their hands), but licenses will be harder to get, many assault rifles will be impossible to get, and ammo will be much more limited, along with all the neat little gadgets you get with them (although, i don't like most of that shit cause i just feel more accurate with a stock weapon).	Who needs an assault rifle? Really	0
Yeaaah. It's so easy to shoot down religion. I mean, it helps that it's 100% false, but still, most lies are at least somewhat defendable. I mean, the only way to deny evolution is to brain damage yourself and believe that the world is 6000 years old. If evolution didn't happen, what did? Creationism? hahahahahahaha' It's not funny. Stay away from my children. (Not you Cuaroc, just the creationists.)	I've already said this before. I am not a Creationist, but a Catholic whose Church already accepts most forms of evolutionary science. I personally am aghast at the complete lack of evidence for the two engines of Darwinism- namely random mutation and natural selection. Random mutation = still-born mutant offspring, natural selection = rare instances of overpopulation	0
Psychological disorder you mean! Of course not, religion is of no great philosophy, nor psychology! Religion is for the weak minded who can't cope with the idea of death.	Religion has a philosophy. Even St. Thomas reiterated that. It also has morals and principles in life. What about you? What is your idea of death then? Just dying?	0
I think that evolution, regardless of the insane amount of errors and faulty science, will continue to gain popularity. I agree also with Cuaroc to an extent as well. By the time I die, the only real battle will be between Islam and the atheists... Christianity will be almost completely wiped out.	Gain popularity? How can you say that when a growing number of scientists, including some atheists, are beginning to question and doubt the theory of Darwinian evolution with each passing day. More and more books are being published which attacks Darwinism directly and profoundly. These increasing doubts about the truth of Darwinism are not going to stop. THEY WILL CONTINUE to increase and Darwinism is refuted once and for all. Wake up!	0
Micro-evolution and macro-evolution are one and the same. The only difference is the scale at which they occur. Micro-evolution occurs over a short period of time, Macro-evolution occurs over a long period of time. If you admit that micro-evolution occurs, and if you admit that life has been around for a long time, the only conclusion one can make is that macro-evolution has occurred. To say otherwise is to defy logic.	"Micro evolution and Macro evolution are not one and the same. 1. By their definitions they are very different - micro evolution says that animals adapt to their surroundings - macro evolution says they change into a new species. Those are two thoroughly different ideas. 2. We have never witnessed macro evolution take place - we have seen many examples of micro evolution, all of which have happened over a very short period of time. This is contrary to theories involving macro evolution where change occurs over an immense period of time. First of all, your statement is biased by saying ""if I ADMIT that life has been around for a long time"", this is not a fact, it is the view of you and some scientists. The view of other scientists is that the earth has been around a relatively short amount of time, around 6000-7000 years. Terminator gives strong evidence for the latter with his evidence. And do you know why many in the scientific community believe in macro evolution? Because they have been fed propaganda in school all their life. Why not teach both creation and evolution is schools? At least if these scientists are truly open minded. I can see teaching just creation in schools, because there is so much more evidence for it, but teaching only evolution? It's very unfortunate that the atheists have taken over our school system and our now feeding evolutionist propaganda to students."	0

One can agree with someone generally but not agree with them entirely, and I often find myself curious as to the reasoning behind a point that I agree with and question that.  I wish you did that. Instead you drone on until no one wants to read what you wrote. As to my text being unreadable- it's wordy, but far from unreadable, and I've had numerous discussions with those who didn't seem to have any difficulty following what I'm writing. Hehe, you did it again. You had 2 periods in that last paragraph. Boring the audience doesn't count as a win.	But that is precisely what I do; droning on beyond the attention span of some users and digging more deeply into others arguments are not mutually exclusive. And I also think that the biggest problem with debate is the idea that one side or the other has to 'win.' Really, it should be a win for both sides. I should also note that being antagonistic for the sake of being antagonistic is not a win either, friend. At any rate, we've gotten quite far off topic; the start of it was only tangentially related and now we're debating debate styles. I'm done here, but by all means reply again if you feel you must.	0
Why don't we admit both sides are taking heat. You can't celebrate publicly, well neither can Satanists.

For one thing, all you talked about is how we would benefit from Puerto Rico becoming a state. What about them? There aren't nearly as many benefits or the Puerto Ricans as there are for us. It harms their culture, one of the biggest things in Puerto Rico. They would have to make English their primary language when only about a quarter of Puerto Ricans speak English fluently. Teaching the majority of the population how to speak English wouldn't be an easy task and it definitely affects their culture. The Puerto Ricans would also be hurt economically. Although we (Americans) may gain from this new state, it would just hurt them because there is a significant difference between their economy and ours. Their wages and bills are exceptionally smaller than ours. A sudden transition to higher bills could create economic unstableness for the Puerto Ricans therefore causing more problems for the United States because we would have to make up for the problems there. Making Puerto Rico a state wouldn’t be nearly as easy as you make it seem, especially since we are dealing with plethora of people who do not want to become part of the United States of America. They would much rather stay on their own. So think about it, is it worth putting all of the states effort into making Puerto Rico a state when its own people don’t want that?	English is actually one of the official languages of Puerto Rico. Although many speak Spanish, they are taught English from elementary school to high school and even into college.	0

Let's be reasonable. To even imagine spending every waking moment is ludicrous. If I see a crime, I report it. Shoplifters, drunk drivers, reckless drivers, are among the list. Any unusual behavior, I check it out. If it appears to be of a criminal nature, I call the sheriff's office or the police. I get involved enough that I pursue suspects until help arrives.  To do any less than this is to promote crime. To do these things is the responsibility of every citizen. Crime affects all of us. The store charges more to cover the cost of theft. Drunk drivers may cause an accident or death. Do you really want them on road the same time as your family members and friends are? Reckless drivers are a hazard as well and maybe under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or have been involved in a crime. When I see a car run through four red lights, they get reported.  Yes, I've ended up face to face with a few. I had the tar scared out of me once, but I continue to do what is the right thing to do. I wasn't really expecting to find anybody inside the neighbors barn, when they where on vacation. A car appeared to be broke down and I called it in. Meanwhile I decided to make sure everything was in its place while waiting on the sheriff's duty to arrive, I now wait for them to arrive. Stumbled across two guys looking the place over. They ran and I ran the other direction, didn't like the odds. Still caught them anyway, I had their car boxed in.	If you are telling the truth, then what you do is very respectable.  But you admit to finding yourself in unsafe situations as a direct result of your actions. It is very conceivable that interfering with a crime in progress could be dangerous or fatal. It should be legally acceptable, if perhaps not morally so, for a person to decide not to endanger their own safety.	0
...The value of Gold is the value we give it. It's just as arbitrary as paper money, only it causes deflation.	Yes, but it works differently than paper money. Gold is considered valueable because its a rare metal, paper money is based on how much gold, silver or speculation there is to back it up. In my opinion, having everyone use the bi-metal or gold standard and had the printing of money being highly regulated, the currency would be much more stable.	0

Humans are a different species from apes.  Apes are not a species. They are a family. And humans are part of that family, along with chimps, gorillas, etc. We are classed together based on a set of traits that seperates apes from other families of primate. Our direct ancestor was an ape as well, as were the common ancestors that link us to other members of the ape family. So yeah, we descended from apes, just not any that are still around.	I reject your statement with this note. Apes are their own species inside the hominidae family. We did not evolve from apes we evolved from a different species that grandfathered the current primate species that we have today. Humans did not evolve from apes. Apes being the key word there. we descended from an ancient being that would classify as a member of the hominidae family. However, apes are a separate evolutionary track then human. The differences between human and ape are huge as well as their similarities.	0

I know what you say is true - but I'm a libertarian, I want to be the boss of my own money. People who make 2000$ a month can barely survive - sure they have free healthcare and school, but what about food? Food is expensive, and especially where I live. And even if they had enough money to buy food and stuff, why am I supposed to pay for their school system, what if I don't even want to go to school myself? And the free healthcare and education is not as good as you think - because it is free, there is no competition, and competition is good - when you compete, you try to be better than everyone else, there is no need for that here, because everything is sponsored by the country. Also hospitals and the education isn't the best you can get when it's free - because the hospitals and the schools are not on a very high budget, therefore they can't hire the best doctors or the best teachers. I'd rather pay my hospital bill, and get real healthcare, than get free crappy healthcare, and I'd rather pay for my education, and get a real one, than get a crappy one for free. More and more people who have the money to do it, choose a private school, because they are much much much better - and MOST of the people can't afford schools like that, because 60-70% of their salary goes to taxes. Yes, I feel bad for those who can't afford to provide school for their children. But if I want to donate my money to those kids, I want to do it voluntarily.	but I'm a libertarian, I want to be the boss of my own money. Then you are not a libertarian, you've just drank their koolaid. Find an issue of freedom, any, where individual clashes with business, and you will find libertarians are suddenly less concerned with individuals and more concerned with business. The fact is we are social and our societies at this time depend on exchange of goods and services through money. The money you have is always controlled by outside forces. The less say society has in that does not result in more say for you, it results in more say for whatever fills that void, in the libertarian world--big business.  The difference between society control and business control is you have a say in one and not in the other. Libertarians support less freedom for everyone ultimately accept the very few richest of the richest who can afford themselves their own police, schooling, roads, etc (we're talking 7 million a month, not 7 thousand), everyone else is at their mercy, what prices they set, how well they decide to check the food they make for disease, what schools they deem should be made affordable for you. This is the ultimate result of libertarianism, which is why it is only attractive to the young and inexperienced and to the older and slightly unhinged.  People who make 2000$ a month can barely survive - sure they have free healthcare and school, but what about food? Food is expensive, and especially where I live. True. Now imagine they don't have healthcare or school as well. That is the result. And the free healthcare and education is not as good as you think - because it is free, there is no competition, and competition is good - when you compete, you try to be better than everyone else, there is no need for that here, because everything is sponsored by the country. etc. Theoretically, but not in practice. Every single country with Universal care pays less for better care. This is a long established fact, and the only thing clouding that debate is the money private care in the U.S. and abroad is able to spend on ad campaigns telling you to say what you just said.  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita'>What countries pay per capita <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems'>What they get for that money More and more people who have the money to do it, choose a private school, because they are much much much better - and MOST of the people can't afford schools like that, because 60-70% of their salary goes to taxes. This is a misconception, a huge one. Private and public schools perform the same when compared across socio-economic class.	0

7 billion, 2 billion Christians What about it? How would that mean 5 billion people would be killed? You would achieve the same end result as Hitler if you were given power: genocide / You yourself said that the punishment for sins was death, therefore those that refure to see the light must be killed / It doesn't really matter what your justification is, most of these people have committed the same crimes as you have, and I bet most of they are as sorry as you are. / You refuse to treat other humans the same way you would like to be treated yourself, you are a hypocrite. I don't think you are seeing what I am telling you. I have been talking about God's judgement and punishment for the wicked, not a worldly judgement for wrong doing. God will judge, after we have died this worldly death, and sentence us to hell. I have done wrong, just as everyone else has done wrong. But the reason I do not fear, nor hold any animosity towards God, is because I have been saved! Christ promised me that He has died in my place and that I will not be seen as guilty before God's throne: Christ took upon Himself my punishment, so that I may be seen as righteous! The punishment for sin is death, and God will administer death upon all who have sinned. I deserve this punishment; I deserve to die; I admit this. But, my sins have been pushed as the east is from the west.	How would that mean 5 billion people would be killed? You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. Christ promised me that He has died in my place and that I will not be seen as guilty before God's throne: Christ took upon Himself my punishment, so that I may be seen as righteous! Terrible morality. You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? It is fair after all >:)	0

Humans are animals. Killing without need is always wrong. He did not need to kill that horse. We do not need to kill to eat meat, with our modern knowledge and technologies. If I was being attacked, human or non-human, there would be no qualms about killing for survival. I don't see how you don't understand. We are dominant over, not only other species, but other people. How is it completely different? I guess they said that about slavery.	Humans are animals. Yet many animals are not human.  The guy probably killed the animal for a need, because he was hungry, primarily.  He did need to kill it because he was hungry.  How to you propose humans eat meat without killing the meat they eat?

Apathetic, yes. I wouldn't go so far as to label all cannabis consumers as air heads but apathy never made anyone look like an intelligent, informed activist. This is a grassroots effort and there are a lot of people who are very vocal and driven reformists. It is disappointing however, that out of all the tens of millions of marijuana smokers, only a tiny fraction are..., what, motivated?, passionate?, angry? enough to get involved in their own liberation.  How many more lives need to be destroyed before all responsible cannabis consumers stand up and demand an end to marijuana prohibition?

That would be like saying humans are equal to God. There are very few cases when the creation is superior or equal to the creator.	"Sentience in no way requires the existence of god, and the created is only the created insofar as its coming into existence is a direct application of human mind and body in the manufacturing of the thing in question, however, there have already been simulations in which robots were ""engineered"" in an evolutionary environment and were selected for by effectiveness in performing a certain task, these designs were then 3D printed and were assembled, in this respect humans were only necessary to set up the process of evolution, they were not integral to the design. This could happen on a much more advanced level and sentience in syntheic beings could be attained."	0

I see, my mistake. If you remove the dog DNA nucleus of an egg cell, and replace it with a cat cell, the resulting cell will be 99.9% cat, but it would not grow into a baby. This has been done with a human cell and a cow cell. If you are talking about trying to fertilize a dog egg with a cat's sperm, it would not work because of the abovementioned genetic divergence and chromosomal disparity.	I see, my mistake. If you remove the dog DNA nucleus of an egg cell, and replace it with a cat cell, the resulting cell will be 99.9% cat, but it would not grow into a baby. This has been done with a human cell and a cow cell. So, if DNA were the main cause of body shape, that should grow viably. But it doens't. That is why I'm hesitant to believe evolution. The Cambrian Explosion has too many new body shapes in too little time. Random mutations cannot account for that. If you are talking about trying to fertilize a dog egg with a cat's sperm, it would not work because of the abovementioned genetic divergence and chromosomal disparity. I understand this part, yes.

I don't even know what love is, or how I would begin to distinguish it from 'true' love, so for that reason I have to say no. I firmly believe that everyone has a breaking point that can shatter 'love' and if it can be broken how can it be true?	Just set your negative emotions aside then talk out your problems. You can slowly repair the relationship. It's when you are able to take the time to fix the mistakes you've made and clear up misunderstandings. By doing that you are showing that you truly love that person and want to spend your life with them. It's understandable that some mistakes can't be fixed and in my opinion if you did something so terrible to hurt your significant other(like cheating on them) then you truly never loved them.	0

I agree, it's not always good, it does lead to horrible thoughts and actions (rape being the only thing I can really think of), but if you think rape is the only outcome of lust, you're missing out. So, if me and my girlfriend have this evil thing lust, and we have sex, and we're both happy, is that wrong? No one is harmed, no one is hurt, no one has to even know. I agree that lust isn't always good, no human emotion is, but it's one of the better ones overall. Religion is supposed to bring people together, not push them apart. And people have always been having sex, trying to stop them is futile.	If you and your girlfriend had the evil lust thing and had sex and you both are happy then that is wrong because 1. Your suppose to have sex when your married.(That is my opinion.) 2. If you keep wanting to have sex every single day with your girlfriend then that means your into your girlfriend more than everything else.	0

"I think it is a bit idiotic to go out of your way to look for things that probably aren't there.

Unless there are any sensible conspiracy theories that aren't loaded to the brim with obvious bullshit You mean like the ones that ignore the laws of physics?

"You basically say in your argument that time exists: ""Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed."" I have no problem with that definition, and it says time (not the word but the ""process"") exists without humans. So humans did not create it."	"Then you misunderstood completely. With that I did not say that time exists. With that all I said was how we see ""time"", how we interpret it. In reality it does not exist as a part of our universe, as some ""force"". It is simply the effect of the structure of our universe. Without the things making the effect possible there would be no such thing."	0
I appreciate and respect your comprehensive responses. I still feel you discount the factual reality that DNA is extremely, incredibly complex and WOULD NEVER HAVE FORMED naturally, randomly, or by chance alone in some warm pool of water somewhere. The odds are far too high and have been calculated by more than one researcher. Non-organic matter cannot suddenly become organized or even a little bit better organized. Chaos from order is the law of the universe, order from chaos requires the interference of an intelligent, creative force, perhaps even a supernatural one,	"I still feel you discount the factual reality that DNA is extremely, incredibly complex and WOULD NEVER HAVE FORMED naturally, randomly, or by chance alone in some warm pool of water somewhere.  Certainly not. It more likely evolved from RNA, which is phenomenally simpler.  There is one HUGE problem with most of the odds calculations that come up in these discussions: They always go straight from nothing to something very complex. The very point behind the theory of evolution is that it happens very slowly, incrementally, one step at a time. You can't calculate the odds of even a simple bacteria forming from thin air, because no evolutionist is claiming they came from thin air. They came from a simpler bacteria, and simpler, and simpler, down to complex protobionts, down to simple protobionts, down to non-replicating masses of organic matter, down to individual organic molucules, down to elements. Every time you move up the chain, you have to reset your calculations to start at the previous step. You have to ask ""What are the odds of this bacteria becoming the next strain of bacteria.  darn near every researcher who has run the math, made these claims and gained notoriety for it has come under scrutiny for making too big of gaps, not having enough information to calculate the odds accurately or misinterpreting what they are calculating. It happens over and over again, and these errors are why such calculations rarely if ever gain credence in the scientific community. Math does not lie, but mathematicians can, or at least can make mistakes in mathematical application.  Non-organic matter cannot suddenly become organized or even a little bit better organized.  This is patently false. The laws of chemistry are extremely complex and can have an extremely wide range of results. Some order, some disorder. You can witness this first hand in any good college chemistry lab. The laws of chemistry, combined with the materials in question and the surrounding environment can sometimes have incredibly orderly effects. Look at crystals. Those masses of crystal did not always have the orderly patterns they display when we unearth them.  Chaos from order is the law of the universe, order from chaos requires the interference of an intelligent, creative force, perhaps even a supernatural one, No, it does not. There are examples contradictory to your statement in every field of science.  You are right that it is a trend, but not one that cannot be at least temporarily overpowered. Everything eventually breaks down, but for a time order can be promoted, maintained and increased within an almost infinite array of observed systems before eventually breaking down."	0

"Money, isn't really all that important. There are many reasons to support this. I mean, everyone can do everything we do today without money but people insist on living greedy, selfish, untrusting, war provoking, destructive lives. Without money we would most likely all live in harmony and peace with one another because if we could take one lesson with us from money. It would be that we all need to work together just to survive. Less profit for one and more for the whole would be the result. The native tribes lived without money and were very likely to give members of their tribe gifts of things they did not have. Didn't have a place to live? One would be built for you. If a harvest proved to provide little for the tribe. Everyone starved because it would be divided up evenly. Hell, I bet even the religious people would agree with me here when I say ""even jesus christ was for this method. When he fed thousands with a few loaves of bread and some fish."""

Keep in mind that the exercising of the religion must not affect people around them that wish to not be disturbed by it.

As long as we don't bring up religion.. And doesn't matter whether I am antisemitic or not, that's no excuse to say Jewish people are not people.

"While it may be true that it's impossible to ""know anything with absolution"" I don't see how this logically follows from ""science is man made"". Please explain. I don't think it's impossible to have any absolutely correct beliefs. What is unwise about me being absolutely certain that I typed this response? Is not my knowledge that I did so absolutely correct?"	Science is man made because science is simply studying and observing things around us empirically, which is basically taking detailed notes. Epistemology is the study of how knowledge is obtained, and our science is just one way, our science just makes sense, but it doesn't mean it is a absolute.	0
"I personally think the term ""supernatural evidence"" is an oxymoron. How can one have evidence for that which is outside the bounds of empiricism?"

It is my belief that when these supernatural claims and evidence are examined, we will find a naturalistic explanation for how and why these events occurred.	0

Please post these. I've been arguing under the impression that the death penalty was having a negligible affect on crime rates, but a report showing the opposite would definitely make a difference in my stance."	This is a more intense detailed facts of the study conducted. Using a panel data set of over 3,000 counties from 1977 to 1996, Professors Hashem Dezhbakhsh, Paul R. Rubin, and Joanna M. Shepherd of Emory University found that each execution, on average, results in 18 fewer murders.[17] Using state-level panel data from 1960 to 2000, Professors Dezhbakhsh and Shepherd were able to compare the relationship between executions and murder incidents before, during, and after the U.S. Supreme Court's death penalty moratorium.[18] They found that executions had a highly significant negative relationship with murder incidents. Additionally, the implementation of state moratoria is associated with the increased incidence of murders. Separately, Professor Shepherd's analysis of monthly data from 1977 to 1999 found three important findings.[19] First, each execution, on average, is associated with three fewer murders. The deterred murders included both crimes of passion and murders by intimates. Second, executions deter the murder of whites and African-Americans. Each execution prevents the murder of one white person, 1.5 African-Americans, and 0.5 persons of other races. Third, shorter waits on death row are associated with increased deterrence. For each additional 2.75-year reduction in the death row wait until execution, one murder is deterred. Professors H. Naci Mocan and R. Kaj Gittings of the University of Colorado at Denver have published two studies confirming the deterrent effect of capital punishment. The first study used state-level data from 1977 to 1997 to analyze the influence of executions, commutations, and removals from death row on the incidence of murder.[20] For each additional execution, on average, about five murders were deterred. Alternatively, for each additional commutation, on average, five additional murders resulted. A removal from death row by either state courts or the U.S. Supreme Court is associated with an increase of one additional murder. Addressing criticism of their work,[21] Professors Mocan and Gittings conducted additional analyses and found that their original findings provided robust support for the deterrent effect of capital punishment.[22] Two studies by Paul R. Zimmerman, a Federal Communications Commission economist, also support the deterrent effect of capital punishment. Using state-level data from 1978 to 1997, Zimmerman found that each additional execution, on average, results in 14 fewer murders.[23] Zimmerman's second study, using similar data, found that executions conducted by electrocution are the most effective at providing deterrence.[24] Using a small state-level data set from 1995 to 1999, Professor Robert B. Ekelund of Auburn University and his colleagues analyzed the effect that executions have on single incidents of murder and multiple incidents of murder.[25] They found that executions reduced single murder rates, while there was no effect on multiple murder rates. In summary, the recent studies using panel data techniques have confirmed what we learned decades ago: Capital punishment does, in fact, save lives. Each additional execution appears to deter between three and 18 murders. While opponents of capital punishment allege that it is unfairly used against African-Americans, each additional execution deters the murder of 1.5 African-Americans. Further moratoria, commuted sentences, and death row removals appear to increase the incidence of murder. The strength of these findings has caused some legal scholars, originally opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds, to rethink their case. In particular, Professor Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago has commented: If the recent evidence of deterrence is shown to be correct, then opponents of capital punishment will face an uphill struggle on moral grounds. If each execution is saving lives, the harms of capital punishment would have to be very great to justify its abolition, far greater than most critics have heretofore alleged.[26]	0

"Don't be ridiculous. I love marijuana. But it doesn't cloud my mind to not see some truth to what is being said.  Excerpts from the original essay (published in ""Under the Influence: The Disinformation Guide to the War on Drugs""):  According to federal drug surveys, about 11 million Americans smoke marijuana at least once a month...Out of these people, NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, had a little more than 10,000 members in late 2003. The Marijuana Policy Project had around 13,500. The Drug Policy Alliance had 10,500....In contrast, the National Rifle Association has 4 million members. The average stoner might turn out for festival-style protests like the Bostom Freedom Rally and the Seattle Hempfest, which draw tens of thousands of people every year, but strictly political rallies---that is, ones where you're there to make a point and can't smoke--are lucky to get 100. Compare this to the 'beer parades' of 1932, the anti-Prohibition rallies that drew 15,000 people in Detroit and over 100,000 in New York. They were not about getting drunk. They were relatively sober, if festive affairs where people held up signs that read 'We Want Beer and We Will Pay the Tax,' and charts explained how a tax on alcohol could help get the country out of the Depression. "	"I think the very fact that 11 million Americans smoke weed, yet it's not legal, makes many of us wonder how much progress will be made at any sort of political rally. After all, people have been fighting for this cause since my mother was a child. That's why I'm not in NORML, because I honestly don't see anything happening about it; America has a vendetta against pot. Not to mention, pot has a very high number of people who casually sell, as compared to other drugs. Lots of people hook their friends up without being ""dealers"", but this makes them reluctant to openly support groups which will directly tie them to pot."	0
in a nutshell true freedom. Freedom to unlock everyones full potential and excel us all, I and many of us feel that the monetary system is outdated and is no longer needed, yes we needed it to get to this point but it spiraled out of control and it's a major problem and will eventually kill us all if we don't change our social structure.	I agree, Warjin.  Humans cannot agree as a whole on anything at all, and nothing of any real circumstance would last. When countries get greedy or start to become hostile to another country, their prices fluctuate. But without money, someone would eventually try and ask for monetary payment, and just like that, it'd be back. However, I despise money and what it does to our species, and has done. If I thought a 'free' world would work, (an idea I had when I was a child, actually) then I'd push the idea, but alas, it simply won't work.	0

Nope, any logical person who was smart enough to develop a device to travel in time, would be smart enough to go back in time and give it to themselves, therefore eliminating a need to create it in the first place, therefore they couldn't have invented it in the first place, and therefore couldn't go back in time to give it to himself. Thus I present to you, the Time paradox.	Any logical person would realize that going back in time and giving the time machine to themselves would create a time paradox so they would never create the paradox in the first place. Besides time travel would probably be through a worm hole and it would be a one way trip. Also, if the multiverse theory is correct then going back in time would just create an alternate universe since the future would not of been written yet. So you could possible give yourself the time machine because you created it in another universe not affected by your meddling with the past.	0

 Apparently the early formation of our solar system was in the vicinity of thousands of young stars and exploding supernovas. Just wondering, how do 'they' ('them' being the generic people who say things) know this? Is it becasue they looked far enough away to equate the age of the sun and figure what they see was uniform throughout the universe. Or is it because the look at the evidence and form a theory to explain it in a way that takes God out of the picture. Not that doing so is a bad thing, but it is bad to pass that theory as fact in absense of evidence.  This would trigger the birth of our sun before all mass would be pulled towards the center, and it would expel heavier elements towards it. If the sun was 'birthed' before there was enough mass to naturally light it, wouldn't the force of fusion push the vital hydrogen away from the core, making it impossible to continue burning naturally? There isn't just one dialect in America but dozens, some are unintelligible to the uninitiated. I know this, too. The list was symbollic. I obviously didn't list all the dialects and their parents.	Just wondering, how do 'they' ('them' being the generic people who say things) know this? Is it becasue they looked far enough away to equate the age of the sun and figure what they see was uniform throughout the universe. Bits of evidence are left behind, like certain radioactive isotopes and we can observe the formation of stars in the universe with our massive telescopes. We look at history every day when we look to the sky, because our universe is so vast and light travels so slowly. We can observe the past-formation of stars, exploding supernovas, etc. By making these and other observations we can deduce how our early solar system must have been. Or is it because the look at the evidence and form a theory to explain it in a way that takes God out of the picture. Not that doing so is a bad thing, but it is bad to pass that theory as fact in absense of evidence. As explained before: god is not science. Science does not work by invoking magic, or sacrificing animals to an altar. It relies on the knowable, which requires that we do not invoke supernatural, magical concepts. When you invoke god, you enter the territory of the unknowable, which means that you can never expand knowledge since you cannot verify your claims. If the sun was 'birthed' before there was enough mass to naturally light it, wouldn't the force of fusion push the vital hydrogen away from the core, making it impossible to continue burning naturally? It was not ignited prematurely but bits of dense mass were hurled into it, accelerating the process greatly. I know this, too. The list was symbollic. I obviously didn't list all the dialects and their parents. What then are your objections remaining? We see that languages diverge, create new words and grammar schemes, so how can you maintain that language is getting simpler when more keep popping up?	0

Of course. In my school, we are allowed mobile phones only for their calculators. But, people still, when given the opportunity use them for texting. This disrupts the lessons momentum, if the teacher has to stop, and reduces the amount learned. Of course people will argue that it can be used for other purposes. But the pupils will take advantage of this. Also, some people may be poor/other and will not be able to have a mobile phone. This could lead to bullying.	Smartphones these days have really good apps for schools use. I use my phone everyday in school. If people want to text during a lesson, it is their problem.

Black ops is so cool I love it you get to make your own emblem and the new maps are awesome with the ziplines I play it literally all the time apart from when i have other things more important to do rather than homework then Black ops is defiantly the best.	Black ops is a decent game at best. It was by far the worst in the entire CoD series however. The hit detection is poor, lag is awful, game play is OK, and the campaign is the most ridiculous in the entire history of gaming. Even Halo's premise is mildly feasible.	0

"Whenever a human possesses the power of the sun and uses it, it's never necessary and in fact is irresponsible.  Regardless of the notion, ""Kill X, amount, save another X, amount"".  What America did was wrong, plain and simple.  War is war, however, the bombing of Japan was not War. That is called annihilation. That is precisely called ""humans playing god"".  Humans are already a destructive species. Humans do not need to have, nor have needed to use, nuclear and/or atomic weaponry."	We did warn them though . Also we were still in war.	0

Monarchs had a much better establishment of power. Also they had a larger span of influence.	But if they have a bad influence, then surely that;s a bad thing?  If say the queen of England decides to to something terrible involving the welfare state (even though she cannot that simply) because she has more influence, not only will those affected by the changes suffer, but it will cause leaders world wide to take action. And if there is a dictator like monarch who has more power than a dictator, wouldn't that be a worse thing too?	0
And then they die! We live about 80 years on average. The goal of evolution isn't necessarily a long lifespan, but survival of the genes. By constantly propagating, they ensure a bulk of organisms carry their genes. That is why they are superior in this regard. In eighty years they could practically cover the world, and there will just be you.	Evolution has a goal? Would that not be theistic evolution? If evolution is chance, then there is nobody to ascribe said goal.	0
That's not how evolution works. Let me give you an example to help clarify the process. In a species, one of the animals has some sort of mutation. That animal continues to breed and passes along this mutation to its ancestors. Only that one animal and its descendants will have that mutation. All the other animals of that species that don't descend from the one with the mutation will stay the same. For example, some humans are born with dwarfism. That means people with dwarfism evolved from average sized humans. Thinking that monkeys shouldn't exist if humans evolved from them is the same as thinking that average sized humans shouldn't exist because dwarfs evolved from them, or black people shouldn't exist because white people evolved from them. They are all just different branches of the evolutionary tree.  Technically speaking, humans didn't evolve from the monkeys we see today. Both humans and all the other primates evolved from a common ancestor. Each species of primates is just another branch on the evolutionary tree. <a href='http://www.vi.cl/gepe/f33027.jpg'>Here's a very rudimentary phylogenetic tree showing some of the branches of primate evolution. A complete phylogenetic tree would have many more branches.	A dwarf can have a full sized baby, and a midget can too. Even if it is two midgets who breed they can still have full grown children. I agree on a common ancestor however our common ancestor is called neandrathol. Which implies it wasn't human. My argument is just stating we didn't evolve from apes. Apes are what are around today. (Edit: I was wrong Neanderthals were not a direct ancestor but we are closely related. Anywho, your rudimentary tree supports what I am saying anyway.)	0
Yes, it matters, and I think that the Supreme Court should definitely hear the case. But at the same time, I'm of the mind that saying a prayer at a town meeting does not come anywhere close to falling under 'law respecting the establishment of a religion.' I'm of the mind that banning prayer in government buildings, schools, et al is in fact infringing upon the rights of free speech and religious expression of all of those involved. Having to listen to somebody else praying in no way infringes on one's own rights. The case for banning prayer has no substance and no leg to stand on as far as I'm concerned, even if I'm not much for praying myself.	Saying an opening prayer at a town meeting is giving legal preference and acknowledgment to a particular religion or to religion generally. It is quite distinct from an individual saying a prayer at a meeting, as the latter is a case of individual expression rather than a collectively sanctioned statement by the governing body. You miss this distinction entirely. Opponents to organized prayer at government meetings (or in public schools, etc.) do not generally or widely propose to ban individuals from praying in any setting. The objection lies with the institutionalized observation of prayer. I further contend that institutionalized observation of prayer is just as equally problematic in its exclusion of agnostics, atheists, and anti-theists as it can be in its exclusion of other theistic persuasions. If we consider it objectionable that one religious group be given official preference over other religious groups because it represents an imposition of beliefs upon those who do not share them, upon what basis does one contest that the imposition of religious belief upon the non-religious is not similarly an imposition of beliefs upon those who do not share them? In both cases one group's beliefs are being forced upon others in an official, governmental capacity; the only difference is that generally more people are inclined to object if those imposed upon are religious than if that group is non-religious. This clearly demonstrates the preference and privilege of religiosity in the United States.	0
When we are talking about life fromed from a natural human reproductive, then why is the distinction between natural and artificial is unimportant when abortion has to do with natural and not artificial. It doesn't matter whether the abortifacent is natural or artificial. So you said it yourself again, so the fetus (human) has a heartbeat which maintains blood flow which is critical for life of the fetus? The foetus gets its fluids from the mother until it has a functioning heart. You said people who have coma has lost the functions of their brain but the brain is not fully gone. So, again this is my question to you; Even if they are not gone, they are still not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts, right? And this is similar to a fetus which has an intact brain with the presence of life but is not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts. A person in a coma has a brain which retains their identity as experiences. They have legal personhood too. A foetus has a brain that isn't fully formed and has no identity yet. An unconscious person at the time of losing their consciousness has lost their personhood according to scientific studies and legal examinations because at the time of losing consciousness their brain has temporarily shut down causing them to lose all the abilities or elements of personhood. You misunderstand. Higher level functions shut down, however the brain still operates. If a brain dead person cannot recover then how come in many cases brain dead people have recovered as in a case recently with a man becoming braindead but recovered after being in a major accident. You are causing a blot on the name of science. A braindead person cannot recover. That's what being braindead means. What could happen is that a person is misdiagnosed as braindead. Sort of like a century ago when a person might be misidentified as dead when in reality they were comatose. They would wake up sometimes. It isn't that dead people can recover. Are you saying that if the DNA identifies you as a different but living human that you should also disregard this? You are failing to realize that the lump of tissue you are referring to is the growing human body and you keep making reference to other tissues as if they can grow into a human being as well.  All that matters here is that they are tissues without identity. A human being isn't born with an identity and functioning brain. There are stages, a foetus is the stage when it's not really a person. Cloning again has nothing to do with sexual reproduction. Cloning is basically a copy of the DNA to produce humans with similar identity. Cloning is done by an artificial method whilst sexual reproduction is done within the human body and formed from a combination of reproductive cells. It doesn't matter if cloning is artificial. It still can produce people. Tumors are tissue growth i agree but you are making it seem as if the cells of tumors are formed from sexual reproduction. The growth of tumor tissues are caused by exposure to harzardous elements and chemicals or nuclear matters. Maybe we should start seeing if tumor cells can develop into a human being and if it also has developing organs, because you are comparing them to a fetus. A tumor, like a foetus, is unconscious tissue. It doesn't matter if foetal DNA is different, all that matters is that both are in a state of no consciousness, no identity. If the procedure is limited the whole fact is that they are still using them for clinical trials and this can have a major impact on the human systems and besides we all are aware that in a clinical trial, patients are exposing themselves to the risk of abnormalities, risks or body damage. So where are the rights of personhood or living rights? Those people are given consent forms. A foetus has no ability to give consent because it isn't a person.	The reference made to an atificial process is invaluable in this debate. The fact that the fetus is formed from sperm and then merges together with the ovum is in no way artificial.  The fluid that is feeded to the fetus from the mother causes the fetus to depend on survival for this fluid, right? So therefore if it has no life then how come it depends on survival? Don't living things depend on survival? They have a brain which retains their identity but they do not have a brain that is conscious and has full functions. And to be within the confines of personhood one has to have a brain that is fuctioning as that of a normal brain. A fetus brain is not fully formed but when compared to a person in coma, both are at the same level because there is the absence of the elements of personhood. This point i made is in reference to a Supreme Court trial which later became an ammendment to the law. For the person to lose the elements of personhood, he has to lose the higher functions of his brain which is to be self aware, conscious, have a level of understanding and to be able to touch, feel, think or move. Also the other element of survival as determined by scientists, doctors and even to a Supreme Court trial, is losing the ability to depend on themselves for survival. Thank you for making that point. A brain dead person CANNOT RECOVER BECAUSE THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN AND A IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE TISSUES AND STEMS OF THE BRAIN. IN A FETUS, THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND NOT DAMAGED AND ALSO THERE IS A NORMAL FLOW OF BLOOD TO THE BRAIN. IN THE FETUS THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND IN GOOD HEALTH BUT IN THE PERSON THERE IS NOT ANY HOPE OF FURTHER GROWTH AND ALSO RECOVERY. A FETUS IS BORNED AND NURTURED BUT A PERSON IN COMA CAN'T. If DNA does not matters then maybe they should stop using DNA to identify criminals because DNA identifies a different human identity which is used in the case if a father or mother wishes to identify their child, born or unborn. DNA gives it identity, not a brain. A brain performs and or control basic body functions. Even to doctors will attest to this. As far as i remember cloning has to do with copying DNA (HUMAN IDENTITY) and using it to create another. In the case of human sexual reproduction, the sperm is ejaculated out of the father into the canal of the mother where the process of fertilization takes place. This process takes place within the human body and not out of the human body. So i am of the opinion that the reference you are making is insignificant because the the fetus is formed from a natural process and not from an artificial process.  Firstly a fetus has DNA which a cancerous tissue does not have and also a fetus has organs which cancerous cells do not have. A fetus is developing into a human person. Can cancerous cells develop into a human person? Cancerous cells kills by feeding off of the body whilst fetus develops into a person.  The fetus cannot give consent i agree but what about the millions who are murdered without getting their consent?	0

Yes, it is 2013. And while there have been improvements there are still definitely hatred, intolerance, and discrimination. I should know. I have experienced all of them, as an atheist and especially as a queer transgender man. Queer people are still denied equal rights, are still attacked, are still fired, are still murdered simply for being who we are. Atheists are better situated but still face discrimination, especially in employment and elections, from which we receive little to no legal protection.  The rights I do have, no one gave to me. People like me fought and are still fighting for our rights. The most consistent, if not the only, opposition has always been religion and the religious. Whatever their holy books say, religion (and in the US Christianity especially) has been and still is the primary (if not the only) basis of hatred and discrimination against queer identifying people and atheists. This is not to say that all religious people are the problem, but that religion at large is.	I just posted a response to your other argument where I addressed why I think people treat homosexuals the way they do. So that we aren't having three different arguments in this debate (basically addressing the same things in each), I'll go ahead and leave this alone. You don't need to respond to this.	0
You really are an idiot arent you. Yes the sun is responsible for global warming of course it is, without it there would be no warming (and no life for that matter) of that is true but the primary casue of accelerated global warming as supported by the entire worlds scientific community is that the accelerated warming is due primarily to the increased concentration in the earths atmosphere of green house gases (CO2 and CH4) which cause certain wavelengths of light to be diffracted back into the earth when leaving, this is man made global warming and to disagree with the scientific consensus shows just how stupid a person you are me friend.Peace out.

The question was not about our choice, it is about His. Also, could you explain why a deist God would oppose universal health care? Would a deist God remain neutral in all human affairs?

"A. Laws some how magically stop criminals - I prefer my criminals unarmed B. a someone who has been robbed,raped,or murderd or all of the above is somehow morally superior to the person that defended themselves. - I just don't understand that argument, if someone steals my car and I shoot him, I have committed the crime of murder he has committed the crime of theft, who has committed the greatest sin? (you're the christian...) C. see response to A, also all the weapons in Sandy Hook were legally owned, again would it not be better if Adam Lanza had had to use a bread knife? D. The constitution is NOT SET IN STONE, it is not a biblical tablet, it can be amended by the will of the people through their government hence... there already are 27 AMENDMENTS. The 2nd amendment can be repealed if it is the will of the people.  ""the second amendment tells the government they cannot pass ANY laws restricting the people's right to keep and bare arms."" 1) The government can repeal the 2nd amendment  2) Am I / and should I be allowed to own my weaponized anthrax? The government in a democratic country are the representatives of the people, to rebel against them is to rebel against the people - if you want to change the government, vote for Sarah Palin."	First of all I would like criminals unarmed as well but telling a criminal he can't have a gun isn't going to do shit. Second of all you are allowed to defend yourself and your property all you have including your life you have gained through the blessings of The Lord your allowed to protect them. And no the second amendment cannot be repealed simply because the majority wants it to be. That would be a democracy which we are not we are a republic and in a republic people's freedom is protected by rights so the majority can't oppress the minority. A d so what if the weapons used in sandy hook where owned legally? There are over tow million responsible gun owners in this country you want to disarm everyone because some freak with autism wheat of the deep end screw you. Besides Adam Lanza's shooting spree would have been much shorter lived if at least one of those teachers had been armed too bad guns were banned in the building. Hey wait that would mean banning guns doesn't stop shooting sprees then and in fact makes them worse. Well duh	0
First I want to apologize for the delay in replying to this. I didn't even know you sent it until I saw it today.  Quite frankly, I value the opinions of those over the age of 10 to be the most relevant when discussing the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Fair enough. Than you should read The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil  Unless you create something biological, or possibly hybrid, then there is no evolution. And machinery is not biological. So if we become the machines than it'll count? That's definitely more than possible. People with Parkinson's disease can gain an artificial machine in their brain that apparently, they consider a part of themselves as it's very helpful with daily requirements. Artificial corneas have been made for the deaf, artificial retinas are being made for the blind, and artificial limbs can be attached to a human that'll give them strength beyond our normal ability.  But how far does it go? Can we keep our humanity if we're ten percent machinery? Twenty? Thirty?	So if we become the machines than it'll count?  I suppose. But the machinery itself wouldn't evolve. If a woman with a hip replacement has a child, the child isn't born with a hip replacement. However, I suppose we could become hybrid beings.  But how far does it go? Can we keep our humanity if we're ten percent machinery? Twenty? Thirty? Well, depends on what definition you're using. If we take it in a strictly biological way, then 0% is your answer. But if we take a more philosophical approach, you could have up to 99%, if you wished. As long as one is capable of all the things a non-hybrid could do, they are still human.	0
In my opion marriage is necessary because when you have a wife and kids and they grow up to be adults while my wife and I are old the kids need to take care of there parents because you never know cancer or something might happen to you and if you have no one to help you to the hospital or anyone the your in trouble. So I think marriage is useful.	so, someone won't help you if they don't marry you, people can love and not marry, some people out there don't think marriage is necessary to be in love. I do think its a great tradition, and a good idea, not necessary either.	0

but the advantages of being attractive are things that rich people get. So it's untrue to say that others don't get it.	I'll have to disagree. Until we can create a list of of advantages attractive people have, we can never decide fully if they are the only group to get them. I have never seen a rich person get treated like an attractive person unless the rich person was attractive, and I have seen ugly rich people get treated like ugly poor people.	0

Yes, because the ability to build a reactor the size of a small plate will contribute to non-proliferation. Give me a break! Stark is an megalomaniacal, egotistical, sophist. He is in no way reformed, and your attempts to lobby for him by degrading the great community and social work Batman has done is sour indeed.	The reactor he built was not a nuclear reactor. It therefore has absolutely nothing to do with non-proliferation of nuclear arms. In fact, IronMan's technological prowess would be invaluable to the movement for energy independence. There really is not much difference between the two. They are both doing exactly what they think the world needs them to do. My problem with Batman? Too emo. Seriously, a black bat? IronMan's suit though? Pure style.	0
Sure. But most schools have weighted GPAs that take that into account. Besides, the main reason GPA is so important is for the purpose of showing colleges yourself as a student to evaluate. Colleges can clearly distinguish between those who pad their GPA and those who care more about learning and challenging themselves.  But I digress, that's probably not even related...	You just pointed out that the grading system is not a good system to evaluate a student's performance. You need to know exactly what they were learning not what grade they got.	0

Schools are a mini-goverment. If they are modeled as democratic one they only have the right to block(make illegal during their time of governance) something which is likly to violate the rights of its citizens.  What school-rights does face-book violate? the right not to unwillingly be distracted in class which some claims is a derivative of the right of education? Facebook is something one is willingly on.  Does a student not have the right to fail? if a student does, then he should be able to distract himself.  Also, distraction is a terrible thing to measure and facebook's distraction is debatable. Also, the level of distraction of a thing is a emergent property of the environment your in along with yourself, for example its possible to completely block out your surroundings if the book your reading captures your attention enough, if not then someone talking can distract you from it. If there is distraction in the classroom, one could argue its because of the classroom.	"That's stupid. Did you just write the first thing in your head? Schools are NOT any sort of government.  They are, however, being given money to by US, the taxpayers, in hope that they will do a good job of educating our kids. Students are minors. If you're suggesting that they have individual freedoms, i could easily say that was completely wrong. If you were right, then wouldn't teenagers be voting? If there was a representation of the students ""rights"", that would lie in the taxpaying parent."	0
But don't you think that student will be just busy with using the makeup .. And checking if its ok and fix it at class room .	No. One can apply make up once, fix it in the batrhoom, that's it. No one with a brain will fix their make up in class. If one does it, it means they wouldn't benefit from the class anyways, so it's still alright. Make up is a personal choice. If they want it, let them wear it. If a student is interested in learning, make up won't stop them, nothing will. If a student isn't interested in learning, they won't learn no matter how many rules the school comes up with. So it's perfectly fine to allow students to wear make up to school, or even fix it there. It's their choice.	0

We do not suck at teaching children, the children do not pursue their dreams, or push themselves to study harder. We work hard to teach them, but they do not work hard themselves. Therefore,why teach a child a foreign language,if they won't use it. It will be a waste of time and money to hire the teachers. This is coming from a child herself. I am in elementary school.	In some ways, you are right. Students do not try. They do not care about school at all. Only a few students do, and those of us who care are essentially told not to care, by our peers or by adults around us. Not only, though, would students be learning new language, but it creates jobs. This also is coming from a student. In middle school.	0
Eh, it's kind of a six of one, half a dozen of the other situation. On average, women are smarter, but there are more male geniuses, so whatever floats your boat.	That's still basing it on who is smarter. I guess a better wording of the question who has better adapted to today? In a way I don't think men because as a majority they still hold onto that competition needed for survival, something is unnecessary now.  Then again, men are better able to prioritize. Women base too much on social acceptance, at least more than men, and this hurts them. So, like I said, there is no one, but I'm trying to better explain my question.	0
If they were actually strong and willing enough they wouldn't receive all the special care that they do. but they do.

"Part of being strong is being able to accept help when you need it. It's a reasonable accomidation to help people cope with their disabilities. How would the world be happier? There would still be people with disabilities, just fewer. You definition of ""happiness"" needs to be defined. Forced abortion, in your opinion."	0
A firmament never existed at any time. Light cannot come before the sun. A God didnt poof the world into existence. 2 people didnt give birth to the entire lineage of the human race.

Mathew 22:36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” We (Christians) don't make the rules.

Does anyone care at all about the natural order of things anymore???	First thing I will say is you need to make clear what you are meaning by the natural order, because as someone has already said if it is to do with what happens is nature, homosexuality occurs in nature.

Religion doesn't cause conflict, people do. This like arguing that guns kill; guns don't kill, people do.	I'm going to have to disagree unfortunately. Your argument seemed fairly reasonable when I read it, but after thinking about it I'm going to have to disagree. Religion DOES certainly encourage conflict (for the most part anyway). The difference between guns and religion is this: You can kill someone directly with a gun, but you can use religion as an indirect way of causing a conflict, or indeed, death.	0
They don't censor anything political or what not. Plus, there is a captive audience when it comes to the radio and TV...meaning that since the airwaves are limited choice is extremely limited and you just can't choose to not see something. Besides obscenity is not protected by the 1st amendment.  Miller v California sets community standards as the method of determining obscenity... that means it is up to the community determine what is okay and what is not	I am well aware that obscenity is not protected under the 1St Amendment due to the court ruling, but I have an issue with any law that has a ruling based on a judgment that requires subjective opinion. The test that the FCC uses, the Miller Test, is this:   1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,  2.Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law,  3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. (This is also known as the (S)LAPS test- [Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific.) The work is considered obscene only if all three conditions are satisfied. Requirement number three is the one I have the biggest issue with. To say something is artistic is completely subjective. The same could be said for political.  There are cases where it is clearly a political issue, but what about times where symbolism or allegory are being used? For example, if a person were to run an ad displaying people dying in a hospital to demonstrate that we need health care reform would that fall under political? I would say yes, but someone else might disagree and we would run into an issue over which side is right.	0
There are a multitude of reasons, but the here's the most simple: anyone who wants to succeed in college, or just understand the complexities of our world will need to understand the metric system, because most scientists describe the world with the metric system.	Soooo.... no one in the U.S. has ever been successful in college because we don't use the metric system? Huh! I did not know that!	0
I agree totally but we all know that our troops cannot stay in harms way forever! I know if Iraq needs help we are more than willing to do so but it must end at some time!	...And that would be when the nation can defend itself and police the terrorist regimes without foreign aid. :)	0
I went to King's Dominion a few days ago...It costs $35 to get in and a bottled water is $3.75, that's outrageous. That will surely take the leisure out of the equation. When someone decides to take their children to small park in the city, they don't expect to pay crazy prices so some hotshot gets richer.	How it that outrageous? Of course, a theme park is a little more expense than a leisure park because of operating and equipment costs. Therefore, it would be cheaper for entry with leisure parks, and if it makes you feel better, the government could set ordinances or laws setting a price floor. This practice is done with housing in urban areas. What about those people who are forced into paying more taxes in order to fund government parks who otherwise never go to the parks? Is that fair?  Why segregate parks? Theme parks are private, but leisure parks must be public. Where is the logic?	0
Puerto Rico is very proud of its Spanish language and culture.Although the island is bilingual, the language of the government, public schools, courts and 80 - 90% of the residents of Puerto Rico is Spanish and around 90% of Puerto Rico's high school graduates do not speak English well. There is a bill that was sent to Congress in 2006. Though the bill has not yet been passed, officials may still again attempt to make English the official language of the United States of America. If this bill and the creation of Puerto Rico as a state were both passed we would be forcing the 4 million new citizens to learn a completely new language.	The English argument is invalid, Puertorricans study English as a second language from elementary school threw High school. Also we have to take English courses in college(9-18 credits). I am not sure where do you get the statistic number of 90% of the high school graduates dont speak well? Remember English is a second language for us so we will have some difficulty with pronunciation but we can communicate in English. I can speak and writte in 3 languages and i have to say is not easy to do so.	0

Our bodies require intake of nutrients, true. But do we need to do it like that? Can't we just let the animal live a happy life, and when it's time to be killed and eaten, how about killing it with respect and painless? We might not be free from the bloodshed, but unlike all other species we actually HAVE equipments to kill a creature without pain.	"How would you propose humans ""nicely and humanly 'kill'"" animals?

you are wrong. the 5.556 is superior to the 7.62, trust me. we are not looking for lethality.	"Isn't the design of a rifle for lethality though? It's a weapon. Now I've heard of the tumbling affect on the 5.56 that can kill, which it could. But a 7.62 is a bigger chunk of lead. For example: when I go deer hunting, I like going out with a 308, which is a similar cartridge to the 7.62. One shot and the deer goes down, either in the heart, lungs, or head. Now with a .22 mag, which is similar to the 5.56, is a great round, I love it! But to knock down a deer, I need to shoot it solely in head or heart, which is harder to hit. I want lethality so the deer doesnt feel any pain. If we design a bullet for a rifle to wound someone, it defeats the purpose. A rifle is ment to kill, and it needs an effective bullet to do so. In your earlier arguement, I noticed that you mentioned, ""Wound one takes out 3."" That is a great plan, but it is not applicable for the modern day. We are fighting terrorists, who believe that dying in battle is a sure way to go to heaven, I think they would want to fight to the death. I doubt they will take the same care to take back a wounded comrade as much as we do. Now I'm not saying everyone single was does. I do appreciate your view on the SMLE though.

Civilian Courts do not have 100 % success rate in convicting terrorists because information is available to the media that can be useful for terrorists, many serious charges are broken down to less serious charges and also, security concerns becomes one of the greates factor. Terrorists (and i am not referring to islamic terrorists) has long been placed for trial before a military tribunal, so what makes these terrorists now different?	I have a suspicion that you cannot name a single piece of information released during a civilian trial that is helpful to terrorists. I would argue even if there is some, that issues like waterboarding, and our military tribunals have been far more useful as a recruitment tool to terrorists than any information which may be divulged in court. The fact is, our military strong-arm tactics make us look bad and creates more of the same problem we are trying to solve. The conviction rate is correct. Not a person named a terrorist has ever had less than life in a SuperMax prison - from which not a person in history has ever escaped. And many terrorists have been executed in civilian court. The two options offer the same results ultimately. These are the differences. 1. In a civilian court, people who are ultimately innocent, like the group of religious dissenters China sent to one of our military prisons, are released sooner and justice is better served. 2. Using civilian courts has just as high a prosecution rate, but cannot be used as a recruitment tool and does not draw the embarassment and ire of our long time allies like Spain, Canada, UK, France, etc. In fact, several of our allies have tried to, and in the case of Nigeria have, accused the Bush administration of war crimes because of our handling of terrorists. It is an embarassment, completely against the spirit of our country, and most of all, has not helped makes us safer - often in fact making us less safe.	0

"How can the uneducated educate? Books. Reading. Curriculum. I taught myself nearly everything I needed to know by reading books. Surely Gypsies can do the same.

I read that link, it was condemning of flexibility. The views of the writer of said link are irrelevant. seeking equality by making one rule for some and another for others is just stupid. So you expect all people to conform to the same ""mould""? Let's say, for instance, that I am a Gypsy. My life and the life of my 'people' have been traveling to and fro for many generations - first in Eastern Europe and now in America - and now, because the government decides that children should go to school, I am expected to change? After hundreds of years, my people would have adapted over the generations to replace such a need. Why should I change for you? Another example: Let's say that I am Amish. I and my 'people' have lived this way for many hundreds of years. Rather than adapting to modern 'conveniences' we have remained as were our ancestors. Now, the fundamentals of my society are being threatened by many different obstacles: laws regarding schooling, insurance, corporal punishment - everything is becoming a threat to us. Why should I have to change? Why can I not continue living as I and my peoples have for generations? We've never done you any wrong. Equality is impossible until all people are treated as equals.

"Haha, I should have specified. Evidence from a credible news source. Newsmax is the least credible news source that can still be considered not a tabloid.

Let me remind you pig that when a lot of this ""evidence"" came out, I was 14 years old, and didn't really watch the news. Therefore I heard very little about the issue of mustard gas. From what I have found, the whole mustard gas thing was very limited, in that there was only a small amount found (correct me if I'm wrong). <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/11/iraq'>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/11/iraq "	it's sort of true. they found a shit load of it stashed in bunkers... not just mortars that were buried... don't know if that was after 2004 though... pretty sure it was around then though. i watched the news since we were attacked though... so i remember a lot of shit that was said. a lot of it was later on reported by Fox News reporters that it wasn't as big a deal, but mustard gas was found in large quantities. i think the one issue with it though is that most of it was not as powerful as when he used to use it. it wasn't only potential though, he was going to do it. he was trying to.  when all the puzzles pieces were put together, it became more than enough of a reason to go in. not just the nuclear program or the WMDs, or even the genocide. the UN resolutions, the past attempts at assassination, the al-Qaeda presence, the constant threats made toward us, combine that with the facts we knew about him, we had to go in. yes, we fucked up on how we did it, but it's better than regretting another 9/11.	0
So living and existing means the same thing ? If that is true, then that is also saying that everything that exist is living since there is no difference.

"Incorrect. The answer is no. This is why the outcomes are ""guilty"" and ""not guilty"", instead of ""guilty"" and ""innocent"". Why is this? They are not measuring his or her innocence. They are measuring the claim of guilt. This is also why the titles ""Prosecution"" and ""Defendant"" are applied, the prosecution is pointing the finger at somebody, providing a claim, placing guilt.

Could it have been solved legally? You do not know this for sure. Perhaps it could have. Almost every other major power did it without starting a war.

When we have less hassles and less miserable people out there, the energy becomes more positive. And in that note, people naturally become happier. Being strong is not needing help. Accepting help when you need it is just being reasonable.	"Are you saying most or even all disabled persons are miserable and a ""hassel""? Not only is that monumentally offensive, it's untrue. If you are basing this on the fact that you would be miserable if you had a disability, then that is a sign of your own weak character but in no way a reflection on others.  There is a lovely little girl who comes to my dog park with her father. She doesn't have a dog, but just comes to play. She has a myriad of disorders, and will have to be cared for her entire life. But, she is happy. Her father is happy. And I could not imagine her ever saying, gosh I wish I had never been born. I happen to think that proportionally, there are more depressed ""normal"" people than disabled. The character of a disabled person is truly amazing, and is probably a direct result of their trials. Being strong is not needing help. No, that's being stubborn and lonely. Again, what's your definition of happiness?"	0

The United states will fracture the customs and fruitful culture of Puerto Rico, they are better off becoming an independent state and keeping their economy from suffering as bad as the United States. They should not become a state for the other reason of WAR it would be another territory to occupy.	Many states have their own rich history and culture. Hawaii and Louisiana are just a two of the states that have vastly different and enriched cultures, and they have both upheld their original traditions, even though they are unified under the United States. Saying that Puerto Rico will lose their unique and wonderful way of life if they were to join us, is far from true. No state in our country has lost its culture by joining the United States. On the fourth day of April Alabama has a legal holiday of Confederate Memorial Day, Hawaii, still celebrates many of it's original holiday's, even Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Day on March 26, and that day goes back to when they were ruled by monarchs, Louisiana, still celebrates Mardi Gras, which is a holiday from back when it was a colony under France's rule, Maine has Patriot Day, and here in Texas we celebrate Battle of the Flowers. These are all things that were unique to the culture before the territory became a state, and that are still in affect today. Therefore saying that Puerto Rico will lose its customs and fruitful culture, like you said they would, is not true. Their culture will be upheld just like the culture of all the other fifty states.	0
The internet is one of the few places where we can still be free. It's through the internet that information is truly accessible. You can find stuff that most other countries ban. Plus, the internet can never truly be censored. It's too large and chaotic. Governments create IP blocks and shit like that, but it only blocks so much. There's a new site every second with the same shit that people want. No matter what, the internet will remain free (unless the world governments find a way to shut it down or block ALL traffic within their borders... fuckin' bastards).	'The internet can never truly be censored'.  Maybe not now but how about in 50 years? That is fallacious because we do not know whether future technologies will be able to censor the internet.  'There's a new site every second with the same shit that people want. No matter what, the internet will remain free' So should governments give up? It's like saying that because a murder takes place every second and because the police cannot conceivably prevent every single one. So the government should just call it quits and allow murders then? The laws that apply to people in real life should apply to them online too. If someone persuades another to kill people via the internet (terrorist cells) then that person is punishable by law. Similarly if sexual content and profanity is deemed harmful to society then such actions must be banned, regardless of the 'impossibility' or scale of such an undertaking.	0

If by that you mean fuzzy photographs, and crop circles.....this is spurious at best. No, humans are responsible for crop circles.

How about many thousands - or is it millions by now? - of 'alien abduction' stories? Human's stories have time and time again proven very unreliable.

Education and science are inherently liberal disciplines. The conservative stance has generally been championing of the common man, using common sense, and other forms of anti-intellectualism. Government spending on public education is simply outrageous, 600 million dollar school in LA, what is that? If Harvard was rebuilt today, it wouldn't even cost that much. The 600 million dollar school in California is a perfect example liberal fiscal policy. Putting kids who can't or won't learn, with incompetent or over-worked teachers, in a fancy building the state can ill afford, will not improve the level of education. Liberal policy=throw more tax dollars at it. Californians, as a whole, deserve what they get from the morons they elect. Just like the rest of us. Cherry picking issues can always make your stance appear supported when in fact it is marginal to the whole picture. WTF. Liberals always cherry pick issues that best suit their ideology. Don't accuse conservatives or libertarians or yourself, communist any different. So obviously to you, regulating businesses means suddenly we all are more regulated and less free... or something. There you go. Now you are getting it. More government = more Control. Government loves control by telling what people to do. It is a fetish.

Go to Isaiah 40:22 it explains that the world was round.

Telling others you will burn in hell forever simply because they don't share your opinions/beliefs is not respect. Beliefs that say everyone else who is not of the same will be tortured forever does not deserve respect, ever!	Nummi, you are just using an example of a disrespectful thing that the religious can say- that is not always necessarily said by all Christians. This is the equivalent of 'atheist beliefs say everyone else who is not Atheist are gullible dumbasses.' - even though this is not always necessarily said by all Atheists.	0
Territorial status is meant to be a transitional step to usher in a permanent status, such as statehood or independence. Made in 1952, the territorial arrangement it was meant to serve as a transitional step to something greater. This current colonial status does not allow Puerto Ricans to vote for the President of the United States. Puerto Ricans do not have representation in the U.S. Senate and no voting representation in Congress. Instead, the 4 million U.S. Citizens of Puerto Rico only have one Resident Commissioner who cannot even vote on the House floor. Therefore, Puerto Ricans have no say in the making of the laws and statutes that apply to them.	If they became a state they would receive all of those things.	0
"I like how you decide to put only negative examples as what can take the place of God. Why not friends, family, love, empathy, or generosity? Do these require a belief in god? Are atheists incapable of these things? I can tell you that, as an atheist, I don't ""worship"" anything. There are certain qualities which I hold in high esteem, and those people which I care about, and even activities that I enjoy doing. None of these things I worship yet they are still a part of my life. I'm sorry but your simplistic view of people fails to take into account the complexity of life."

Yes but the point is that our free will is at fault for evil (according to you), and God is at fault for creating us, therefore god still created a being capable of choosing evil and was therefore creating the possibility for evil. According to you, God is the creator of the universe, nature, which encompasses everything in existence including evil which is an idea used to describe when an action is negative in nature of against a moral code. If God created everything, he is not exempt from being accredited with evil which is the by product of free will. You can't exclude God by placing the blame on his creation, he still created it. If God is responsible for everything in existence, the entire universe, why do you only credit him with the good? If God created everything then he is still the author of evil.	"Consider this: God created us in his own image. That means many things, including our capability to create things (hence the domain name). He gave us a free mind, a free will, and the ability to create. God lives in perfection, creating nothing against himself ""A house divided amongst itself cannot stand."" (Lincoln was quoting scripture when he said that, by the way)  The ability to think and create of our volition. Why would he do that? The answer goes beyond Genesis and into the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus instructs the crowd on the mountain to love their enemies. Challenging them with this revelation (paraphrase): ""If you love those who love you, what have you done? Even the worst sinners do that."" Check it out, we have the choice to do evil things, but the greater moment is when one has the capacity for evil and overcomes it, choosing God over something else. God blessed us with a choice, and gave us the ability to create, as he created. To say that humans cannot create on their own is not even scripturally correct. I'm sure even you believe you can formulate an idea. Those ideas that are not in accordance with the nature of God (in other words, those devices made by man that are wicked in nature) are what encompasses the concept of evil. Yes God created the universe and everything in it, but he also created us with the ability to create. Evil was not his invention, but our own."	0

There are many cases of small scale floods that have crossed over salt and fresh water bodies. Naturally, the two sections remained apart; there is no argument against the infallibility of God's Word here. In fact, there are places in the world today that have a barrier between the salt and fresh water zones of one single standing body of water. As to the side note: Creationists and Intelligent Design theorists do not deny secondary speciation (microevolution). Continued from that: many believe that pangaea was real before the flood. As a result of the flood the continents began to split apart. Moreover, there are two ideas as to how kangaroos and other like animals got to the places that we see them in today. The first is that there was a land bridge after the continents moved. The second is that the intense natural disasters that would have existed for many years after the flood caused the continents to continue moving after partially separating as a result of the flood allowing time for the animals to settle.	not with complete coverage for 40 days.

Your post is a lie. Hes fought hard to get bills passed to get the poorest 50 million healthcare , even those with pre-existing conditions. this is the bets and most moral bill in american history. it was mainly unpopular with the mega rich corporations who own many news networks and used this and their power to destroy the bill. but justice prevailed and obama fought for one of the bravest bills in american history. americans die 10 years younger than some other poorer nations, obama wants to change this. what a phenomenally brave bill to fight for in the midst of the biggest recession in 80 years other unpopular bills include the slow closure of guantanamo bay, the allowance of stem cell research, the saving of the auto industry, the billions of dollars rightly fining of massive corporate corruption, the investment in infrastructure and roads , the nuclear disarmourment programmes etc hes toppled 100s of terrorists and terrorists leaders, hes ended the iraq war and afghanistan to follow hes only raised taxes on the richest americans, which is morally right, especially as the american stock market has doubled in value under obama so corporate profits are up, they should pay more and hes also closed some of the endless tax loopholes for millionaires he HAS created over 5 million jobs in the past 3 years...the debt to gdp ratio has fallen from 3.59 to 3.26 a big fall....hes slashed millitary state spending by 2 trillion compared to the republicans..hes grown the economy steadily for 3 years, hes creatred the majority of new jobs in small to medium businesses...hes delayed debt repayment whilst america grows faster than all of europe , so now its strongf enough to afford some tax rises to pay off debt....hiw quality overseas leadership has meant he will also same trillions on military which will reduce the debts too hes also slashed 500,000 government jobs to create pver 5 million private, so hes also no socialist. hes middle of the road and balanced. unemployment has fallen steadily since bush from 10.5% to 7.7% this has been steady but its all long term with obama his legacy will last a 100 years	Hey I just know what I see and what I see is unemployment is up our debt has quadrupled and 4 Americans where left to die at Benghazi. Yes he gave the order for the seals to kill Osama after the CIA found him but so what that's what he was supposed to do I'm not going to praise his name for saying the right word.

We can run a business just like men. I think it just expands the economic standards for a family.	0
"""You also said the opposite, nice debate skills."" Show me. I don't remember actually changing my stance on that. ""Not exactly relevant."" Relevant in the sense that it outlines the human condition. But yeah, nothing more than that I guess. ""So, you actually believe that everyone goes to Hell no matter what, and you attacked me for saying this, when I didn't actually say it."" I said, ""according to Christians"". I'm not sure what I actually believe anymore, but according to Christianity that view is correct, yes. ""Why the hell would I want to learn about a crazy ass religion that believes that everyone goes to Hell. I see why you left. My original argument was disputing that Satan is the one who condemns people to Hell. As far as I can tell God is the one who does this. Satan doesn't decide who goes to Hell, it is only God."" Well, knowledge for one. I know plenty of atheists who study religion and make it their hobby. They don't believe any of it, but they still study it as one might study a myth or fable. It tends to make their arguments far more effective, as well. As for Satan being a 'warden', that's what I have issues with. Satan is not a warden for anything in the sense that hell is a 'jail'. Perhaps it's my roots in Christianity but eh. I can't really see the logic as to why I decided to argue about it now. I suppose a part of me just felt it was inaccurate, and if you're going to argue for or against something, you should do it accurately."	It sounds like you agree with me that the other guy was wrong about Satan. Sorry about not knowing that Satan doesn't punish people. Apparently he doesn't do anything and yet Christians blame him for it. Show me. I don't remember actually changing my stance on that. I asked you if the rules were made by God. If God chooses who goes to Hell, and if Satan punishes people. You said no, no, and no. How can I clear up my position if you disregard what I say?	0

The first amendment is the right to freedom of religion, not just the right to freedom of choosing our religion. To have the freedom to have religion you need the freedom to not have religion. Let me put it to.you another way. You can buy a soda at the gas station.but they only have sprite, you don't have freedom to have ANY soda but you still have freedom to soda, if you HAVE to have a soda then where is the freedom in that? Freedom OF soda would be the combination of having freedom to any soda and the freedom of whether or not to have soda. I follow what you are saying. You are saying that it is freedom of religion thus you can have any religion, but that doesn't mean you are free to have no religion. I'm saying by only allowing the freedom to have religion, you are not really allowing that person to have truly have freedom of religion, they are forced to have religion. So you can't have freedom of religion without freedom from religion. Otherwise its just forcing someone to have religion.	First of all I want to tell you that I get what you are saying. I truly do but it seems to me like what you are dong is trying to make freedom of religion and freedom from religion be the same thing and to me at least they seem to be entirely different things. To go back to your soda analogy freedom of soda would be like having a refrigerator filled with every kind of soda and you could pick any one you want. Whereas freedom from soda would mean you could chose to have some beverage other than soda. See how the two are different?	0

I think this kind of issue at school it is a little bit awkward, since it must be discuss at home, with family, for some reasons: one, in Brazil there is no professionals qualify to teach this to the students and this requires that the Government spend more money and qualification for those professionals; two, the sex life of any person have to be private and this class could expose the children and teenagers, making them unconfortable with the school envirenment.  Furthermore, this issue could stimulate the premature sex life.	"It does need to be discussed at home, but just because something needs to happen, it does not necessarily means it will. How many households in Brazil have supportive parents willing to hold this kind of difficult conversation with their children? Not many, that is for sure. It is also the school's duty to educate - not to take over the parent's hole, but to aid them. And why would the fact the Government would need to spend money with this kind of important tool to educate our children be an argument against sex education classes? It is not a waste of money, it is money used on what it should be used. And I see no connection between the exposition of the students' sex life and sex education classes. In fact, if nothing, sex education classes are supposed to make children more comfortable with the subject. And I completely disagree with the last point made. As said by Joyce and Daniella, children are exposed to sex all the time, be it in magazines or outdoors. I can assure you that sex education classes will not introduce them to what sex is. These classes are, on the contrary, supposed to educate and prevent against any kind of ill behavior related to sex children might have. They are already exposed to it, might as well educate them.  In order to discuss this issue, it is important to know what is in fact taught in sex education classes. Putting ""sex"" and ""children"" in the same sentence does not need to necessarily mean something bad at all times."	0
I like your argument, up vote. Sports do take up time and can stop those who would otherwise be committing crimes from committing them, but due to the time sports and schools take up. The self-esteem level of a student is not a good indicator of how lily they are to commit a crime, at most it increases their likelihood of drug use which might then cascade into other crimes but as a first cause to crime in general I fail to see the correlation. Most crimes require confidence, a belief in oneself and one's success, in order to be effectively carried out such that they do succeed. A shaky gun hand, a hesitant foot on the accelerator etc would quickly serve as a negative influence on them being criminals. IF anything, low self-esteem decreases the likelihood of committing a crime.  In order to stop a increase in crime schools could promote private substitutes for their sport programs or offer clubs which operate on membership dues.  A sport team which can pay for itself is certainly not one to disappear, especially one which turns a profit. The majority of sports do not raise much revenue though.	I agree with you to a cerain extent. Sports can have its negative influence as well but in fact, in the Juvenile Justice system, sports is a positive pro social activity which is recognized as a combat to deal with risk factors that juveniles are faced with in their lives. It is not sports itself that increases the likelihood of students using drugs, it is the peers that they have in their lives that will act as a negative influence on them using drugs. When students are involved in substance abuse, in most of the cases, they are affected by a) parents who have committed a crime or is incarcerated, substance abuse problems or b) peers who are constantly involved in the use of drugs or engaged in criminal activity. Sports gives students many opportunities to become involved and to give back to their communities. They are able to meet people who can help them to obtain scholarships and educational opportunities which are likely to increase their self esteem and decrease their chances of committing crimes. Thirdly, students with low self esteem has been recognized by Juvenile Courts as a significant risk factor that pertains to young people committing crimes because it may lead to them feeling a loss of committment to their responsiblities or feeling a low chance of success which may attribute to them being involved in crime as a resort to surive in a world where competition for human survival is nothing new.  And for the other arguments you have made i fully support them.	0
Let me just put it in simple terms: anything that results in the death of innocent people is wrong. The Taliban are self-righteous, and have no right to kill, to defy human value. Extremism is never the solution. Let them resort to strikes and other forms of revolution that does not include bloodshed, ther's nothing sinful about that. Whoever they might be, and whatever they might be fighting for, be it something as noble as freedom or something as non-existing or mythical or made-up as jihad, they have no right whatsoever to end human life, or to contaminate the image of Islam.	anything that results in the death of innocent people is wrong. then you may as well say that those ho fought for the freedom of India are not freedom fighters. considering your username you seem Indian. the leaders fought for the freedom of their country, and killed many innocent British.  The Taliban are self-righteous, and have no right to kill, to defy human value they have no right to kill, but nor do the Americans. america killed many innocent for oil in Iraq. Americans too, have no right to kill, or defy human value.  Let them resort to strikes and other forms of revolution that does not include bloodshed, ther's nothing sinful about that this is a kind of strike they are doing, although it involves lots of bloodshed.  Whoever they might be, and whatever they might be fighting for, be it something as noble as freedom  they do not fight for freedom, but for their loved ones who were victims of bombarding and war by the Americans.  they have no right whatsoever to end human life, or to contaminate the image of Islam. no they have no right to end human life, no one does, but when one person does it to them, revenge is a natural feeling.  and they do not contaminate the image of Islam. the only relation of theirs to Islam is that it is most of theirs' religion.	0
He actually made a reasonable point. It's common folk logic that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but that that idea is incomplete. Absence of evidence isn't deductive evidence of absence, but it's actually true that absence of evidence can be inductive evidence of absence. So to be a little less technical this means that if I have searched my room for a diamond the size of a fist for the last couple of years, then I have inductive evidence that there isn't a fist sized diamond in my room. What it doesn't mean is that I can be sure that there isn't such a diamond in my room, i.e. I don't have deductive evidence for the absence of the object. For more than two thousand years we haven't seen reproducible evidence for the existence of God. That amounts to a strong inductive claim that there isn't a God. It doesn't however, mean that we have deductively shown that God doens't exists.  All the confusion we see in these debates arises from the fact that theists believe they have deductive proof that God exists. Deductive proofs inherently out compete inductive proofs, so theists tend to think they have the stronger position. Theists on the other hand haven't ever been able to reproduce their deductive evidence, and that's why atheists are skeptical. Because of the amount of opportunities theists have had to reproduce their evidence, atheists have a strong inductive claim against the existence of God as discussed earlier.	Useless information. Are you going to show me the evidence that makes God non existent or what? So a little less technical this means that if I have searched my room for a diamond the size of a fist for the last couple of years, then I have inductive evidence that there isn't a fistsized diamond in my room. What it doesn't mean is that I can be sure that there isn't such a diamond in my room, i.e. I don't have deductive evidence for the absence of the object. Comparing a diamond to a deity? Idiotic.

Atheists find contradictions within the bibles account of God and claim he doesn't exist. Thats it. Now stop bullshitting and give me some evidence. His argument does not stand as evidence. Even if God didn't say a word does that mean he doesn't exist? No. That is why his claim is bullshit. Stop bullshitting. Give me evidence or I will ban you.	0
Physical pain would likely not harm a god very much. Even if it bleeds, it's not actually human so who knows what it's doing. He was in human form, so it would hurt him as much as any human.	He was in human form, but he still called himself a god. If he had been born human, but due to his sinless and kind nature, he had been chosen later in life due to choices, not fate, to become a god, then I could understand, but he knew the entire time he was God. If he had been born in atheist society, and had thought he was an ordinary man, but wanted to do good and help people, even to the point of sacrificing money, power and his life, that would be more impressive, but he was God, and chose to advertise God. He knew, being God, or just having a connection with God that he would come back to life, or at least go to heaven. Death isn't worth much when you end up coming back to life and then going to heaven. In fact, it's like you never died at all.	0
I live in a society where I can get any education free - elementary, secondary and further, if I want to become a nurse, doctor or whatever. It is not totally free, but almost. This is a of course really good, free education, who doesn't want that? Well, our taxes are high as fuck. I am 17 years old, I earn about 500-1000$ a month, and I pay 40% in taxes. My dad, who earns about 7000$ a month pays 60% in taxes. I am grateful that I go to secondary school totally free, but I would rather have the extra money I pay in taxes.	Ah, but what about someone whose dad makes $2000 a month? Do you believe that only, er 1/10 kids maybe, deserve an education? And how much do you think it would cost you personally to employ several teachers with different expertise for 40 some hours per week?  How much lower would your taxes be if you are still paying for all of the roads, military, infrastructure, etc?  Do you think the say, extra 300 a month you save by not putting any taxes toward school, pay for an education equal to what you are receiving? The fact is that, all through history in every single case, when we share the cost to educate all kids, everyone pays less then they would otherwise (even your dad), and everyone gets a better education.  If you don't believe it look at the U.S. We used to be #1 in everything, everything.  Every year we want to invest less and less because so many think like you, and every year we fall further and further behind.  You're lucky. Take advantage of what you have.	0
"A ""religious reason"" is an inherent oxymoron, as you will never encounter a rational explanation for anything pertaining to religion. What passes as a reason in the religious context is nothing more than simple personal belief. The only religious reason necessary to warrant protection is the existence of a belief against homosexuality. In the U.S. at least, as I believe it should be anywhere, people should be allowed their freedom of religion and that extends to this case as well I think."	"Since when does rational explanation always = reason? The reason is merely an explanation rational or not. It depends on how the word is used within the context If I were to say ""what is your religious reasoning for this?"" then it would be an oxymoron ""What passes as a reason in the religious context is nothing more than simple personal belief.""

Robots can have the intelligence to create better versions of themselves (a 2.0 version) thus letting them evolve and adapt to newer circumstamnces, even if it's an odd way to go about it. That's all well and good, but it is not evolution as we know it. There are no genes, no memes, nothing that is vital for biological evolution. Unless you create something biological, or possibly hybrid, then there is no evolution. And machinery is not biological. As for emotions, they'll have a limited version but while that prohibits them from somethings, it also leads to a greater freedom in choices. No greater than our own freedom of choice. How does having certain choices prohibited lead to a greater freedom of choices? Unless you incorporated some sort of rebellion feature, but I don't know why one would do that. Just out of curiosity, would you treat a racist robot any differently than a racist human? these machines could be their own whole new species Not by the definition of species, which I understand it to be. As far as I'm aware, a species is a group of living organisms subordinate to a genus. Thus, robots do not meet the criteria. And as for why we'd bother with them, it just seems inevitable that our curiosity or even our reliance on machines could lead us to create more and better machines.  I can agree with that. Human curiosity will inevitably lead us to let every single cat out of the bag, no matter what the consequences. And our reliance will probably lead us to endeavour further into robotics, perhaps even sentient. But then again, maybe not. Who knows? Whilst the article is charming, it is not something we can found societies on. I find it hard to believe that robots could be sentient because an 8 year old wants them to be. Quite frankly, I value the opinions of those over the age of 10 to be the most relevant when discussing the philosophy of artificial intelligence.	First I want to apologize for the delay in replying to this. I didn't even know you sent it until I saw it today.  Quite frankly, I value the opinions of those over the age of 10 to be the most relevant when discussing the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Fair enough. Than you should read The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil  Unless you create something biological, or possibly hybrid, then there is no evolution. And machinery is not biological. So if we become the machines than it'll count? That's definitely more than possible. People with Parkinson's disease can gain an artificial machine in their brain that apparently, they consider a part of themselves as it's very helpful with daily requirements. Artificial corneas have been made for the deaf, artificial retinas are being made for the blind, and artificial limbs can be attached to a human that'll give them strength beyond our normal ability.  But how far does it go? Can we keep our humanity if we're ten percent machinery? Twenty? Thirty?	0

"All you have named you eat are primarily sugars/carbs with very little of simple proteins. Also you should check if those ""Doctors"" does sell some vegetarian supplements and who has paid for those ""studies""."	I live in a society where I get free healthcare - that means, that the doctors are not trying to sell stuff .. I get everything free anyways. And those are the doctors who tell me that my heart is better now, than it was 5 months ago - those are the doctors who recommend vegetarian diets to my diabetic sister in law .. see? The people who have diabetes are recommended to live vegetarian by those doctors too. One of the studies I mentioned above was from PETA, so point taken. But I also mentioned some things from a studied made by a beauty and health magazine - they have no intentions of fighting for animal cruelty or anything like that. I know that vegetarians are in greater risk for other diseases, that meat eaters are not. But no matter what diet you chose, you are always in risk of something. And if you look at the statistics, the things most people die of are heart diseases, cancer and diabetes - these three are all in less chance to develop with a vegetarian diet.	0
"God did create marriage because it all started when he created Eve from Adam First of all, start your argument off with proper grammar (""did create""). Second, what does this have to do with marriage? Even if he did exist and he did create Eve from Adam's rib, then how does that have anything to do with marriage? You're not proving anything, you're only stating what you believe happened. By the way, how do you know a man up in the sky created a woman from a man's rib, is there any way you can prove to me that this happened without using the Bible as a source? God has to be the third member of a marriage or it will crumble. This statement is not true at all. Plenty of non-religious, athiest, agnostic and others not worshiping a deity have had successful and long-lasting marriages. There is no third member of a marriage unless you're a polygamist, either. Explain to me how your God, over any other God, is a part of everyone's marriage and how if you don't invite him between you and your wife that your marriage will crumble. Also, God does exist because he created the world and he created humans You are not proving anything, you are not providing any logical explanation for this. God exists because he created the world and humans? Does the Stay-Puft Marshmallowman exist because he was in Ghostbusters? No, we know he doesn't exist because he's a fictional character in a story and doesn't exist outside of fiction. Does God exist because he created humans and the world? He technically didn't create humans as we naturally evolved from our predecessors to be the way we are, and not just in a split second by some God. We also know through science that the world wasn't created in seven days by a God either. So, how does your God exist? Please explain using proper facts and evidence or else your claim is dismissed as false. how is he not worthy of worship? What has God done to deserve any less God hasn't done anything to anyone at all. People spend countless hours praying to nothing, only to have nothing happen at all. What has he done, you cannot attempt to prove that he's done anything without the use of the Bible as evidence, which it is not. In short, your brief ""rebuttal"" was a weak attempt to prove you're right and a strong attempt to prove you're mildly insane."	So I can't use my bible as a resource but you can use Darwin's book as a resource to throw evolution at me how is that fair. God is like love it's just there you can't see love but you just know its there.	0
Pardon me if I'm suffering from lunatic right-wing retardedness, but these supposed leaders actually do NOT spend most of their time trying to support education in the lower class urban areas. Instead, they play to their lowest base instincts of racism and envy and encourage them to blame others for their lack of fortune of success rather than harbor an attitude of anything is possible if you work hard, learn, and achieve. It's why we see so many welfare families having children they can't afford as a way to increase their government checks, and then turn the kids out to the streets where many join gangs to find some semblance of family and acceptance. And it goes on from generation to generation, and is embraced by the democratic party, IMO.	"Your opinion is absolutely ridiculous.  1. Slavemasters owned humans and beat them with whips and didn't let them vote and sold them like property. Your comparison is ""retarded"" as stated. 2. You cannot name a single time any of the people you mentioned have ever supported any policy that encourages kids to join gangs, stay on welfare, or any of the other ridiculous things you mention. 3. If they are encouraging blacks to go on welfare, why are so many more white people on welfare? Who's encouraging them? 4. Welfare sucks. No one wants to be on it and those who are generally get off of it fairly quickly. You act as if people are just staying on it because it's a great life. Someone is going to take advantage of anything you put in place, but that is a low low minority. The vast majority on welfare need it and they get off it when they can. 5. Welfare is a boon both for our economy and for quality of life overall for everyone, whether you ever need it or not. It allows children to be fed and educated who otherwise couldn't be, most don't join gangs, most go on to contribute to society and less could have had it not been for the help provided by these programs. You are demonizing a group of people you obviously know nothing about. It's right wing paranoia at its worst and victimizing victims."	0
"I'm a theist whom does not go to church and so who's leading me? No one, I am leading myself and figuring out what the hell is going on by my self, currently. Sure there was a time when I was younger, however, it's like you're saying no matter if I'm in church or not that I am being ""lead"" by a group of people.  I could say the same to an atheist. They don't go to church, and you claim have ""no leaders', however it's obviously that many atheists look up to and learn a lot from other atheists, whomever they be, thus resulting in atheists having at least SOME form of organization. Atheists aren't running around individually with no agenda in mind, they obviously wish to proclaim to the world that there is in fact no god(s), ever. And so, think of the teachers and the schoolbooks that teach particular things that are not religious and that are atheistic. That is, most atheists believe not in the bible or any other religious texts, but scientific textbooks, seminars, literature, whatever. There is organization written all of it, that is undeniable and don't even try.  Just face it, atheists are organized to a degree, and it's obvious that religion in general, is organized.  Every person falls into a category, we're all a part of the societal organization and cultural entity.  (P.S. Yeah, when I drink I tend to enjoy saying/typing the word ""FUCK"". I can type 80 WPM and when I'm going it just comes out. Don't mind that...)"	You're a theist being led by your god. Although many atheists look up to other atheists and or scientists who changed their minds, they look up to them to the extent that they would admire a celebrity. If having an idol puts you in a religion then the line will never be drawn. As for lack of atheist leaders, it's true. With no formal organization there is no official name to call anyone one who might be leading a group of atheists, that simply pick titles based on the roles they'll play in their group. The religions that are being lead by a leader, have ministers, deacons, and at the very top of the chart, their god. You said atheists want to make the world all atheist and that that acts as their agenda. I disagree with this not only because I don't wish to spread atheism, but also because none of my atheist friends wish to. We don't seek to gain anything by being atheists we just disbelieve god because of a lack of evidence. The ones that do try to persuade others are just trying to share their opinion are usually the debaters, who enjoy conflict. Where as most religions have laws dictating the spread of their religion. You say that if atheism is a religion their religious texts would be science books and seminars. That is only true of the overly scientific atheists. Other atheists choose not to believe god exists because of a lack of proof, but take regular proven science as proven facts, no more no less. It's a stereotype that all atheists are scientific. Atheists are organized, they do have their meetings that center around their topic, but it's no requirement. As for drinking and arguing. it seems like a bad idea to me but i rarely judge. I didn't mind so much, I assumed you were really passionate about the topic.	0

I read your argument. I disagreed with the validity of the source, and said that I don't consider it a valid argument. As we disagree, I'm pretty sure we're both going to stop, we've reached a standpoint. I wasn't telling you what to do. There's a difference between an order and advice.	I have heard many people like you giving me advice and saying that I should not be quoting the Bible. I am tired of it. It is getting annoying. I will continue to quote the Bible no matter how many times you keep saying it and so nothing is going to stop me from quoting the Bible	0
Well if the supernatural was evident it wouldn't be unreasonable however if on the highly improbable chance that our unjustified lucky guess about the existence of the supernatural is true, the supernatural would most likely be interdimensional or beyond the universe or something like that which would require us to be highly advanced. So a reasonable religion (though incredibly unlikely) is possible.	"The supernatural is unreasonable because it is defying logic, physics, and reason. Therfore any religion is then automatically unreasonable. And why do you say ""OUR unjustified lucky guess about the existence of the supernatural""? I'm making no such guess. In fact all my bets are on that it is NOT real/true. And you then you attempted to give the supernatural a scientific hypothesis as to what it might be. But the supernatural by definition defies physics, science, logic, ect. It's not a matter of us not being advanced enough to detect/test it, it's that it's literally opposite of how everything works and is therfore pretty much 100% false.  A reasonable religon isn't possible. It's dependent upon supernatural entities/forces which cannot coexist with what we know about the universe."	0
I don't think America has any culture of it's own. English came from the British, some of the declared favorite foods of Americans came from other places. Hamburgers: German Pizza: Italian Hotdogs: Also german. Even the country was made by people from Africa.	Major food...Turkey. Native to America. Peanut Butter. Ice Cream. Time Zones were created by us. We also probably have the most headstrong government in existence. We touched the moon first. We made Facebook. We made the Xbox 360. We made modern baseball. We used the first and only nuke on another country. I believe we invented the internet. We invented roller skates. We performed the first oil drilling. We made the telephone. We made the microwave oven. We made the segway which is that two wheeled thing people drive and stand on. We made the bionic eye lens. We made the machine gun. We made a smoke detector and we made the ferries wheel. We made the assembly line. We made the tractor. I can go on and on about all the things we made. America has culture. It may be the child to Great Britain but we formed our own nation and we have made a culture for ourselves.	0

All of the above support more access to better education for poor people, who happen to be concentrated in urban areas. The idea they do not want people educated is lunatic right-wing retardedness.	"The idea they do not want people educated is lunatic right-wing retardedness. Right wingers never said ""we don't want educated people!"" they just said ""get government out of education and allow for the market to take over, the true competition will drive quality up and prices down, then education gets better."" Wanting to force people to pay for state education with low quality teachers and indoctrinating history classes is retarded."	0
"> I don't know of any atheists who claim Jesus told them to handle poisonous snakes before dying from a snake bite. Weren't the ""Heavens Gate"" suicide cult atheists? They drank poison on the belief that a passing UFO was going to beam them up; but that their physical bodies were preventing their teleportation. I don't know that anyone's skeptical inquiry led them to make themselves a religious martyr and blow themselves up in a crowded area. Weren't the Tamil Tigers, responsible for more suicide bombings that Islamic extremists, also atheists? While their goal may have been National Socialism, according to Wikipedia they were also atheists. I'm not trying to case atheism into a negative light; but given that atheism does not possess a doctrinal system, there's no reason to suppose that atheist are immune to the violent excess that we've seen in religion. Atheists simply have less motivation to engage in some acts. Furthermore, atheism is simply the lack of belief in deities. Skeptical inquiry is not at all associated with atheism because to suggest so would be to imply that atheism has some form of dogma. While individual atheists may indeed be critical thinkers. I disagree strongly with implying that you cannot be an atheist unless you are a critical thinker/skeptic. You're not doubt familiar with the concept of ""apathism"". An apathist might indeed be an atheist; but I'd not be inclined to say that they are atheists by way of skeptical inquiry."	"Weren't the ""Heavens Gate"" suicide cult atheists? Not even close. Heavily religious. You really shouldn't need me to tell you this; you have a computer, any superficial research you do into the Heavens Gate cult will reveal it's strong ties to Christian scripture and New Age ritual. And as a part of their religious adherence, some of them mutilated their genitalia, which was something I mentioned the religious are notoriously fond of doing.  Weren't the Tamil Tigers, responsible for more suicide bombings that Islamic extremists, also atheists? The Tamil Tigers we're not particularly motivated by their religious beliefs, but they were not motivated by a lack of belief in god, either, which is what atheism is. When religious fanatics blow themselves up, they're doing it in the name of god and as a direct result of their religious teachings. When someone who happens to be an atheist blows themselves up (like the Tamil Tigers) they're not doing it because of their atheism, they're doing it because they are motivated by political, ethnic (etc.) reasons. So what if they happened to be atheists? Atheism would have had to have been a primary motivating factor in the suicide bombings in order for it to be relevant, and it quite simply wasn't.  but given that atheism does not possess a doctrinal system, there's no reason to suppose that atheist are immune to the violent excess that we've seen in religion. If it did posses a doctrinal system there would be reason to suppose that they would be immune to the violent excess that we've seen in those that posses a doctrinal system?  I think you need to rethink that one and try again, buddy, because that doesn't make one lick of rational sense.  To address what I think you're trying to say, here, I never implied that atheists were immune to violent excess.  Atheists simply have less motivation to engage in some acts. Exactly. Which means atheists are less prone to engage in such acts, which is the point I already made.  Skeptical inquiry is not at all associated with atheism because to suggest so would be to imply that atheism has some form of dogma. Why does that mean atheism has to have some form of dogma? It seems to me in order to arrive that the philosophical conclusion that god doesn't exist, which is what atheism asserts, some manner of thinking and/or questioning must have occurred, which is all that skeptical inquiry means.   While individual atheists may indeed be critical thinkers. I disagree strongly with implying that you cannot be an atheist unless you are a critical thinker/skeptic. First of all, where the hell did I imply that? Really. Please. Point it out.  Secondly, you seem to have two entirely different terms confused for the same thing. One is ""skeptical inquiry"" which means uncertain questioning, or doubtful examination. The other is ""critical thinker"" which is basically a reference to someone who thinks skillfully. You can be the most skeptical inquirer on the face of the planet and not be a critical thinker. So when I call atheists ""skeptics,"" it's because that's what I think they are; that's part of being an atheist. That does nothing to say anything at all about their critical thinking skills. You pulled that one out your ass.  This isn't a quote of yours but the stuff below is REALLY IMPORTANT and you've already shown you have a habit of ignoring parts of my posts so I wanted to catch your attention. So read, please: Why did you ignore 4/5th of my post (the part where I address, dispute, and refute the various aspects of this debate and your position in it) in favor of only talking about 1/5th of my post (the part where I debate some minor semantics)? From where I'm sitting, it seems like you can't defend the bulk of your argument and position so you're ignoring it and instead only addressing small, nit-picky things you think you can handle. Speculation, I admit, but what am I supposed to think?"	0
The economy is way down in the crapper. First of all, even if you do tax the rich to the point they become poor the economy will still be in the crapper. What needs to happen is the Afghanistan War needs to be wrapped up (should be by 2014) and defense spending cut back.  That alone will take out a huge chunk of spending. Next the government needs to stop sending aid to foreign countries that are clearly are not the best of friends with us. We should confirm our allies and then leave the rest alone. To make a long story short, we should stop acting like world police and take care of ourselves and maybe the few loyal allies we have.	"The economy is way down in the crapper. Do you think that the wealthy are currently paying a ""higher"" tax rate?"	0
Atheism as a belief does not support the notion of morals. It does allow for ethics, the interpretation of morals. However, while both individuals who are religious and irreligious can act with morality, their actions can ultimately be analyzed according to a fundamental moral standard, and as such they cannot claim to follow their own moral code.	"What do you mean by a ""fundamental moral standard""?  Why can such a standard not be individualized?"	0
I would have to say home school because then children aren't exposed to the bad behavior I've dealt with in school and it would be specialized. I'm not saying taught by the parents though, I'm saying tutors or online. It's so much better and more rewarding towards the eduction to the child. And I don't want the bad teachers that can't keep their opinions to themselves to brainwash any child. I want my children to get all the facts, without an outer opinion, so they can make their own mind on everything. I'm not going to force my anit-religion persona on my children, but I will give them all the facts from each side.	"I would have to say home school because then children aren't exposed to the bad behavior I've dealt with in school and it would be specialized. Education isn't simply an academic process. Its pedagogy entails the proper raising of ""good citizens"" - in whatever manner that is defined. That education requires that people aren't raised to be naive: that they encountered wonders and villainy, have screwed up, and simply done all the correspondingly stupid nonsense that we normally associate with youth while they're actually young, can be protected and guided as properly as possible, inasmuch as anyone can. And having screwed up,and done all the correspondingly stupid things that we normally associate with youth, they can grow up. But growing requires those kinds of experiences: digesting and ultimately surmounting them. Keeping children away from ""bad behavior"" often does leave them unprepared for an adulthood that will see them absolutely inundated with that kind of behavior at almost every turn. There's a reason why little girls who are overprotected by their fathers often end up becoming whores. They don't know how to appropriately deal with the stimuli that life presents. And when they finally encounter it, they get turned out. And I don't want the bad teachers that can't keep their opinions to themselves to brainwash any child. When one is educated, one tends to have opinions on things. But, to suggest that you just want your children to learn facts would ultimately undermine them. For example, Robert Francoise Damien was executed for trying to assassinate the King of France. That's a fact. But that fact alone tells your child nothing about why the death of Damien represents a contradiction of the Enlightenment. It also doesn't educate your child as to why the contradictions of the Enlightenment are an important lesson to learn. And your child will be ill-served, because many of those contradictions are present in modern society, and we need people who are able to analyze issues contextually so as to solve them. Your child would be less able to provide adequate solutions to human problems because all they got was a bunch of dates, names of people and other irrelevant stuff in school. On a tangential point: all education is brainwashing or indoctrination. There is no difference. We educators give students information and punish them in various ways for not accepting that information. Having been punished academically, many of those students will then go on to be ostracized by society as whole. So, we make sure that they know everything we want them to know in the service of our needs. And we make damn certain that they think everything else is morally and intellectually wrong. A well educated person is simply someone who has been increasingly brainwashed over time, and in fewer, more concentrated subjects."	0
Why is martial art an oxymoron and self defence art not? If it -ceases to be- that war, by definition involves willfully causing harm to people, despite there being artful and elegant alternatives. Then I would stop thinking of it as an oxymoron. My opinion is that brutality and violence cannot be rightly considered art. If you disagree please explain why.	My view is that the great martial artists are as skilled and graceful as any ballet dancer, Chinese Opera training starts with martial arts because it increases flexibility etc they might use those skills in the theatre but they are still fighting skills - martial skills - skills that translate to art - martial art. Please explain what graceful and elegant alternatives you would use to combat someone attacking you which do not resort to violence. Assuming the time for talk has passed and they have already attacked.	0

Ok, time to add my point i guess. These are all great points so far, as to why science is of the higher value, because as has been said, it is a value of its own. But how does one come to understand it? To use it? To comprehend it to others? Literature is the answer to all 3 of these questions. By even adding our points on this webpage, we have used a form of literature. If this were a live debate, we'd be speaking; another form of literature. We need to face the fact that Literature is used for a major part of our lives! Literature has given us the ability to read, write and learn, because how can the message of learning be passed without the use of literature? Now, we can admit that science has done wonderous things, it has led to the discover of the world's wonders, as well as the craetion of man's greatest inventions. I need not even say it, because my point should already clear. Literature has done all of this, because every invention began on paper and every discovery needed description, notes, etc.  How could we pass on valuable information? How could we learn valuable information? How we understand valuable information when we see it? It all begins with Literature, as it is the cornerstone of understanding.	"First of all literature is the written word, that is novels, plays, essays, histories, biographies, etcetera. Literature is an important facet of most modern cultures but it is not necessary. You claim that all scientific discovery requires literacy, frankly this is not true. Scientific discourse began long before writing was invented. In fact one might argue that science, religion, and philosophy are integral to the human condition: man has always asked the difficult question of ""why?"" and as a species we show no inclination to stop. From this central conclusion we can deduce that literature is not necessary for science to occur because if science is a universal constant among humans then the fact that not all cultures have literature requires that science be independent of literature. Further literature has always and always will depend on science to provide it with the changes in culture and thought process that allow writers to create new works from new perspectives.  Does this diminish literature's value? No, literature is relevant to society in that it gives a perspective on ourselves, who we are and what we were. It gives us a means to record information more reliably than through an oral tradition. But science allowed literature to exist through the invention of writing materials and to make claims otherwise is both misleading and dishonest."	0
I would say it is. Human's have a measure of free will, which if you believe in Christianity is God given. If you believe, it will look like a viable argument for you. If you don't, it will look like a logic circle. Same with the reverse. As with most religion debates, people will see what they want to see.	"To quote Christopher Hitchens... "" I believe in irony. I say that we do have free will, because we have no choice. But the theist says that we have free will because the boss told us we have to have it"". Belief does not alter the laws of logic. A circle cannot be square, 2+2 cannot be 5, and free will cannot be dictated. These are all independent of belief."	0

"ok mr pedant obama helped create 5 million plus private jobs No he didn't. That whole 5 million+ jobs is from Keynesian multiplier which has been totally discredited.  the most vital economic improvement of all....he helpes america grow at a faster rate than any european nation... He didn't really ""help"" us grow to at a rate. In case you haven't looked at Europe, its first on the chopping block for economic collapse. PS: Russia's economy is expanding faster than ours. There is such a thing as gun control , many guns are banned and many checks are in place, clearly they all must be tightened up and all military style assault weapons must be banned. Military assault weapon is a meaningless term. Two guns can have the exact same clip size, firing rate and action type but one will be illegal and one won't purely because of the way they look. Its based on appearance, not the actual gun itself.  And you there is no such thing as gun control, just changing who has them. You need guns to confiscate guns and you need guns to enforce the gun control laws. There will still be guns, just not in the hands of average, law-abiding citizens.  romney wanted bigger government with regards military and 2 trillion more government spending on military? in a recession? with 16 trillion debts he wanted to spend more money on war? he didnt have a clue where to find it... I don't support Romney, I never did. Romney and Obama's policies are shockingly similar.  the US already has a military bigger than the next 10 biggest countries combined.  Yes, America has the largest Military budget in the world (with veterans benefits and foreign aid included. The current wars make up about 20% of it) but even if you cut the ENTIRE military, the budget would still be unbalanced. And Obama keeps on increasing spending."	0

"ignore what Kuklapolitan said, there was more than one reason for going into Iraq... i don't see why people always have to say ""was it this, or this"", it was a longer process than just ""WMDs or al-Qaeda"". here was the fact, Saddam was trying to get uranium, he had even told a reporter that he was planning on restarting his nuclear program, we already knew that he had chemical WMDs, he had violated a shit load of UN resolutions, had al-Qaeda forces in Iraq (we all remember the major al-Qaeda leader al-Zarqawi who was there way before we entered). Hell, him committing genocide was the least of OUR problems, but it sure as hell was another factor that was added for our attack."	Iraq did a lot of things wrong, and Saddam Hussein was a bastard...no one is denying that. However, Al Qaeda's presence in Iraq, and the WMD's (which are mysteriously missing), or his attempts to get Uranium, or any of the other reasons that were presented to the American people (or in some cases hidden from) were enough reason to go attack a country that posed little to no immediate threat, and then continue to occupy it. Half a million Iraqis have died! Does that mean anything? If they were breaking U.N. resolutions then it is the U.N's responsibility to take action, not the U.S.'s to act like the international police force.	0

And you can't stop me so I don't know why you continue to say thing like keep it to yourself and all that other stuff.   You are forcing your idiotic bullshit onto others by saying they will absolutely burn in hell that doesn't even exist, because their opinions differ - not respectful at all. I do correct myself and I don't need someone like you to correct me because you have your own problems and I have my own but I don't need correction from an atheist who hasn't been saved and has more problems then I do I am not forcing anything upon anyone its their decision if they want to hear about Christ or learn about Him. If they tell me they don't want to then I move on to the next person.  Like not being open to what I have to say and your close-minded and don't want to listen. I listen to your stuff even if it is crap that you spew or something I disagree with. And yet you don't take the time to listen what my beliefs had to say. It has to work both ways not just your way of things.  That's because I don't believe anything, for one. And also, what I say is not nonsense unless spewing nonsense was my intent all along, and it's not Yes you do believe in something its called athiesm a lack of belief in God. You also believe in secular humanism where man is the source of all cause which is flawed because we didn't create everything like for example this earth or the people in it.  Exactly what I was referring to - nonsense. And not just, but nonsense you think actually is real and as such you absolutely believe people who differ in mind will be tortured forever. Not only disrespectful but you are also a bad person. That's your opinion of what kind of person I am but I am just going to shrug it off because I don't really care what you insult me about.	"When I say something, insulting someone never comes to mind, unless it is obvious that the opponent might take it that way. But why should I care? Why should I lie and keep myself back because someone doesn't like what I have to say, even though it is concluded from their own opinions? If you don't like something I say, if that something reflects reality, then it is your problem, not mine. I am sorry but I can't keep it to myself I am suppose to tell everyone about my beliefs and share it so that everyone will have an opportunity to hear about Jesus. By raving lunacy? Why should anyone listen to delusions? Why should anyone listen to someone insane? Delusions, insanity, and stupidity require criticism, and always will. How else are people like you supposed to learn? If so very many point out your flaws, something, eventually, should get through and should stir a speck of sanity from somewhere deep within. And you can't stop me so I don't know why you continue to say thing like keep it to yourself and all that other stuff. Of course I can't (actually, it's wouldn't...) stop you, it's something you have to do yourself. I do correct myself and I don't need someone like you to correct me because you have your own problems and I have my own but I don't need correction from an atheist who hasn't been saved and has more problems then I do Exactly what I was talking about - forcing your crap onto others as if it is real. It's not real. You do not correct yourself, because you're still insane. You still take fantasy as reality. And so, every bit you say that goes against reality needs criticism. An atheist? I don't call myself one. Hasn't been saved? From what? From some fantastical stuff you take as real? Not real, is made up. There's no saving anybody, including yourself, because it all is made up. I have more problems than you? In what way exactly? I'm not the one whose mind is a mess. I am not forcing anything upon anyone its their decision if they want to hear about Christ or learn about Him. Saying if you do not embrace this and that you will suffer, will be tortured, forever is forcing your crap onto others. It is forcing because what you say includes threats. It is a threat! Take in parallel someone threatening a person with death if that person doesn't do something. This is exactly the same, simply one minor difference - instead of an actual possibility of going through with the threat, if ignored or not done, there isn't one. So it's an empty threat, but one nonetheless. So, next time you say something like what you have so many times, think first a little bit. If they tell me they don't want to then I move on to the next person. How about not saying anything at all? How about not shoving your nonsense onto others in the first place? You saying those things is the same as quoting any fantasy story ever written, or anything based off of those stories. It is exactly the same. Like not being open to what I have to say and your close-minded and don't want to listen. I am very open, but I don't listen to nonsense. Why should I? None of the things you've said make sense, they can't, and can't because they're not based on reality. You are the one closed-minded. You have been showed flaws in the things you take as real so many times and in so many ways, and you still take that same fantasy as reality. When you say someone is closed-minded you should really first look at yourself. I listen to your stuff even if it is crap that you spew or something I disagree with. I don't spew crap, you do. You take mine as crap because unlike yours mine is based on reality. The only reason (or just the main reason...). And yet you don't take the time to listen what my beliefs had to say. They say nothing! Honestly, if I want to hear some fantasy stuff I'll just read a fantasy book. It has to work both ways not just your way of things. For it to work both ways both sides must be open, you are not open. If you were open you'd have realized long ago that your beliefs are nonsense, and because of that you'd have corrected yourself. Yes you do believe in something its called athiesm a lack of belief in God. Wrong. I do not believe in anything. Atheism is the lack of belief in a god, it does not require belief. Anyway, I don't call myself an atheist. The only connection with atheism I have is that I fall under its definition by having no belief in any gods. ""Lack of belief"" means ""unbelief"". You're not good with understanding context, are you? In the phrase ""lack of belief"" you have to take all those three words together as one to understand what is meant by them. You also believe in secular humanism where man is the source of all cause which is flawed because we didn't create everything like for example this earth or the people in it. I don't believe in it. I don't believe in anything, as I've said many times elsewhere also. All opinions I have I have come up with on my own. In fact, when I read ""secular humanism"" I had to recheck what exactly it means to know what you meant by it. And while at it I realized that you don't know what it means either... I don't need nor want any preconceived ideas to form opinions. And if I do confront some I always look at them critically. That's your opinion of what kind of person I am but I am just going to shrug it off because I don't really care what you insult me about. That wasn't an insult."	0

Okay, I mean it's pretty straightforward. This policy leads to a high rate of infanticide and abandonment, for one thing.

After watching the blown calls in the Saints-Packers game, the NFL Referees are just as good or bad as the replacements, so there is no difference between the two.	I understand there were some bad calls in that game...and its easy to think after your team suffers two consecutive bad officiating games that the real refs are not much better than the replacements. However, I can't remember any other three week stretch of officiating that was as atrocious as week 1-3 of the replacement refs. So rest easy Packers fan, the officiating will not continue to be this bad now that the real refs are in. Oh...Go Bears!	0

"I don't mind using the argument of ""evil existing"" to argue against the validity of a Christian or Islamic God. At the same time, arguing against an entire religion requires much more than just ""why is there evil?"" many priests are taught from the beginning to answer with intellectually dishonest bullshit, but at the same time, it's bullshit that is almost impossible to argue against with mere ""why does evil exist"" rational. you need to understand a religion and understand WHY faith is evident in order to be able to start your argument against it all. You have to know so much about it that if you were explaining it to someone, they would at first think that you are a believer. But for the basic idea of God or a deity, saying that ""a deity doesn't exist because evil exists"" is a fallacy. Nothing to it."	"The argument from evil doesn't pretend to be able to defeat every tenet of the Christian religion - or every tenet of any other religion, for that matter. It only critiques one thing: the concept of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being (a being whose existence espoused by a number of schools of theological thought), arguing that the existence of such a being would be inconsistent with known facts about the world. In this respect, it is the same as pretty much any other argument concerning the concept ""God"". Let me ask it this way: Why is it a fallacy to say that an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being cannot exist if evil exists and to provide supporting arguments? What makes such an argument a fallacy, other than the fact that you can't really know what something (e.g. God) is like? And if this fact is all that you're basing your claim of fallacy on, would you then say that every other argument that falls prey to this is also a fallacy? Would it be a fallacy for me to argue that children should eat their vegetables for the sake of their health, because I can't really know that vegetables are good for their health?"	0

There's a silly stigma against pot, and a rally filled with a bunch of people that actually smoke it is just gonna get people more up in arms about it in a negative way. The fact is, there aren't enough people that think clearly in this country, and not because too many are drug-addled, but because too many are prejudiced without even getting to the stuff or the people that smoke, have bad morals that are against smoking a plant but for killing in God's name, or are just plain apathetic about change even without smoking.	0

Right now, the way the question is posed and in this time, I think it'd actually be best to make cigarettes illegal.

Well, no we shouldn't. But I'm trying to narrow it down to what specific literature you have in mind and it feels like you plugged in the word literature when you're actually thinking about the bible. Correct me if I'm wrong. Because otherwise, literature and science are two different things. Granted, a really good writer could write an awesome piece of literature about something scientific, because most books do have truth to them, and some do have science within them. But science is valuable itself, although harder to comprehend and requires actual interest to bother with it.	"Actually, now that i notice, you mentioned that science is ""harder to comprehend"", so that is where Literature comes into play, because it is, as i have said, the cornerstone of understanding."	0

Also, your claim that it is human nature to search for god is unsubstantiated, and I don't believe it.

"as someone who enjoys nudes and swearing, I would hate the elimination of censorship in PRIMETIME because it would take all the fun out of it. Porn get less and less exciting as it is because there is so much sex everywhere. Imagine if sex was on tv ALL THE TIME... porn would just be... penetration. we'll be desensitized.  as for swearing, swear words are powerful because of their ""bad word"" status. Once they become mainstream and acceptable, they'll be just as effective as freakin' or shoot."	"Take all the fun out of it? How? You're the same person! If you like it and see it so much, you think you'd have been desensitized to it before. So you enjoy the porn due to the excitement? If all it becomes in the future is... penetration, then so what? Who cares? It is a natural act, but I'm getting off course, here. This is about nudity and swearing, not sex. I understand why the bad words are so powerful, but, I mean, if we go by your system, how long is this going to take?

"You are not ""Christianity"" Your original idiotic argument didn't say it was based on ""your own little idea of what Christianity is""! Define Christian: A person who believes in Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit. All the other stuff don't matter. I didn't say it was, but it isn't the whole of what Christianity is based on. Christianity is based on EVERYTHING from both testaments! Yes, you actually did. Go back and take a look. I know Christianity isn't JUST the old. But it is based on the new.. not the old. Hahaha! So stupid! If the old testament didn't exist, then the new couldn't either thus the whole damn thing would be one big lie, which of course it is. Read my argument again. I said: Christians believe in both testaments, but if the new testament didn't exist, then Christianity wouldn't exist either. Because if the new testament didn't exist, Jesus wouldn't exist, or his story wasn't told. I said if the NEW testament didn't exist, then Christianity wouldn't exist. Because Christianity is based on the new testament. Because what Christianity is based on is Jesus - no other religion believes in Jesus. If the new testament didn't exist, Jesus wouldn't exist, and Christians wouldn't exist. Christian would be Jews - because only the old testament would exist, and Jews believe in the old testament. why do you think Jews only believe in the old testament? Because they don't believe in Jesus. Bullshit. Why are you such a hateful, miserable person? Is this how your Jesus wants you to behave? Pathetic. No he doesn't, I want to be. Jesus gives us freedom to behave the way we want to."	Yes, you actually did. Go back and take a look. No! You're completely wrong, as usual.	0
I think that's it. I'm not so interested in legalizing polygamy, I am not against it, but I am certainly not gonna fight for it. I fight for homosexuals, not polygamists. But if and when polygamists are going to be able to marry several people, then I don't think there is any need to legalize anything further. People mention necrophilia and bestiality. But I think when it comes to marriage, the love has to go both ways. There has to be two sides who love each other. With necrophilia the love goes only one way, and the same with bestiality. One can probably claim that his dogs truly loves him - but the dog can not speak for himself, and I don't think it is anyone's right to speak up for him, when they don't know exactly what he is saying.	"I agree love has to go both ways. So, I can't defend necrophilia (well, maybe I could; but it would get way too meta physical); but I can defend, well at least pose an argument, that love can go both ways between an animal and a human.  DISCLAIMER: I am not advocating bestiality. I am offering a logical argument disputing the statement ""...love goes only one way ...with bestiality"" and ""...the dog can not speak for himself..."". I am going to use the hypothetical scenario you used i.e. a man and a dog. {(A beautiful golden retriever named Sandy, with lushes flowing hair, mmmmhh... but I digress) that was humor so people don't take this so seriously, but look at the logic of the argument} okay. Any good pet owner who truly loves their pet (platonically, not trying to trap anyone) cannot deny that there grows a bond between the animal and themselves. It is accepted that humans can love their pets. I claim that a dogs feelings for a human can also be categorized as love. There have been innumerable instances of dogs throwing themselves into highly dangerous, if not outright suicidal situations, in order to try and protect their human companions. If risking your life for someone else isn't love, than I don't know what is.  So, i claim that establishes that love can exist between a dog and a man. This leads us to sexual desire. I'm sure a lot of you would say, ""yeah I love my dog, but I don't wanna boink her.""  However, there are some people who do want to have sex with their dogs. Critics will say that that sexual desire is wrong, because they can't understand it. I don't understand homosexual desires. NOTE: I am not comparing the two sexual desires. I am making a point that just because you don't understand a sexual desire does not make it wrong.  So, I have established; 1. Love can go both ways between a dog and a man, 2. Sexual desire for an animal is not necessarily wrong. This brings us to; does the dog have sexual desire for the human? This I think can be established with a simple empirical experiment. If a man can have sex with an unrestrained dog, without the dog running off, or attacking, or showing distress; I think that proves the dog's sexual desire for the man.  Now to ""...the dog can not speak for himself..."" Clearly the dog doesn't posses the ability to express his thoughts through any spoken human language. Consider; when you reach for a dogs food bowl while she is eating and he nips your hand or you get home from work and your dog runs up and licks your face, are these not ways in which a dog expresses her thoughts/feelings, or a way in which the dog speaks for herself.  In summary: love can go both ways between dog and human, there is a way to establish sexual desire between the two, and dogs can speak for their selves, just not in words; therefore a romantic union between animal and human is valid.  ONCE AGAIN: I am not advocating bestiality.  (gotta be careful around here)"	0
"How in the hell do you KNOW? neither I nor you nor the pope nor the smartest scientist KNOWS the truth behind the world, god, the universe ect. Calm down man this is a friendly debate no need to get all angry at me. God knows the truth behind the world and everything because He is the one who made the universe and everything in it. No human being can know every single feature and why it does it. There will be many theories of how life came to be and how the universe came to be but they will always leave God out of it because they don't want Him to be involved or tamper with the 'supernatural' or they can't test it. No, you have many years ahead because that is average human life expectancy. Add good health and no illness or accident and there you go, 70+ years of life. And if that does end it's by chance. Why would god have to rely on natural processes to carry out his supernatural will? He made the earth and universe and man by a whim without any process needed. So why does he need cancer, or leukemia, or accidental falls to ""take"" people away? If it's his will why aren't there more deaths with no detectable causes? You won't know when I will die and who are you to say when I will live and die when your just a mortal like I am? . I could die in 5 minutes, 5 hours, or maybe even years before I die and death comes unexpectedly.  I never said I knew your grandmother. I never said anything I preposed was truth. It was hypothetical. Now I ask again, what IF you by chance did not know your grandma was hypothetically a secret atheist? Or broke a commandment? Then hypothetically, shed be in hell and itd be justified by your standards. I'm saying that is what's fucked up Well you said what happened if she didn't believe in God and asking all of theses foolish questions and lame excuses because you don't want to deal with the facts and you have your dumb science that practically takes all of your life. Science isn't always going to be there for you when you need it like God."	"God knows the truth behind the world and everything because He is the one who made the universe and everything in it You have yet to prove god so this is empty and meaningless. No human being can know every single feature and why it does it Of course not, but humanity as a whole can achieve the knowledge and document it. There will be many theories of how life came to be and how the universe came to be but they will always leave God out of it because they don't want Him to be involved or tamper with the 'supernatural' or they can't test it. Well theres a handfull at the moment that do have quite a significant amount of evidence so i dont think there will be many more. Yes they will leave god out of it because science works to find truth, not fairytales. The god hypothesis is a non-answer to the question of the universes creation and is useless. Science asks ""how did we REALLY get here"". Incorporating god into that would mean whenever scientists get stumped they would fill the gap with ""oh well, must be god"" which is absurd. Also how can they say ""oh well god did it"" when god hasnt even been proven to exist? They arent afraid of him ""tampering"" with anything, they just leave him out because he's an unproved myth and not worth investigating. Yes he is untestable and therefore not worth investigation because that which is untestable usually doesnt exist.  You won't know when I will die and who are you to say when I will live and die when your just a mortal like I am? No i dont, never said i knew 100%. I have basic medical knowledge and i can say as an educated guess that should you be in a constant state of good health suffering from no accident, disease, or disorder that you will achieve a standard life expectancty of all humans which for you would mean about 70ish more years. Were mortal but we do know when its likely we'll die, its not the stone age anymore.  I could die in 5 minutes, 5 hours, or maybe even years before I die and death comes unexpectedly.  Of course you could, i know that but if youre in a good state of health then for you to die in such a short amount of time you wouldve had to have been the victim of an accident such as a car crash, or murder. Now, the point im going to make is that should that occur (i do not wish it to) it the accident that kills you, not god. For instance if you die by getting hit by a car, god's will didnt ""take"" you, the car slammed into you ending your heartbeat and killing you. Or its the bullet that shuts your brain down that kills you, or the cancer that kills your lung cells that kills you, not god. If god truely was the reason for your death then your heart for no reason other than gods will would stop. that never happens. People always die by natural means. So if god really ""took"" people at their ""times"" then he shouldnt need to rely on that car, or that bullet, or that disease to end your life. The fact that he does suggests he cant really control anything at all and if that is the case then why should he exist? Well you said what happened if she didn't believe in God and asking all of theses foolish questions and lame excuses They were hypothetical questions and scenarios but i can see you dont understand that and take them literally. I never said your grandma didnt believe in god, all i said was that HYPOTHETICALLY ,IF she didnt. IF. then by your own belief she would HYOPTHETICALLY be in hell. And i wanted you to stop and think about how you would feel if HYPOTHETICALLY she were in hell. Then you may understand why i was angered and how people feel when you judge other peoples friends and family that have passed using your religion. Its hurtfull  because you don't want to deal with the facts What facts? Youve supplied none.   and you have your dumb science that practically takes all of your life.  Wrong, i have my dumb LOGIC and REASON that takes ahold of my life as it should all rational human beings. Its because of this logic that i accept the science because science is backed by evidence and god is not so logically i side with science. Sorry i believe some of the brightest minds in the world who come to conclusions about life based on experiments with visible observations and results i can see right before my eyes unlike invisible, unsupported god. Science isn't always going to be there for you when you need it like God. Actually it will be there.

Humans cant have evolved from something that still exists or is relatively new .	That's not how evolution works. Let me give you an example to help clarify the process. In a species, one of the animals has some sort of mutation. That animal continues to breed and passes along this mutation to its ancestors. Only that one animal and its descendants will have that mutation. All the other animals of that species that don't descend from the one with the mutation will stay the same. For example, some humans are born with dwarfism. That means people with dwarfism evolved from average sized humans. Thinking that monkeys shouldn't exist if humans evolved from them is the same as thinking that average sized humans shouldn't exist because dwarfs evolved from them, or black people shouldn't exist because white people evolved from them. They are all just different branches of the evolutionary tree.  Technically speaking, humans didn't evolve from the monkeys we see today. Both humans and all the other primates evolved from a common ancestor. Each species of primates is just another branch on the evolutionary tree. <a href='http://www.vi.cl/gepe/f33027.jpg'>Here's a very rudimentary phylogenetic tree showing some of the branches of primate evolution. A complete phylogenetic tree would have many more branches.	0

You seem to be under the common misconception that marriage is a religious term. It isn't. If you do a quick search on the history of marriage you'll find that it predates recorded history. There are records of marriage as old as 2350 BC, long before your religion even existed, and it has taken many forms throughout history including polygamy, polygyny, polyandry, endogamy, exogamy, common law marriage, monogamy, arranged marriage, and same sex marriage. It wasn't until 325 AD that Christian churches became involved in marriage. Before that it was thought of as a primarily private matter with no religious ceremony being required. Even today marriage is not strictly tied to religion. No religious ceremony is required to get married.	Hi, marriage started with Adam and Eve the first humans on earth. Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. therefore man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh. Also I never said that it came from religion I only said God created marriage.	0

My sweet tooth is not evil, neither were those kids in the novel. most of them were just too caught up in what they thought was fun, and did not want to spend too much of their time doing boring chores such as keeping the fire going.  you say desire is evil,  so what if you see a group of kids playing instead of doing homework, would you call that evil. it is the same ideal, it would be more reasonable to be doing homework than playing tag, yet to them tag is their number one focus.  desire over reason is not evil	0

I don't tell my friends who are non-believers they will burn in hell because if I do tell them that then they wouldn't be my friends anymore and if I pointed their error of their ways they would get upset.  You should tell that to RandomDude because he says it all the time I haven't said it in a long time so I don't know why your picking on me and telling me what to do. I	But you believe they will burn in hell, because they are not of the same beliefs/opinions - dictated by the scripture you follow or at least pretend to follow!

You're telling me I should name each and every single one? Or use one of the better known examples? Should I start naming the leaders and/or politicians of all the countries who've participated in the Iraq and Afghanistan war? Should I start naming all the people who voted FOR the war and all the soliders, generals etc. who participated in the war? Or should I use a well known example and the LEADER of the country most responsible for the war. I think the answer is obvious. Don't bother replying.	No, I'm telling you the President gets too much blame, along with too credit. The President does not have the power to declare war, so how can you blame President Bush for going to war? Bush isn't most responsible for the war because he can't declare war.	0
Not really. I am a Christian and I have no problem with same sex marriage.	"Uhhhhhh  Genesis 19:1-11 That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting there, and when he saw them, he stood up to meet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed with his face to the ground. ""My lords,"" he said, ""come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may then get up early in the morning and be on your way again."" ""Oh no,"" they replied. ""We'll just spend the night out here in the city square."" But Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. Lot prepared a feast for them, complete with fresh bread made without yeast, and they ate. But before they retired for the night, all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house. They shouted to Lot, ""Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"" So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him. ""Please, my brothers,"" he begged, ""don't do such a wicked thing. Look, I have two virgin daughters. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you wish. But please, leave these men alone, for they are my guests and are under my protection."" ""Stand back!"" they shouted. ""This fellow came to town as an outsider, and now he's acting like our judge! We'll treat you far worse than those other men!"" And they lunged toward Lot to break down the door. But the two angels reached out, pulled Lot into the house, and bolted the door. Then they blinded all the men, young and old, who were at the door of the house, so they gave up trying to get inside.

Atheists actively seek out ways to fuck with is I've put up with their bull shit my entire life. You know maybe those billboards wouldn't be up and maybe those states would allow you to run for office if you would stop being such thin skinned Pricks and let us have our fucking beliefs.	"Unfortunately some of what you call ""beliefs"" are completely unconstitutional like your socially conservative policies like banning gay marriage, also the ""under god"" bit in the pledge of allegiance was added in 1954 by the US congress and not written in the original pledge our founders never intended ""under god"" to be in the pledge it would be far more constitutional if something like under liberty could be added but they had to add under god even though not every citizen in America is ""under god"", the ""in god we trust"" on our money is even more unconstitutional once again implying that every single American believes in one god and worse off it was added by the federal reserve!"	0

Not all life forms grow in the sense of term we are using here so that one will have to be ignored, it was an unnecessary and unsufficient criteria to start with. Everything changes so continual change will also be ignored. We are left with reproduction and functional activity, and we have to find something that fits both these criteria. Computer viruses are capable of reproducing, and they are capable of functional activity. Since computer viruses follow both your criteria, following your definition of life, they must be alive. We wouldn't however call computer viruses living, so that means there's something wrong with your criteria.	so they can't die either. If it isn't living then it can't die. continual change preceding death which imply that it must be able to die You still have not presented anything that fits the WHOLE criterion. Just ONE thing that fits all of those details of the definition I presented that can be considered non-living. ALL OF THEM. It must also be an organism to be living....I'll just throw that in there to. an individual animal, plant, or single-celled life form.	0
Why assume I'm not American?	I don't know I just assumed you weren't. Call it wishful thinking	0
You've disputed me earlier comment; but your arguments don't seem to have any relationship to anything that I've said. Could you be clearer in identifying what exactly it is that you would like to dispute? Sounds like you're focused on the actions of each group, too; not the philosophies. This is true. I see both American atheists and American theists as being equally fanatical in their actions. American theists perhaps more crazy in their philosophies; but both equally nutty in their actions.	"I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists have less substantial arguments than atheists and theists of other nationalities; I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists only focus on demonizing one another and completely ignore philosophical aspects of the ""god question;"" I'm disputing your assertion that American atheists and theists contribute nothing new to that debate and subject; I'm disputing your implication that all American atheists compare religion to extremism and all American theists compare atheism to Stalinism; I'm disputing your assertion that all American atheists and theists focus on is the actions of their respective opposite groups and ignore the philosophies.  I am disputing these things because although some Americans obviously argue like this, not all do (as you implied). I am also myself asserting the opposite of many of your claims, if in a more general and moderate manner: sometimes non-Americans atheists and theists have very weak arguments regarding their faith or lack thereof; non-American atheists and theists have been known to focus on demonizing one another and ignore philosophical aspects; lots of non-Americans contribute nothing new to the ""god debate;"" many non-Americans make false comparisons of their religious opposites; occasionally non-Americans only focus on actions and not philosophies.  So in short, in addition to your original statements being stereotypical generalizations that are equivalent to racism, the intent of your statement is completely lost and pointless because all of the things you singled out and criticized Americans for doing non-Americans do just as much. It's unfair and hypocritical, and I haven't thus far seen you produce a single shred of evidence or support for your position. So I went ahead and posted a bunch of stuff that refuted your assertions (Americans that do all of the things your criticize Americans for not doing, and don't do the stuff you criticize Americans for doing). That, my friend, is what I was trying to dispute.  but both equally nutty in their actions. Hmm... No. I don't know of any atheists who claim Jesus told them to handle poisonous snakes before dying from a snake bite. I don't know of any atheists who mutilate genitalia because they don't believe in god. I don't know that anyone's skeptical inquiry led them to make themselves a religious martyr and blow themselves up in a crowded area."	0

Atheism is irrational? Christanity essentially consists in believing an all-powerful benevolent (which is contradictory, since God forces people to worship, or apparently they are cursed to endure Hell for all eternity, if not) God that is capable of the impossible exists.  So no, atheism isn't the irrational religion.	"I didnt say christianity was rational, and im not religious, i dont trust religion, im just saying its irrational to deny your own human nature, thats like destroying your psyche, people dont understand that to believe in god you just have to believe, thats it, it doesnt require you to sell your soul, you dont have to take a huge long test, you dont even have to think about god at all, just acknowledging him and bringing good to others is enough to be in gods ""favor"" Religion is a form of control, none of the stories make sense when given alot of thought, and yes, the god in the bible is highly contradictory, but the fact remains, is that they still believe in some type of god, some type of creative life force behind everything"	0

I wasn't the one who downvoted you, but I'll respond.  Admittedly paper may weigh more then plastic, and therefore produces less CO2 emissions, but there are other factors to consider. Paper for example comes from trees. Trees absorb CO2. Assuming the trees are being grown for the future use of making paper products, the the trees would more then likely absorb enough CO2 to make up for the weight difference. Also, because paper is a natural product, when it is thrown away it degrades naturally and doesn't significantly harm the ecosystem. Plastic on the other hand is not biodegradable and stays on the earth forever (see argument on other side of debate). If trees are just being cut down and not replanted the issue becomes more complicated, but in general I would still say that plastic is more harmful.	"i'll admit that plastics are harmful, but that doesn't make them beneficial. currently, the law is to replant any trees that are cut down, that still doesn't change the fact that an entire tree has been cut down. now, i support ""Green Bags"", mainly because they can be reused over 9000 times and only can help stores make money instead of lose money as plastic and paper does. the fact is, if we're just replanting, that doesn't change the fact we are still producing more carbon by using paper instead of plastic. if we leave the trees and only use plastic, we would still produce carbon. and, paper is much harder to recycle than plastic... i do my part though, i use neither (use Green Bags... well, mine are black)"	0

Global Warming is a lie. Here in my state, we only get an average of 5 feet of snow each year. Last year, we had 13 feet of snow! It is recorded that the Earth warms up every seven years then cools off. Other then that, the highest tempature in my state was back in the 50's. The coldest tempature in my state was in the 80's. Global Warmin is just a big fat lie so more people can get more money.	I'm sorry to say but yearly temperature fluctuations in your state are hardly relevant to rising mean global temperatures.

I grew up about 10 miles north of Mexico. 98% of the population was Mexican-American. I had good friends, but I tended not to connect with most people just cuz of cultural differences. You'd be surprised how many idioms and little references don't translate at all. Take a rich white person and stick them in a black ghetto and they're probably only going to understand like 60% of what's going on. I would say that diversity is good for individuals. It can give you new perspectives. You can better understand humanity by seeing similarities and differences between cultures.  But people are by nature averse to outsiders. They like to hang around people similar to themselves. Diversity just tends to lead to smaller, voluntarily segregated communities. Go to any diverse area and you'll see Asians mostly hanging out with Asians, blacks with blacks, etc. That said, it's unfair to discriminate against people based on nothing more than their race. Community harmony is no excuse for bigotry.	Those aren't good examples. Neither of the communities that you spoke about were diverse. One had 98% Mexican-Americans, and the other was 1 white person in a community of blacks.	0
 	Human life yes I agree, but what you fail to understand is life does not have to be human with the same conditions we need to sustain us, or even carbon base life, in our universe there could be silicon, boron or even pure energy base life forms, so by pure scientific logic life in our universe is abundant, we as humans are so arrogant to think that life needs to be carbon based and has to follow the same set of rules we humans do to to stay alive.	0

Firstly: Why are women committing suicide? Because they can only have one child or because their child is being taken from them?	Firstly: Why are women committing suicide? Well, let's just think about it. Imagine a woman aborting her child because that child is female, and then imagine that woman having to live with the guilt of her decision. Imagine a woman who desperately wants her daughter, but has that daughter forcibly stripped from her womb. Imagine a Chinese girl growing up knowing that her parents wished she were a boy, because then she would have a greater value. These circumstances probably can be attributed greatly to the one-child policy. In this way, the policy directly contributes to elevation of males above females and it's easy to see the results.	0

Simply because He has chosen a certain path for a person, it does not mean that He has told them to commit suicide. It simply means that He has determined the choice of the person who commits suicide. Hence, we have a division of a revealed and divine will.	Any time you make a decision, it's because something told you to, whether it's your brain chemicals responding or another person. God causes those chemicals to react/respond by aligning his creation to do so, therefor he is telling you to do it.  It's the same situation as a scientist controlling a lab rat.	0
Adam and Eve created NOTHING by sinning. They only pushed the world away from God. This caused God's perfect world to naturally start degenerating, as nature tends to do that. This degeneration created the Aids virus out of something else, just like you believe dogs came from something else. Creation doesn't deny Natural Selection, it denies Particles to People evolution. Are you saying sin causes evolution??? How could a cell that did not exist before cone into existence out of thin air? You would argue it didn't come out of 'thin air', it came from a prettied-up primordial soup. I'm not saying it came out of nowhere, I'm saying it was something else and changed into the Aids virus No it was some other sort of virus.  We need not invoke the supernatural to explain change. Natural selection happens with or without a supernatural cause. Sin is actually a state of being, not an action. According to your made-up definition.	Are you saying sin causes evolution??? I guess you could say that, yes. Without God to keep our world perfect, it degrades. Degradation causes change, and change spurs Natural Selection to work its magic (I use that in cliche, not saying it's actually 'magic'). So yes, sin causes evolution. No it was some other sort of virus. We need not invoke the supernatural to explain change. Natural selection happens with or without a supernatural cause. Yes, it was some other virus, but now it's not. I do not disagree with Natural Selection. You're right that we don't need to invoke the supernatural to explain change. But it wouldn't need to happen had sin not entered the world. According to your made-up definition According to the science of religion, sin is separation from God.	0

Your first point - yes I agree that most other intelligent life forms show signs of such traits and are not unique to humans. However, I was more referring to our superior intelligence, hence our efforts to produce laws, employ policemen, doctors and carers. Surely allowing something like eugenics would undermine and offend the intelligence and courteousness of our species? As for your second point - are you suggesting that because something is acceptable in our current society, we should do nothing to question or do to solve the problem?	I do not think you can offend something that does not exist, and I do not think that the human species is as intelligent, fair, courteous, and so on as you believe it to be. Discrimination has been present in human society for as long as we have a recorded history. To be clear, I do not support eugenics (I have actually posted against it) and I do advocate for improving conditions where we can. My objection with your argument is not that your conclusion (eugenics is unethical) is incorrect, but that your justification (eugenics offends the benevolence of society) is not grounded in reality. Does that make more sense?	0

Not really. We have more accurate writings from actual historians who lived at those times and theyre far more accurate. We also have lots of archealogical artifacts and such that our historians have used to recreate life as it was back then. Far better than the bible which is more focused on propogating a religion than giving an account of daily life.	"It does give historians a sense of ancient writing styles and give them a sense of the mindsets of different people from back then. I don't see how one writing is more ""accurate"" than another if its just writings. It just shows us how people thought. It gives us a sense of what people believed back then."	0

You just pointed out that the grading system is not a good system to evaluate a student's performance. How? You need to know exactly what they were learning not what grade they got. Well that's what AP tests, SAT, and ACT are for...	How? The grading system makes it so that in order to determine how well the student actually did you can't look at their grades. You have to look at what kind of classes they took. Then you have to research how much those classes really covered. You can't just say, oh, that person got 10 A's they must be really good. Well that's what AP tests, SAT, and ACT are for... Thus demonstrating that the grading system doesn't work that well. If you need extra tests in addition to the grades to determine how good the student is, doesn't that mean the grading system failed?	0
I truly believe that there will be, but not in the form of some magic array dispersing throughout the universe thus causing cataclysmic activity, but more of an inescapable destiny that will happen on its own, such as nuclear war breaking out. I think God wiped out the dinosaurs because he realized that they could not progress any further, so he created these fleshy vessels and put angels or souls inside of them which gave the angels the freedom that they desired.  Though, I am sure that once again, the reigning species will become obsolete and will have to be replaced again, which those angels who have been corrupted, to hell, and allowing those angels who remained pure, to live in paradise once more. It's a reset basically.	We still have dinosaurs. They're called birds.	0

"People who claim to have no religion are liars or don't understand what religion is.  I am atheist and find that I differ with most other atheists on this subject. I would like to read some thoughtful arguments about it. Well, the first paragraph makes the assumption they know the minds of every person who claims to be atheist and at the same time fails to define religion. ex. If one, like one the other side of this debate does, defines religion as anything done religiously Then sure, everyone has something or many things they do religiously, and in that sense, okay they're religious. But that is not the definition of religion that an atheist is going by when they claim to not be religious. Now, I don't know the percentage of people who claim to be atheist, but are really just agnostic, but that lack of understanding in whatever percent in no way negates the first paragraph's misrepresentation of both what religion is, and their lack of understanding the inter-workings of other people's minds. Take me for example, since I am the only one I can speak for. I'm an atheist. I think the idea of a god is silly. I think biological life is a result of circumstance and evolution over billions of years. I believe life is inevitable in any environment given time and the necessary ingredients. I believe intelligent life is inevitable and in no way depends on a creator. I believe when I die, I'm dead, and I will have no feeling, knowledge, or concept of being dead, I simply will no longer be. I think that's what most atheists believe. But I don't presume to know what other people are thinking. I'm open to only what science says as far as life and death. I don't believe religions, prophets, or magic, I think those things are superstition, nothing more, like breaking a mirror or a black cat. As far as morals, I prescribe to philosophy, not any religious text. I think that religious morality is based again, on superstition, and like superstition, some is good, some is bad, and it is rarely based on thought. Philosophy on the other hand is all thought, and unlike religion, philosophy can change its mind based on evidence. Again, I don't know what is in the minds of other atheists, but I imagine it is very similar to this. Now, does that not sound like an atheist? Where is the god I worship? What miracles do I believe? What ""answers"" am I appealing to a higher power for? None. Yet, according to the author of the first paragraph, I'm a liar or don't understand religion. I would submit that perhaps it's not my misunderstanding of what religion is, or that I'm some sort of liar, but that perhaps the author of that quote is them self a bit confused by the entire thing. Maybe they are still struggling with some indoctrination, maybe they're one of those undercover theists trying to ""just get atheists to ask the question."" Whatever the the situation, it is clear they have spent little time considering the concept that other people do not necessarily think of things in the same light as they do. I find the assumption that I, an atheist, have not already asked these questions thoroughly of myself before deciding on my own personal philosophy, a bit insulting. Atheists make up around 18% of the world population. Even less of the US population. Very few atheists grew up in homes that did not prescribe to one religion or another. Holidays suck if you are really an atheist, they are annoying. Why on earth would one pretend to be an atheist? I mean, even if I didn't believe in a god, wouldn't it be easier to just play the game? Well, I think religion is harmful over all, so I put up with stuff like ""People who claim to have no religion are liars or don't understand what religion is."" and continue to attempt to try to explain clearly my own point of view."	"Thank you. I don't mean to come across as insulting, just provocative. If one, like one the other side of this debate does, defines religion as anything done religiously Then sure, everyone has something or many things they do religiously, and in that sense, okay they're religious. I argue that someone who is atheist ought to subscribe to a definition of religion that is also atheistic. Strangely most atheists prefer the definition of religion rife with theological connotations. I think atheists should engage in religious debate with influential theism promoting individuals but cannot do so in as meaningful of a way without first coming to terms on what ""practicing religion"" means. I think us atheists ought to stop denying that we practice religion. We are subject to the same sort of folly that anyone else is including theists. We may misplace trust as well. But that is not the definition of religion that an atheist is going by when they claim to not be religious. Agreed. Shouldn't atheists favor an atheistic definition of religion? Now, I don't know the percentage of people who claim to be atheist, but are really just agnostic As if people cannot be both but that lack of understanding in whatever percent in no way negates the first paragraph's misrepresentation of both what religion is, and their lack of understanding the inter-workings of other people's minds. nonsense alert I think the idea of a god is silly. Then theists won't take you seriously in discussions...which is fine if you don't aim to be influential But I don't presume to know what other people are thinking. my you do seem offended!! I'm open to only what science says as far as life and death. I don't believe religions, prophets, or magic, I think those things are superstition, nothing more, like breaking a mirror or a black cat. And theists, (much like you) are open to only the authorities they deem worthy. Being opposed to superstition I get and support. What I try to do is find what is honorable from various traditions (I don't absolutely exclude any) and honor it/them. It is also important for me to be critical of aspects of traditions that stand out to me as objectionable. As far as morals, I prescribe to philosophy, not any religious text. So if you understood religion the same way I do. Philosophical considerations including texts (valued by you) would strongly influence your morals. I think that religious morality is based again, on superstition, and like superstition, some is good you should replace ""religious"" in the above snipplet with ""theistic"" (just my opinion take it easy) What superstition is good? , some is bad, and it is rarely based on thought. Philosophy on the other hand is all thought, and unlike religion, philosophy can change its mind based on evidence. I identify theism as making religion less adaptable. Now, does that not sound like an atheist? Sure but not necessarily someone opposed to all forms of theism Where is the god I worship? I detect an integral element of theistic worship in the following: I'm open to only what science says and your concept of sound science is infallible? You have more in common with ""religious"" people than you think - methinks What ""answers"" am I appealing to a higher power for? If you believe that two heads are better than one then you have access to a ""higher power"" that has nothing to do with theism. Yet, according to the author of the first paragraph, I'm a liar or don't understand religion. I am convinced it is the latter the author of that quote is them self a bit confused by the entire thing. not as confused as y....LOL Maybe they are still struggling with some indoctrination who isn't? maybe they're one of those undercover theists trying to ""just get atheists to ask the question.""  could you please explain that? Whatever the the situation, it is clear they have spent little time considering the concept that other people do not necessarily think of things in the same light as they do. As evidenced by the first sentence after the debate hook line ""I am atheist and find that I differ with most other atheists on this subject"" I find the assumption that I, an atheist, have not already asked these questions thoroughly of myself before deciding on my own personal philosophy, a bit insulting. Is your personal philosophy decided? Have you made up your mind like worshipers do or are you open to change your mind based on evidence? Boo hoo. I am just having fun contrasting my opinion with yours. don't take it too personal. I was trying to be provocative enough for a thoughtful response. I think I got it. If you felt insulted you could always try to insult me back...lol Why on earth would one pretend to be an atheist? I would rather ask who might claim atheism but still be quite theistic without even recognizing it? Most atheists (just my opinion) This is too fun."	0
No it wasn't, the Native Americans didn't believe that land could be property, they were alright after a while with the British colonies, especially since we brought trade. The British colonies actually had an agreement with the Native Americans not to expand any further westwards. It was only after America declared independence that all the atrocities occurred.	It's pure speculation to say that the British were doing that for the cause of keeping a promise.  They simply could not afford to expand, and the Appalachians were a good point to defend behind. Yeah, it was bad of the US to slaughter the indians, but the Brits and even the indians would've done something similar if they had the opportunity.	0

"""If action A is ANYTHING like action B, then you're doing action B."" You're a dumbass OP, for several reasons.  First, asking for help is not prayer. If a god existed, perhaps help would be there. Perhaps starving children could get food, instead of lying on the ground, their stomachs burning as they lie there, too weak to move, just strong enough to pray. Then they die. If the above situation had never happened, if poverty and hunger did not kill children, perhaps I wouldn't be so hostile.  But it does.  Praying is useless and a waste of time. It's pointless feel-good activity with no real results. Praying is not having hope. I have hope, and I can wish for things, but until I get on my knees and ask a god to do my bidding, I am not praying. Praying is not asking someone real for help. I ask Jesus for help, I get nothing. I ask a real person? I get a yes or no. Not some vague ""It's god's will"" bullshit answer. Just as faith is not the same as earned trust, prayer is not hope."	"You're a dumbass OP, for several reasons. You big meanie pants. Jesus cries when you talk like that!  First, asking for help is not prayer. You need help if you think that!

It's pointless feel-good activity with no real results. when you have too many illusions about prayer it's almost a complete waste of time Praying is not having hope. I have hope, and I can wish for things Praying is being verbally clear and persistent about what you hope for. The Lord gets involved to change childish notions into loving action. until I get on my knees and ask a god to do my bidding, I am not praying. Regarding prayer, it is not the posture of the body that concerns god but the condition of the soul. Praying is not asking someone real for help. Prayer can only be heard by someone real I ask Jesus for help, I get nothing. I ask a real person? I get a yes or no. Not some vague ""It's god's will"" bullshit answer.

Do you mean is it used to describe things, that really shouldn't be called 'Art' often? Hell-to the-yes! Did you see any of the recent Joe debates about artists? A man sold a drawing that looked like a kindergartner's finger painting, for over 37 million. That said, I do think the word art is thrown around a lot, but rightfully so. Anything could be considered art if you can call it self expression, and someone can take something from it. This, what we're doing now, is art to somebody.	"Who should determine what is art and what is not art? Are you? If a man wanted a finger painting for $37 million, whose is to judge him for purchasing it? It was a voluntary exchange. What does it matter? The expression of ""get thrown around a lot"" has very objective connotations as to say that art is not the eye of the beholder but something else."	0
Actually it seems more like you've explained a debate. It doesn't say why being right is more important than understanding each other.

"Taken a bit out of context... but I agree with that the statement. (snap... did I just do a ""that the"" in English? Ancient Greek has taken over my brain!) There are senses in the Bible that are of loving yourself because your body is the temple of the Spirit. Then there are senses in the Bible that you should love others as you do yourself, because we are self-interested. There are senses in the Bible that you should hate yourself, which is your carnal nature. Then there are senses that you should be self-sacrificial in the giving of yourself to God and others as an offering to grace. Much more... So it really depends on the context...  In the sense of this debate, yes, you have to love yourself in order to love others. However, it is the type of love, in which is self-interested--almost saying, ""You love yourself this much, so love others with that same much."""	No I have not taken anything out of context. You Christians cannot think for yourselves, can you?	0
You got loads of people playing, slowing down the network and giving terrible lag. Not really everytime when I play the ps3 there is no lag for me and when you play online with other people it is not slow. I do have a great time with free PSN.	Well out of the 10-ish friends I have here who have a PS3, only 2 of them get good connection when they play with free accounts. The other 8 struggle with 1/2 bars all the time. It's just easier to get a good connection out of Xbox LIVE than it is with PSN.	0
God of War 1&2;(God of War Collection) were remade from onto the ps3 so basically yes they did make 1 and 2 for ps3 but had trophies and put HD into one and two. God of War Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus they were on PSP but made into ps3 for trophies and in HD. (God of War Origins Collection) Ps3 has a much slower loading time for its games Not really it loads perfectly fine for all my games. Who ever hacked ps3 was stupid and idiotic they just wanted to ruin our fun. If you look on Youtube on the console wars they say that the better system is PS3 and it tells you why.	But if you look on YouTube I'm sure there's videos that say that the Wii is better than Xbox or PS3 so in actuality that's irrelevant to the current debate.	0

"No. Would you want to be adopted by a gay couple? Think about all the bullying you'll get at school. Thats the worst thing that could happen to me, for my parents to both be male or female, how would i know what a proper relationship was meant to be like? Wheres my father or mother figure? So If I have two dads, how would I cope when I see my friends with their mums and dads. I think that Homesexuals being able to adopt is just wrong. If they were meant to have children together they would have been born with both genitals for goodness sake. Its not natural, its not how the world was supposed to be all this ""Allowed to love who you want"" is just bullshit to be honest. I know most people wont agree but next thing you will all be backing up Incest. ""Whats wrong with loving your sister?"" .. :l"	"My best friend was raised with two mothers. He's fine with it, no one bullies him. If they did he'd have a ton of people to back him up. He's proud of them and doesn't care if anyone judges them.  It is also scientifically proven that people are born gay. It's a chemical unbalance when you're in your mother's womb. It happens before you're born. So don't tell us it's ""unnatural"".  Also, how could you compare loving another (unrelated human of the same sex) to incest? You have serious problems if you can actually put the two beside each other and compare them. I'd like to see you try.  Last, but certainly not least. Attraction to someone is in the brain, it has nothing to do with where you're going to put your man parts in another guy. So, quit it with the whole ""gays shouldn't ""adopt/or have kids"" argument. What if a gay/lesbian doesn't want kids? Straight couples don't always have kids, so is that unnatural? No, it isn't. Everyone deserves equal rights."	0
Absolutely not. The mere thought of the Government faking 26 deaths for a change in law is completely unjustified, especially when it included so many children. There is evident proof of the actual occuring, not to mention a hurting town and state to boot. This affected the lives of thousands who were involved in one way or another, and this simply would not happen if it was a hoax. It is a pety notion and some people are not only pushing it on a still hurting nation, but on the families of the victims who were murdered.	I do not think it is a hoax, but you thinking that it isn't because you believe the government is humane is just asinine. The United States Government made marijuana look evil so they could throw people in jail, they put thousands of Japanese-American citizens in concentration camps, they killed over one million Iraqi civilians in the 2nd Iraq war ect. The United States Government is not humane, simply thinking they won't do something because it is evil or illegal is just naive.	0
The ones that use metaphor and symbolism. The apocalyptic ones are all symbolism. The creation is symbolism. Almost everything else is pretty good to go.	I think it's a given that the ones that you consider to be metaphorical, in your opinion, are using metaphor.

I'll ask a third time; what is your methodology for distinguishing between what is metaphorical in the Bible and what is not?	0

Oh come on! Those people listed were black, but they were definitely not the only people shot in american history. Nor were they the only people attacked because of their race. The racism that exists is being weeded out in government, and the places that it still exists heavily that aren't public are due to racists parents teaching it to their children, and their children accepting it. I'm back and i can attest to the fact that we are not being treated differently. Inner city white kids are being treated just as badly as inner city black kids. The race isn't the issue it's the social standing. OJ was exempt as you said because he had access to a fan base large enough to ensure his innocence, just as a white person with a good standing in life could get off too. Black people are historically coming from a bad place in life, what with slavery being only a few hundred years ago. People pass their reputations and money on to their children who do the same. Black people... are coming from no money. Black people that make it big, are mostly self made. It's statements like the OP's that foster racism. When we set our selves in the negative we only see that. We need to be upbeat and look forward to the advancing future.	What I said is not racist at all, it is fact .	0

Fair enough. I'm no gun expert. Wooooaaahhhh no way man. It's extremely powerful! It freaking two shots everything. Not that ist OP. it's fire rates fine. The FAD has way too little damage. And the cm901 sucks. Way inacurrate and too much kick.	I went and looked up the stats on the MW3 site, and according to them the CM and the AK do the exact same damage, except the AK takes more time to reload and raise. The ARC is a more statistically balanced version of these two guns. The FAD does do less damage, but it also has 33% more ammo that any of the other assault rifles and has the highest rate of fire, and those are the two things I like it for. My subjective opinion, but having a lot of bullets you can put down range very quickly comes in handy, sometimes.  If you're looking for raw stopping power it looks like the MK14 and the Type95 come out on top. The statistics don't include anything about kick, but I don't worry too much about kick, anyways; one shot, one kill, so there's no need to line up another shot. =D	0

"Ideological diversity is breed by environmental diversity, different jobs are and lead to different environmental states which lead to different ideas. Different ideas lead to different ways of doing jobs and different jobs, etc; this cycle adds to the ability of the community to produce, specialize and improve efficiency.   Differences in ideology is only antagonistic to ""state values"" if those values are counter to ideological diversity. Totalitarian states tend to have a ideological justification to their economic decisions which isn't allowed to be challenged by other ideologies, thus any faults in their ideology and the resultant faults in their economic decisions go unchallenged, ultimately resulting in collapse."	"Not necessarily. Persons of different professions can have the same political ideology. Not all supporters of Hitler were Nazis.  Differences in ideology is only antagonistic to ""state values"" if those values are counter to ideological diversity. This is a contradiction. You're saying that the only ideologies not against the state's ideology are those diverse from it. Different professions don't have to be opposed to each other, but diverse ideologies must be. A nation cannot be consistent if it is both capitalistic and communistic.  The flaw with an economic action isn't in whether it's challenged or not, it's based on the context of the economy. A good idea is a good idea regardless of if it is challenged or not."	0
"If there was a similar organization that called themselves a god worshiping congregation do you think many atheists would feel welcomed? God worshipping congregation - that's a church. And atheists don't feel welcome there - that's why they are starting their own churches. Not everyone has to welcome everyone. Next, people are going to complain that football teams exclude people who like soccer. Anyway, they call themselves a godless congregation because they are attempting to attract a group that would automatically be suspicious of a ""church"". Either way, it's a group of like-minded people getting together to share their similar beliefs."	"The reason I have a problem with them being exclusionary is because it contradicts their mission statement which states ""Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential."" They remind me of the <a href='http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/24/south-carolina-soup-kitchen-refuses-to-allow-atheists-to-volunteer/'>Christian-run soup kitchens that have been telling atheists that they can't volunteer there. The Sunday Assembly may not outright refuse to allow theists, but they certainly aren't going to make them feel welcome by calling it a ""godless congregation"".  If their goal truly is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"" and encourage people to ""live better, help often, and wonder more"" then excluding people just because they believe in a god is a bad move. Like I said, it creates an us vs. them mentality instead of a lets all work together to make the world a better place mentality.  If they want to exclude theists they can, but they need to change their mission statement and not pretend like they are really about helping the community as a whole."	0

Imploying humor as a means of support in a debate is ridiculous. One can believe in science and religion. Science tells how it's all here but not why. Science can't answer the transcadental questions that religion does, so it isn't illogical to be religious. Sir Isaac Newton believed in God and he invented calculus, I'm not so sure that you at your computer are so easily dismissive of a theory that one of the greatest mind's in human history so much adored. That is unless your brilliant mind can explain the movement of planets without calculus..	"You're making an appeal to authority, a fallacy.  Like every scientist, Newton believed in things that were untrue. For one, Newton thought the universe was static in position and infinite in span; modern science has proven these beliefs false. More importantly, Einstein and others showed that Newton's Laws are not universally applicable. Newton was also an anti-trinitarian. Should we tell all Catholics and many Protestants, ""Newton rejected the Holy Trinity and he invented calculus, therefore if you don't reject the Holy Trinity too you must reject calculus and the laws of motion""? Next, the limits of our certainty in no way verify the existence of a god. What does a lack of knowledge verify? Absolutely nothing. Fortunately, the human race has been endowed with minds brilliant enough to always push forward into the uncertainty. If everyone shared your thinking, we would have been satisfied with the Sumerian Pantheon."	0

No. Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of crime patterns knows that police presence after a certain point does not reduce crime; it temporarily displaces it. Law enforcement and criminals are the magnets that repeal each other. - Crime would likely drop a bit, but it would not be worth the resources.	Only 10% of police are hired.

I think you'll find it's exactly the thing an evolved species would do. Having the intelligence that we do, along with our over sized adrenal glands, inevitably leads to conflict. Look at any other species on the planet, and you'll see identical behaviour. And stop using evolution for ethics.	I don't see animals indulge in holocaust, mass genocide, massacres like nanking, become terrorists and bomb cities.  Animals attack each other for food and security. For survival and security ONLY. Not for greed. Animal species do NOT in any way show identical behaviour.	0
What Christianity is portrayed as, is not what it should be. It's been manipulated by the evil hearts of man.	That's something we can agree on. Certainly a god worth worshiping wouldn't have committed the atrocities he's famous for written in the bible, yet he has. Only answer, is fabrication in the telling of these stories. Yet if the bible is all you have to go on for your god, and you already know it is wrong, why believe in him, with no accurate description of his feats? Why fear god, if you don't know honestly how mighty he is? Why worship him, if you don't know honestly how benevolent he is? My answer to these questions, are simply don't.	0
"God doesn't damn his children and bring condemnation on them. Its actually Satan that does that not God.  That's why I believe in reincarnation, (not that I wouldn't mind an eternal darkness, it just doesn't quite make sense to me) because I strongly believe some part of us does live on after death. I think that once we die, our souls pass through into the ""otherworld"" or an afterlife, to go through karmic debts paid, and new debt to go. The afterlife is like a paradise, a vacation if you will. And once you are ready to incarnate into your next life, all ""wrongdoings"" in your previous life will result in issues in your next life. Lessons that you need to learn from in order to grow spiritually Reincarnation is flawed because if someone is clinically dead and comes back they aren't a new person or animal they are back as the same person as they once were."	God doesn't damn his children and bring condemnation on them. Its actually Satan that does that not God.  Satan is the warden of God's jail. God does the condemning, not Satan. Satan does the punishment after God has condemned someone to that fate.	0

Zero! I don't think the United States should have armies in 130 nations around the world. Can you imagine if China had troops stationed in Mexico, or Canada? America would flip the hell out.  But we're in Japan. We're in Eastern Europe. We're in Southeast Asia.	I don't think the United States should have armies in 130 nations around the world. I would tend to agree.

"There is the saying, ""The buck stops here."" If responsibility cannot be put on the man in charge, who then is to blame?"	You are talking about the FED which takes advantage of countries and governments and governments take advantage of the FED for the ease of creating money out of thin air. There is so much to this argument that is factual but it would take several pages to explain it. There is noway that Bush could have stopped it or even know how to. There is a really good book that Ron Paul wrote End the Fed it explains exactly why we have these bubbles and why the Fed who is the central banks are controlled by no one and answer to no one. Its funny how they are called the FED when they are not government at all they are banks. One of the reasons why we lost our surplus is because of war. In order to pay for it we have to borrow money from the Fed to pay for it and we take a loan out for it in the billions.  The amount that we our borrowing for war fails in comparison to what the current administration wants to spend on the fiscal budget right now estimates are at 1.7 trillion a year. That number is unsustainable and we as a nation should be very concerned.   Even though we had a balanced budget during Clinton it was a by partisan Republican ran Congress with Clinton that did it. So it is possible to have two different parties in Washington and still do good things like balance the budget.	0

No human being can know every single feature and why it does it.

"""News, you have to be kidding. Today we do not get news, just drama. Broadway cannot produce a show like the media puts on."" This is more inherently true of mainstream media, which is bankrolled by organizations who constantly filter what they report in the name of money than in the search of truth, than it is for independent sources. Publishing something online is cheap enough (quite often free) that people can do it without having to worry how they are going to pay rent next month. I grant you that this does tend to lead to disinformation, but one can fact check and use logic to weed such stuff out. ""Social networks, aren't they for cackle hens?""  Social networking sites aren't just for meeting new people, although we are welcome to do so if we wish. It can allow us to obtain near-immediate updates on the lives of people we already know who we don't get to see often. I am much more in contact with my extended family on facebook than I would be otherwise.  ""So much of the information on the Internet is disinformation."" More like ""so much information on the Internet is stuff you disagree with"". I already admitted that information online can be disinformation, but again, there are ways around it. Don't let a few bad apples ruin the barrel for you.  ""What is in print, is at least consistent."" Never in the history of humankind has that ever been true. And consistency does not equate to truth anyway. Someone can be consistently wrong. And format does not have anything to do with veracity.  ""Entertainment means nothing to me, I have in search of knowledge not games."" Knowledge is an admirable quest, it is my top use of the internet. But the occasional game or movie can have emotional benefit. And I sometimes like to listen to new music while I educate myself."	My meaning in the terms consistency, is one cannot simple change what is written on paper as easy as on the web. A book takes much longer to revise. The truth, is it ever really told? I doubt it. To many factors for unbiased account of events to ever occur.	0

""1) Easier for war"" How is it easier for war? Having troops all across the world would make it HARDER to wage war would it not? And should we even be in wars? The purpose of a militia would be defense, not war.  ""2) Much easier to intercept attacks such as aerial attacks."" Having troops, no matter where they are, will not stop an aerial attack. For that we would need an aerial defense system, which, while owned by the government and used for purposes similar to war,  would not be a part of the army. I agree that we need a way to defend ourselves. I do not believe a standing army is the solution. ""3) We can track enemy movement and decisively plan and train our soldiers for any event we may encounter."" Please elaborate on this as I do not see how this is something done by a standing army that cannot be done without one. In conclusion, the most fundamental thing which you do not understand is that our current army is not one which is prepared to defend our homeland. Our troops are spread out all across the world policing other countries, not protecting us. By the way, is this the serious debate you wanted? ;)"	"Why might Korea hate us? I wonder... Maybe we brought it on ourselves... Korean war perhaps? Well we can't change the past. We have to deal with the future. We have a standing army which is spread out all throughout the world, they are not exactly able to protect the homeland from another country are they? If we had a militia which was ALWAYS in the homeland, we would be better protected/defended than we are/would be now. I am mostly talking about a homefront standing army. I am aware that our troops are everywhere, but if they were here they would be much more effective? The way to do that would be to withdraw our troops from other countries That's fine. However this debate doesn't exactly have to be centered towards America. It's any nation. I think America is just being used as a prime example because we are familiar with it. The fact that we are the ""world police"" is the reason countries hate us, the reason they might attack us, and the reason we would need to be defended. It goes had in hand with this debate and is completely relevant. Not really. The debate title I made was  Should a NATION have a standing army? I am just wondering if a nation should have one. America's world police business is for a different debate. You are right, we can't change the past. You are also right about manipulating our futures. What you do not realize is that, with a standing army, we are already beginning to repeat our mistakes, the ones that got us in to trouble in the first place. Affairs with other nations got us in trouble. The simple possession of a standing army would not spark such things. We invaded and killed. That is what got us in trouble. Simply having a standing army does not logically imply that it sparks wars because of its existence. How is it easier for war? Having troops all across the world would make it HARDER to wage war would it not? And should we even be in wars? The purpose of a militia would be defense, not war. The debate question is for a standing army. Should a nation have one or not? If a nation has all of their troops at home the populace doesn't have to fight. They can remain calm and relax and hope for the best and if things get ugly they can show offense as well. Having troops, no matter where they are, will not stop an aerial attack. For that we would need an aerial defense system, which, while owned by the government and used for purposes similar to war, A soldier has to detect it first. If a jet is coming in a soldier must alert someone and interception will begin in hopes of terminating the foreign object. We will also be ready to mobilize if there are more. A militia will not cut it. Please elaborate on this as I do not see how this is something done by a standing army that cannot be done without one. They are better trained. They are fully paid and it is a career option. Pretty much every single nation has some sort of standing army because they are far better trained for battle. Thats the point of a standing army. By the way, is this the serious debate you wanted? ;) I guess. I really didn't care. I just want to learn some new things. You seem to be smart and well educated so I can't complain."	0

I've read the art of war, you do know Sun Tzu was advocating peace when he wrote that? Plus politics in an individual battle means nothing, there's only life or death. Also Rome salted Carthage after obliterating it.	What he was advocating was not important. And neither is Rome's use of that tactic. Those are not relevant pieces of information. I don't think you know how a battle works. It not lord of the rings. You don't just have one big last man standing clash. Its a matter of fighting over days or weeks. Sometimes months. This is why leaders are important. Politics effect a number of things. Foreign resource intake. Officer assignment. What units are held in reserve as reinforcements and which are on the front lines. Soldier moral is greatly affected by the political relationship between the Generals. If you have to Generals who are politically at odds then the soldiers may desert or may not cooperate, food may be horded which weakens the formation. Thats especially problematic in places where your army isn't unified. Places like Greece.	0
Here are some sources for the medical numbers (and the some more stats behind them)... <a href='http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2007/20070718153509.aspx'>http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2007/20070718153509.aspx  Also... The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group often quoted in news reports, puts the number of uninsured Americans who do not qualify for current government programs and make less than $50,000 a year between 8.2 million and 13.9 million, far less than the mantra of 40 to 50 million. Next, more competition typically leads to better value or lower prices. We also need to work on better disclosure, so that consumers can actually comparison shop. The way healthcare is now, this is much harder to do. I love what immigrants do for this country. But if they want to be covered by our healthcare, they should pay in for it. If they are illegal and can't pay in, then they shouldn't have the privilege that US citizens have. Why is that unfair? And some people are offered way too many opportunities that they continue to pass up. Either way, all i'm saying is that most people put themselves in the situation they're in. Last but not least, I believe the government should force employers to ATLEAST offer some kind of coverage. But I don't believe in government run healthcare ala France, England, Canada, etc...	Your first source is obviously biased. Of course the Business and Media Institute (Advancing the Culture of Free Enterprise in America) would come up with figures that would attack the 47 million figure. The article doesn't clearly present how their numbers are arrived at. But fine, we can assume that ther are significant cases where people could be insured either because they can afford it or because they qualify in some way. But you'd have to admit that 8.2 to 13.9 million is a sizable figure (one that I'm not ready to admit - but will allow for the sake of argument). And if you say that the other half can get insurance than fine, that just means that the push towards univerasalizing isn't as a taxing as initially thought. Finding a way to insure the rest shouldn't then be as heavy a burden as previously thought. But again, I doubt your facts. I went to the <a href='http://www.kff.org/uninsured/7806.cfm'>Kaiser Family Foundation and found numbers counter to your claim. And here's some <a href='http://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/health/uninsured/whoaretheuninsured.html'>more information from the non-partisan source PBS Further, we aren't even talking about <a href='http://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/health/uninsured/underinsured.html'>the underinsured.

Language is a war tool for communication of orders to be yelled on battlefield without he enemy realising what's being said.

If the government wants the people to get along (which they do so they can maintain power) one wall they could begin breaking would be the racial barrier.

"For being a supposedly all-powerful being the one thing god seems to be unable to do is clearly and explicitly state his will to humanity. If we can agree nobody should take just the word of a self-appointed intermediary (clergy) on what god wants for you, then really your only source is the Bible. Well, if you give five different individuals each a Bible and send them into separate rooms to read the text and then tell you what they thought god wanted for humanity you would get some very different answers. There would be similarities, of course, but huge swaths of scripture are vague, ambiguous, or are contradicted by other verses in the Bible with no suggestion as to which verse should be followed and which should be ignored, so people are inevitably bound to arrive at different conclusions. For example there is a specific command to kill shortly after a general command not to kill. In these instances individuals must rely on their personal interpretation of scripture; there is no universally accepted explanation of what the Bible is or what it is trying to say.  You think you've got it right; of course you do. But so does every other Christian on the planet, and they all believe something slightly (or greatly) different than you do about their faith. Your interpretation of gods word is not the interpretation; it's your interpretation, and accordingly your idea of ""gods path,"" for example, is really nothing more than your subjective opinion based on your open-to-debate interpretation of vague, ambiguous, and contradictory texts influenced by the opinions of religious ""professionals."" In other words we can't be even remotely sure that your idea of what ""gods path"" is is actually ""gods path."" For all you know Ismalia's got is right and you've got it all wrong; all that the two of you have is your subjective opinion based on your personal interpretation, and your opinion isn't intrinsically more valid than hers just because it's yours."

"What is the army doing to protect us now? Watching, waiting, preparing, and reporting any suspicious activity. Such as North Korea's missile activity. Do we have countries attacking us? No, so who would the army be protecting us from?  True. Nobody is attacking us. Would a country honestly warn us if they wanted too? No. No country in there right mind would say ""Hey America, get your militia ready we are going to attack in about a day or two."" They are protecting us from any possible threats and any dangers that may threaten the United States. Yes, I am aware of 9/11. But, is there a chance that, maybe, we brought that on ourselves? Even if America did we could avoid this from happening in the future. When we have a standing army, we find something for them to do. Going into the Middle East to help bring order was something for the army to do, and, it did help protect one of our interests: Oil. The problem with bringing order to the middle east is that the government overstepped its boundaries when it did that, and it made a lot of people mad. True. We didn't have to do all that. I think that America's ""world police"" status is for a different debate though. Flash forward a few years and we are dealing with ""terrorist threats"", however, if we had not been in the Middle East in the first place, would those ""terrorists"" be mad at us, and even more than that, would they even exist? Or would they still be farmers, men trying to earn a living for their families. Well we can't change the past so we can only manipulate our future. We need to protect ourselves from them. But back to the original point, a standing army is unnecessary, and having one only leads to war. 1) Easier for war 2) Much easier to intercept attacks such as aerial attacks. 3) We can track enemy movement and decisively plan and train our soldiers for any event we may encounter."

The purpose of a militia would be defense, not war.  ""2) Much easier to intercept attacks such as aerial attacks."" Having troops, no matter where they are, will not stop an aerial attack. For that we would need an aerial defense system, which, while owned by the government and used for purposes similar to war,  would not be a part of the army. I agree that we need a way to defend ourselves. I do not believe a standing army is the solution. ""3) We can track enemy movement and decisively plan and train our soldiers for any event we may encounter."" Please elaborate on this as I do not see how this is something done by a standing army that cannot be done without one. In conclusion, the most fundamental thing which you do not understand is that our current army is not one which is prepared to defend our homeland. Our troops are spread out all across the world policing other countries, not protecting us. By the way, is this the serious debate you wanted? ;)"	0
"More power to them let them sue you the judge would laugh in their face. Here is how the trial would sound like.

If one has been given free will to act in a manner we would deem to be either good or evil, then he could conceivably commit acts which we view as being evil. The Problem of Evil precludes free will.	But your argument here has no bearing on whether there is a necessary logical inconsistency between the existence of evil (and suffering) and the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient and wholly good God.	0
Can the living God who created heaven and earth lie? Is He cruel and does He like to trick us? Earth and the heavens were not created, however, so it is a lie to attribute them to a god. Can the one who took the concept of a human being and wrote it genetic code not use language to communicate something that is accurate to us? If He can write a genetic code I seriously doubt He would have a hard time writing something as simple as a book. The genetic code and the human race were not created either. Is the creator of language unable to communicate using language? Is that omnipotent being incapable of preserving His word. We created language, actually. Seriously, if there is a problem with God's word it should be logically obvious that the problem lies with us and not God. Because how does an omniscient being make a mistake? And we all know that we make errors in thinking and judgment all the time. Correct. The problem which lies with us is that we made a wrong assumption about the universe, namely that it has a god.	Earth and the heavens were not created, however, so it is a lie to attribute them to a god. So, in your view, how did the universe begin? The genetic code and the human race were not created either. Same question as above, but with genetic code. We created language, actually. If we created language, and random chance is making more information in the world, than why are languages getting more simple? The farther back you go, the more complex the writing system is, the more complex the language is. It seems language would start simple and we'd be somewhere around Traditional Chinese now, instead of the opposite.	0
ASSUMING it was a fair battle(a ratio of 1:1) the romans would win. If you do the battle under the proper Emperor, then there'd be no compeition.

The working conditions of the people in Magnitogorsk were harsh. There was no food to eat and the system was unorganised. Not enough tools to use and working was very dangerous. The workers were forced to meet the state production targets.  Many innocent people are accused of being GULAGS and were tortured to death. One million and nine hundred thousand GULAGS were killed. Living conditions in industrial cities were very poor. Population was under-nourished. The place was very dirty and there were many pests such as bedbugs and vermin are abundant.

You need to note that Iron man is also a genius, much like Batman. When it comes to smarts, batman doesn't have a advantage. (Although Iron man is quite arrogant) Although I only really know much about marvel, and I don't know much about other comic strips. The only big difference I know of is Marvel characters don't hide their identity and the plot always seems more interesting (to me). SO I don't know all that much about batman or superman. Still, Iron man is my favorite hero from marvel, being that his only super power is his brain. Batman on the other hand at least has some fighting experience/know-how.	You need to note that Iron man is also a genius, much like Batman. That's true but I think batman is more vicious than Tony. And Tony's egoistic behaviour could be used against him.

You either have the right or not, if the constitution says you have the right to unabridged freedom of speech an this has been interpreted in a way to abridge that right then freedom of religion can be interpretated similarly. If not then talking about being an Atheist is covered under freedom of speech. Either way being and expressing that you are an Atheist of whatever is covered under the constitution.	I'm not saying I agree with the limitations on our speech I'm simply saying they are there. And the constitution never says specifically we can say what ever we want.

First off to address your other comment, what does a movie have to do with this? Secondly, to say Cassie Anthony had 'true love' for her child that is why she killed her child to stop her child from enduring the pain that she puts on the child does not make sense because if 'true love' existed why did not Cassie just act out of that 'true love' in the first place? why? because it does not exist.  If perhaps she later got 'true love' for her baby then decided to kill her, that is simply to avoid any drama for beating her kids. If she had an insight and 'true love' is real then she would have gave the baby to parents that would have loved her. Cassie killed her baby for herself not out of any insight of 'true love'. <--- that's what i believe though she is let go with a not guilty verdict.	The movie 'Princess Bride' addresses the idea of true love, especially note the scene where Wesley is just mostly dead. Secondly. if 'true love' existed why did not Cassie just act out of that 'true love' in the first place? why? because it does not exist. Maybe Cassie Anthony didn't have true love for her child; but you are confused.  Just because something exist, doesn't mean everyone has it, or is capable of it. A bank account of a million dollars exist; just because you don't have it doesn't disprove this.	0

"I thought this debate was a joke. No offense to any Twilight lovers, but seriously? I've read quite a bit into each series (as much as I loath to admit) and the winner is blatantly obvious, even despite the fact that I'm a fan of neither. Reading through Twilight, I really just wanted to get it over with (I'm one of those people who bought it just to find out what the craze was about); it honestly felt like I was reading one of those cheesy fanfiction stories. The authors idea of 'love' is based solely on lust; for a woman in her forties, this is pathetic. Not only that, but I wanted to kill almost every single lead character in the story- especially angsty, self-pitying 'oh, my life is so hard!' Bella, and the obsessive, overly controlling dick named Edward. If you want a good 'vampire' romance novel, I'd suggest giving ""Let the Right One In"" a try; it's a million times better, focuses on more than just appearances, and actually reaches a realistic emotional level. Now, Harry Potter might have started out for a younger audience, but the books themselves actually grew up along with the people who were reading them. The writing style is definitely more sophisticated, the characters are likable (sometimes even relate-able), and the plots are a lot more complex than what they would initially appear to be. That's my opinion anyway; I won't down you for yours."	NO OFFENSE LADIE BUT IN YOUR FORTIE YEARS OF LIFE YOU DIDN'T LEARN NOT TO GO WITH THE HYPE.

"You asked god (correct me if im wrong) to prove to you he existed correct? And then you read the bible. The bible is what ""proved"" to you he existed. So god didnt really do anything, you yourself did by reading the bible yourself. See what i mean? You sought out the answer to the prayer, god didnt really answer it. Yes I asked God to prove that He existed and He did answer my prayer because the Spirit of God told me to read the Bible and I choose this book in the NT and I found out a verse that proved He existed and I also looked up resources on the internet and found tremendous about of evidence of Him. God did answer it because if He didn't the Bible wouldn't be here and it wouldn't be God's Word that led me to the Bible.  A real answer and real PROOF of his existence would be if you had not done anything at all. Not read the bible or did internet research, nothing. If you just went about your daily life normally then BOOM god starts talking to you or you see him or something tangible that you didnt do yourself. See the difference? Well God does talk to me everyday when I do something God sometimes tells me what to say because He tells me inside my head what to do and its a little voice but sometimes its hard to hear but sometimes I do hear it. Also God isn't going to all of a sudden out of the blue have a loud enough voice for you to hear to talk t you.  Also, reading the bible does not prove god is real. Of course if you read the Koran it will say their god is real. Of course if you read a Wiccan spellbook it will say their god and goddess are real. Its just words on paper. It's meaningless and certainly not proof enough to believe that god exists and everything written about him in the rest of the bible is true. Actually it is proof that God is real ether accept it as fact or go along the error of your ways and do what you want. The Koran has scientific errors I have a link I could show you that's if you want to see it which I highly doubt you want to see it."	"Sorry i took long, i needed to do this on my desktop and all i had was my ipod. Yes I asked God to prove that He existed and He did answer my prayer because the Spirit of God told me to read the Bible Ahhhhhh so now its the spirit of god that told you? i have questions. How do you know it was ""the spirit of god""? What did it say? How did it speak to you? This is highly unlikely and you have no support for it so i call BS.  I choose this book in the NT and I found out a verse that proved He existed and I also looked up resources on the internet and found tremendous about of evidence of Him Keyword: I choose. You did the work, not god. If the book floated into your hands it would be god. If it magically flipped to a certain passage, that would be god. But you choosing to read the book whos sole purpose is to persuade people to believe in god is not proof at all. Also, oh you found tremendous evidence? how come i havent? and how come i never hear it from you and all i get is false logic and non-arguments? God did answer it because if He didn't the Bible wouldn't be here and it wouldn't be God's Word that led me to the Bible. I dont see how him answering your prayer is supported by the bibles existence. That made no sense. Actually in truth the bible was made up by man so yes, the bible can exist without god being real. Just as harry potter exists without Harry being real. Understand? Well God does talk to me everyday when I do something God sometimes tells me what to say because He tells me inside my head what to do and its a little voice but sometimes its hard to hear but sometimes I do hear it. That makes 1 person. Nobody hears a little voice in their head other than their own. People who hear more than that are called Schizophorenics. If you hear the voice of god you must be the only one because if he were real BILLIONS would hear it and they dont. I highly doubt your some super special christian who hears this. I once again call BS Also God isn't going to all of a sudden out of the blue have a loud enough voice for you to hear to talk t you. Why not? i thought he was all powerfull? It seems like he always has to make things really hard for people trying to reach him. Actually it is proof that God is real ether accept it as fact or go along the error of your ways and do what you want. How is it proof? Nobody knows who wrote it. Its riddled with historical inacuracies, scientific errors, and physical absurdities. How is that one little book from bronze age primitive people proof of a being outside of space and time that created everything? There needs to be other sources. Let me explain how the claim and evidence system works: Lets say that i tell you i have a baseball. Now, you dont need a twelve page report on why i have a baseball to prove it to you because its such a small claim that you can just take my word for it because who cares if i have one or not? Lets say i have a limited edition Fender Strat guitar signed by Elvis.  You wouldnt just be able to believe me on that one, you would need some evidence. Not a lot, but some to back it up. So i show you a picture of me playing the guitar on my phone. Thats enough proof and you say ok i believe you have this guitar. (Still with me?) Now about god. I go up to you and say that theres an almighty creator of the universe who made everything but hes invisible and his son died for our sins so we can go to the happy cloud place and not the firey bad place. Now youre like ""yeah ok buddy wheres your proof for that?"" because it is such a monumental claim that I need TONS of evidence to back it up like lab reports that experimented for gods existence, or eye witness reports, or pictures, or many many historical records of him/his work. Now i hand you a book. A 2000 year old book. With tons of errors, no known author, and thats it.  You look at me like im crazy. Because that one little book is not enough to prove such a huge claim. Understand?  The Koran has scientific errors I have a link I could show you that's if you want to see it which I highly doubt you want to see it. I know it does. Ive seen them. The point im trying to make is so does the bible. the bible says man came from dirt and woman from a bone, snakes can talk, blind people can suddenly see again, a man walked on water, a virgin got pregnant by no man, a fig tree spontaniously died, the sun revolves around the earth, the world is flat, the earth was flooded, a man rose from the dead and ascended to another world, someone became a salt pillar spontaneously. All of those are REDICULOUS. The Koran has scientific errors I have a link I could show you that's if you want to see it which I highly doubt you want to see it."	0
"I wasn't calling into question whether or not science is man made. I am just asking...assuming that it is... how one can with certainty conclude FROM THAT that it is IMPOSSIBLE to know anything with ""absolution”. You say: Epistemology is the study of how knowledge is obtained, and our science is just one way, our science just makes sense, but it doesn't mean it is a absolute. I believe that's true, but neither does it mean that knowledge obtained by humans can never be “absolute”. If my belief that I am typing a response right now is justified and true, than it qualifies as true knowledge. It appears that you are asserting that the reason knowledge cannot be absolute is because it's man made, and I don't see how knowledge being man made makes it impossible for any knowledge to be ""absolute"". I think at this point you should define what you mean by absolute."	Absolute or objective truth is a figment of our imagination because objective truth is rooted in man made, and there is only subjective truth as pointed out with the example of typing online.	0
"Not even close. Heavily religious. What definition of ""religious"" are you using? Theists believe in the existence of deities (i.e. god(s)). I agree that Heaven's Gate was (and still is, they aren't all dead) a religion; but it wasn't a theistic religion; but an atheist religion because they lacked a fundamental belief in any gods. Unless I'm wrong, their belief was that aliens did it all. Yes, the did get into a bit of genital self-mutilation; but there's no reason to suppose that that was associated with any kind of theism given their lack of belief in gods. When religious fanatics blow themselves up, they're doing it in the name of god and as a direct result of their religious teachings. When someone who happens to be an atheist blows themselves up (like the Tamil Tigers) they're not doing it because of their atheism, they're doing it because they are motivated by political, ethnic (etc.) reasons. So what is your take on groups in the Middle East that employ suicide bombings in the pursuit of secular goals? I'll quote from The Middle East Quarterly: [Some researchers suggest that to understand terrorism it is more important to study what terrorists do rather than what they say.[1] University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape argues, for example, that Islam has little to do with suicide bombing. Rather, he suggests, that suicide bombers, wherever they are in the world, are motivated much more by tactical goals. He juxtaposes the suicide terrorism of the (non-Islamic) Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) with Islamist suicide bombing to demonstrate that a desire to end occupation is the common factor rather than religion. Therefore, he suggests focus upon religion is a distraction and that policymakers seeking to stop the scourge of suicide attacks should work instead to address root causes, which he sees as the presence of troops or interests in disputed or occupied lands.<a href='http://www.meforum.org/1826/contrasting-secular-and-religious-terrorism'>2]. If this is true, which I'm inclined to think that it is, then the obfuscation of suicide bombing with religion represents a logical fallacy and poses a significant security risk to our secular way of life by keeping us focused on religion as the culprit while giving the non-religious motives of suicide bombing a free pass. In short, we're not likely to stamp out suicide bombing while we're focused on something that isn't really the cause. > If it did posses a doctrinal system there would be reason to suppose that they would be immune to the violent excess that we've seen in those that posses a doctrinal system? If you possessed a doctrinal system that clearly prohibited violent extremism, then it would be reasonable to presume that atheism is immune to violent extremism because that's the whole point of your doctrine. However, as painful as it might be to hear, that there is no doctrine means that you can do anything you want. Secular morality or personal morality might prevent most atheists from engaging in violent extremism; but lets not assume that we're all in possession of the same personal morality. To address what I think you're trying to say, here, I never implied that atheists were immune to violent excess. Fair enough. It seems to me in order to arrive that the philosophical conclusion that god doesn't exist, which is what atheism asserts, some manner of thinking and/or questioning must have occurred, which is all that skeptical inquiry means. Not necessarily. While some atheists have indeed gone though a logical process of questioning religion and come to a conclusion that either there is no god or that the existence of god is unlikely; some atheists simply label themselves atheists for purely emotional reasons (mostly in response to some of the more violent or bigoted excess of organized religion). Still other atheists are technically apatheists that neither believe nor disbelieve in the existence of deities...they simply just don't give a toss about it. It's not a meaningful debate to them; but they're likely to either tick ""irreligious"", ""atheist"", or whatever religion might happen to be marked on their birth certificates. you seem to have two entirely different terms confused for the same thing. One is ""skeptical inquiry"" which means uncertain questioning, or doubtful examination. The other is ""critical thinker"" which is basically a reference to someone who thinks skillfully. You can be the most skeptical inquirer on the face of the planet and not be a critical thinker. Point taken. Excellent point, BTW. Speculation, I admit, but what am I supposed to think? There is some truth and some fallacy in what you've pointed out. If I've not taken something that you've said, it's because I'm not actually debating it. I'm not debating it because I either agree with the points that you've raise or I disagree with the point; but know that I don't have a sufficiently strong counter-argument. The parts that I do take are with parts that I agree so strongly with (NB: that's usually when it's something that I had previously disagreed with; but you've convinced me of your point) and that I want to alert you to the fact that you've persuaded me. Or that I disagree with and think that I might have a reasonably appropriate counter-argument. I should point out, the atheist/theist debate for me isn't an emotional argument. I do a lot of inter-religious debating and often the debates (if a debate can ever be considered ""over"") finish with a meta discussion among the participants as to how we can improve our debating skills or use of critical thinking skills. These days I've come to consider many atheists close friends though the debating process. We fight like cats and dogs online and then catch-up for network gaming sessions afterwards. I'm not a ""truth-seeking"" debater. I debate because I just find it enjoyable. It's like playing poker. But I prefer theist/atheist debates because its somewhat easier to tip your opponents hand by getting them a bit emotionally worked up every now and then. P.S. So far on createdebate.com, you offer the best debates from the atheist side. So I do actually enjoy debating with you. Most atheist debaters here (and I'm assuming this might be true of theist debaters on this site) get too emotionally involved in the debate which makes them either a pushover or not worth the time. You haven't lost it (yet), so you're putting up a good fight and THAT is something I can respect."	"What definition of ""religious"" are you using? MW, dictionary.com, wikipedia, it doesn't really matter. Heavens Gate is a religious cult by all their definitions.  I agree that Heaven's Gate was (and still is, they aren't all dead) a religion; but it wasn't a theistic religion; but an atheist religion because they lacked a fundamental belief in any gods. They worshiped Do, the Captain, and Ti, the Heavenly Father. Their dogma included Jesus Christ and teachings from Revelation, particularly those concerning salvation and damnation. Whatever that is, I don't consider it to be atheist. Heaven's Gate certainly isn't monotheistic, but they are not atheistic, either.  Yes, the did get into a bit of genital self-mutilation; but there's no reason to suppose that that was associated with any kind of theism given their lack of belief in gods. Because of the teachings of great ET beings, one of whom resided in the body of Jesus Christ and one of whom is referred to as ""the Heavenly Father"" they cut off their junk to prepare themselves for the afterlife preached by these divine beings. That sounds like theistic insanity to me.  So what is your take on groups in the Middle East that employ suicide bombings in the pursuit of secular goals? Unless I am much mistaken I don't think that anyone ever blew themselves up in pursuit of everyone having the freedom to worship whatever they like and believe whatever they choose. The Tamil Tigers certainly didn't act with this motivation. Secularism is just freedom of and from religion. You might say that their goals lacked religious motivation, something I admitted to already, but you cannot call them ""secular.""

Therefore, he suggests focus upon religion is a distraction and that policymakers seeking to stop the scourge of suicide attacks should work instead to address root causes, which he sees as the presence of troops or interests in disputed or occupied lands The most famous Islamic suicide bombing actually preceded the occupation of Muslim countries, so how could a desire to end an occupation that hadn't begun have been the ""common factor"" in the 9/11 attacks? If this is true, which I'm inclined to think that it is, then the obfuscation of suicide bombing with religion represents a logical fallacy and poses a significant security risk to our secular way of life by keeping us focused on religion as the culprit while giving the non-religious motives of suicide bombing a free pass. It's not true, not completely anyways, and I just showed you why. But I'm not the one claiming it's only one factor that drives people to blow themselves up; I said religion was a prominent factor. You're trying to deny that religion is involved at all. I have no problem admitting that the desire to end an occupation probably played a part in driving people to blow themselves up; I've already said as much. I'm just also saying religion was a factor, something you seem to be unsuccessfully denying.  You want to look at ""common factors?"" Look at suicide bombings throughout history and see how many of them have religious under/overtones and come back and tell me religion has nothing to do with it.  If you possessed a doctrinal system that clearly prohibited violent extremism, then it would be reasonable to presume that atheism is immune to violent extremism because that's the whole point of your doctrine. However, as painful as it might be to hear, that there is no doctrine means that you can do anything you want. But that doesn't make any sense. The doctrine that you claim to follow doesn't in any way physically or mentally prevent you from breaking it. The single core philosophy of Jainism is non-violence, but that doesn't mean that a Jain is physically incapable of harming someone. Possessing a doctrinal system or not does absolutely nothing to say that doctrine is always followed.  Indeed, you're saying atheism could be immune to violent excess if only it had a doctrinal system like theism does - except we see violent excess from the theists (the ones with the doctrine) too!  some atheists simply label themselves atheists for purely emotional reasons (mostly in response to some of the more violent or bigoted excess of organized religion). I've never actually met anyone who became an atheist (or a theist or deist or agnostic) out of spite. So I'll have to withhold my opinion on that until I've actually met someone like that, and become convinced such a person exists.  Still other atheists are technically apatheists that neither believe nor disbelieve in the existence of deities...they simply just don't give a toss about it. No, atheism is an assertive position: god doesn't exist. You cant be apathetic and arrive at that conclusion. You could be an agnostic, but not an atheist.  I'm not a ""truth-seeking"" debater. I debate because I just find it enjoyable. It's like playing poker. I'm in the same boat, but when you ignore my refutations of your assertions it feels like we're playing poker and I just won a hand and you refuse to give me your chips. It's just a debating pet peeve of mine.  P.S. So far on createdebate.com, you offer the best debates from the atheist side. So I do actually enjoy debating with you. Most atheist debaters here (and I'm assuming this might be true of theist debaters on this site) get too emotionally involved in the debate which makes them either a pushover or not worth the time. You haven't lost it (yet), so you're putting up a good fight and THAT is something I can respect. Thank you. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that I am American, born and raised. My main reason for getting involved in this debate was to show you that Americans are every bit as competent (and incompetent) as everyone else. I intended to demonstrate this with the substance of my arguments, but I guess I ended up proving it in a roundabout way with my arguments, themselves, and showing that I, as an American, can handle myself well in a religious debate, and thus Americans are not what you said they are.  If we had to stop the debate here, I would be happy with the result.  Also, it's not just the religious debates; I've seen people lose their emotional cool in debates about school uniform or ""Which Shout is Best in Skyrim."" It's just people not being able to handle their shit, not necessarily the subject matter."	0
"""If you have a private golf club that is men only, is that not discriminating against women?"" No. Because they also have a right to form a golf club for women.  ""It is designed for the ""exclusive use"" of a certain group of people to the ""exclusion"" of others""  Actually there's nothing stopping white people from joining. So it really isn't excluding anybody."	I agree that women could form their own golf club, but shouldn't they be able to join any golf club they want?	0
"How true this is. Religion doesn't have to be based upon God, it can be based upon a god. Albert Einstein once was asked what his religion was and his answer is as follows; ""My work is my religion, I work religiously."" Whatever is the center of your life is your religion. One's god can be almost anything. For some that god is alcohol, gambling, drugs, work, sex, computer games, etc. If you worship it, it is your god."	"I like how you decide to put only negative examples as what can take the place of God. Why not friends, family, love, empathy, or generosity? Do these require a belief in god? Are atheists incapable of these things? I can tell you that, as an atheist, I don't ""worship"" anything. There are certain qualities which I hold in high esteem, and those people which I care about, and even activities that I enjoy doing. None of these things I worship yet they are still a part of my life. I'm sorry but your simplistic view of people fails to take into account the complexity of life."	0

It wasn't a book. The Declaration of Independece was a document from our Founding Fathers. Yes everyone is created equally. You were made in your mothers womb just like how everyone else is here today and came out the same way like everyone else did.	Cattle were born in the same way, but we don't use every one of them for food or dairy products; just the ones that have desirable traits. Every may be born in the same way, but that doesn't mean they are equal in strength, intelligence, speed, endurance, etc. later in life. We really aren't equal to each other, that's why certain people are best for certain jobs. We all have the same rights, but we all don't get the luxury of exercising those rights all the time like other people. Therefore, we are not really equal	0
OK, I'll put it like this. The lion kills the zebra because it must eat to survive. The lion is not adapted to farm and sustain zebras. Thus, it must eat what it can find. It doesn't carry out an act of greed because it cannot carry out an act of greed. The human kills the cow because it must eat to survive. The human is adapted to farm and sustain cows. Thus, it doesn't have to eat what it finds. It does carry out an act of greed because it can carry out an act of greed. If the lion had a choice between one zebra or two, I find it unlikely that it would choose the former. I don't disagree that humans carry out acts of greed, that's obvious. We do it because we can, whereas lions and whatnot can't.	An evolved specie wouldn't do things simply because it can. If man can create atom bombs and destroy cities and kill people, it doesn't mean he should.  The argument that 'it carries out an act of greed is because it can carry out an act of greed' isn't a valid argument in the context which is created here: an evolved specie. Refer to the definition of 'evolve' I gave you somewhere else.  Mankind, if calls itself evolved, developed, superior and more intelligent than other specie on earth, bears a moral responsibility to not indulge in acts of greed and harm other creations. That's my point.	0

You were the one who went off track, I was merely responding to the points. And we aren't talking about a siege battle here, these were mostly open field battles. As for the politics, that is all relatively minor, plus any good general would give himself the best chance of victory over petty politics.  In any case we are talking about battle between romans and greeks(albeit the term had no meaning to the people of the time), and what history shows is the Romans winning the battles, politics and salting the ground and civil wars are irrelevant. That would be relevant if for an overall campaign, but set piece battles are fairly straightforward	The greeks often wouldnt fight in open ground. in a battle like in a scenario like the battle of 300 the hoplites easily won in battle.	0
Most criminals don't have property that is valued, because it is stolen. One cannot value something that was obtained in minutes, not years.  Criminals think it is a privilege to be jailed, it makes them fit in. They are now part of something. Ohio has the orange plate club. One obtains an orange license plate for DUI and the plates line the parking lots of bars. They proudly display what is supposed to be punishment. The only way to stop a crook is with their last breath.	"""Most criminals don't have property that is valued, because it is stolen. One cannot value something that was obtained in minutes, not years."" all criminals steal? wheres your proof of that, there are tons of criminals in jail cause of smaller things than some of the hardcore prisoners in jail. no prisoner can be rehabilitated? none what-so-ever?

"The overbearing leader, God. If it's not a requirement to believe in your god, then how can you even claim you're in a religion. I must be in your religion too because I also don't believe. I don't believe in God because it told me ""You must believe in me."" It's deeper than that and more spiritual. I believe in the possibility of God(s) because of the world I see around me, because of the beauty and complex nature of all that which I perceive and experience. Yes even through the rough and tough times, I still believe. I also believe in the existence of God(s) because I'm allowed to choose, I've got choices and thus I choose to believe. If I didn't have a choice then perhaps it would be different. There is more to it, as far as other reasons why I choose to believe in God(s).  Atheist have their logic and religion has theirs.

Read Pslam 5:5	I read the bible, i was a Christian for many years, reading the bible front to back is what made me a non believer.

LOL that actually made me laugh, i have to give props for that one :) But the fact that clothes are not part of us when we are born means we can change them? whereas our gender is something that is part of us when we were born should not be changed? hmmmm.... as a baby we are small but when we grow up -gulp- we CHANGE and get bigger. Now you will say 'but we shouldn't change what was given to us, growing is something that happens on its own and was already provided in our genes when we were born.' ok but when you get a hair cut are you not changing something that you were born with?	Your comparisons are ridiculous. A haircut? Growing up? Come on! None of that is like getting your gender changed. Do you think parents want to see their child who they raised and have fond memories of, swap genders? A gender change operation is extremely selfish in my opinion. Like I said earlier, society now accepts gays and lesbians... why do they have to swap genders? To fool a straight man or woman? Make them think that you're something you're not? It's living a lie.	0

You continue to talk about 'pure' species. What, exactly, does this mean to you? How about pure types? A reptile is a reptile. A fish is a fish. A mammal is a mammal.

Thank you. I still love God, but I do not like everything He does. The existence of evil, obey Me or die, stuff like that.

"JakeJ, I can assure you that my account is not fake...but, that being said here is my point. Any place (physical or virtual) that is exclusive to sex, race, religion, or otherwise, is actually discriminating. If you have a private golf club that is men only, is that not discriminating against women? So, why then is the website in question not categorized the same way? It is designed for the ""exclusive use"" of a certain group of people to the ""exclusion"" of others. That has nothing to do about being able to build a web site exclusive to a different group. It is about discriminating against ""race"" in this case, thus my comment about it being racist."	"""If you have a private golf club that is men only, is that not discriminating against women?"" No. Because they also have a right to form a golf club for women.

I understand the argument for a gold standard, I think that it won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now through. I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking, which is one of our main issues and has more to do with inflation than anything. But that is another debate.  Lets return to the original idea that if everyone started using gold for currency, its value would decrease. At face value, yes you would expect its value to actually increase under such a situation. And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on. Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc. The point I merely wish to make is that there are multiple processes which go on, some which raise the value due to increase demand, and others which are often less in magnitude and take longer to have effect, which lower the value due to increase in demand.	"""Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc."" This is not a monetary issue, this is a capital or consumer goods issue in the topic of production. And it's talking about the industrial uses for gold, not the monetary uses.  Can we agree that this doesn't apply to this debate?"	0

What's to say that science isn't killing us? Aids didn't exist when I was growing up. Cancer has become a common word. It is not religion that has created, anthrax, mustard gas, agent orange, the nuclear bomb, radiation, guns, etc. Science created these things, not God. One should be more afraid of science then religion, it has killed more.	I'm not saying that the belief is killing people. I'm saying the false belief with ill intentions can kill people. yet in the case of explaining something to someone, it's not hypocritical to debate with them on a level that they understand. Let me explain. If you insult everyone for not using a fancy vocabulary when they debate, then you are replying to someone who can't seem to use fancy vocabulary at all, it's not hypocritical to say drop to their terms to explain to them how they are wrong. It's not like you believe in speaking like a moron, you're doing it so morons understand.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was done primarily to stabilise relationship with the Native Americans after the French-Indian War. And the British colonists actually wanted to expand but couldn't because of the proclamation which is one of the causes leading to the eventual rebellion. Additionally, its pure speculation to say that the British would have slaughtered the Native Americans if they had they opportunity.	The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was done primarily to stabilise relationship with the Native Americans after the French-Indian War. Like I just said, they couldn't war with the indians due to high costs. Well, they could have, but the reward would've just been too small due to the costs and they had too much debt to begin with to make that sort of investment regardless of the reward. And the British colonists actually wanted to expand but couldn't because of the proclamation which is one of the causes leading to the eventual rebellion. And so we must ask why they put it in place, which was to stabilize their relationship with the indians, which was to avoid a conflict, which was to avoid wasting money. Additionally, its pure speculation to say that the British would have slaughtered the Native Americans if they had they opportunity. What about India, Ireland, and South Africa?  What about the dirty blankets handed out that very same year?	0
No, it isn't. We don't understand His ways, or the reason why He does what He does - but one thing He has made clear and that all believers understand is His love for us. Did you ever understand your parents' reasons for making the decisions they did? If not, did you still love them anyway? It's a simple concept, really.	"""Makes it clear""? He has a funny way of showing it. What about Africa, where millions of Christian children die every year? Is he making his love clear there?"	0

These are gypsies, TERMINATOR. Okay... What am I missing? Do they know how to read? Equality is an ideal and as such is not rooted in reality. Precisely. Thus, the desire for such is irrational. Yes, everybody else has to. As a citizen, it is your responsibility to obey the common law. Why should the common law be set up in such a way? Why must they be so strict? Why do they even have to dictate such matters? Why should slaves have been freed? I'm not against slavery. It's been part of European culture for two thousand years. Equality, that's why. People are always willing to take the shiny new rights, but not the responsibility. If a person is unwilling to conform to the same laws as everybody else, then they should not be treated as equals, because they refuse to act as equals. You're missing something here: They (i.e. The Amish, Gypsies, etc.) chose to live that way. They chose not to be equal [in those senses]. Slaves had no choice. The Amish do. The Gypsies do. If they chose to live that way, why shouldn't we let them? Why do we feel the need to control them - to make them part of a society they do not wish to be associated with? I do not think they should be regarded as citizens of the U.S.A.  Then what are they? Most were born in the U.S.A. and as such are citizens of the U.S.A. They are Americans. If they are not Americans, to whom does the land on which they were born belong? Unless ethnic laws are abolished. Under the law, they may be equal. In the eyes of society - or various aspects thereof- they shall remain different. One person shall look upon another person differently for one reason or another. Blind people shall be viewed differently by the sighted; redheads shall be viewed differently by blonds or brunettes. There shall always be something - however trivial it may be - which sets one person apart from others, and as such there shall always be some form - be it mild or not - of prejudice.	Okay... What am I missing? Do they know how to read? They probably didn't go to school, where would they learn to read? Considering that their parents didn't go either, or theirs... Precisely. Thus, the desire for such is irrational. Difficult is worth doing. Why should the common law be set up in such a way? Why must they be so strict? Why do they even have to dictate such matters? When you become a citizen, you have to accept responsibilities as well as rights. I'm not against slavery. Foolish, regardless of morality (I don't care much for the plight of other races either, unless they are citizens). Caesar knew and I know so too that slavery devalues the labour of the people whose lives it is designed to make easier. Why pay a white man when you can just whip a black man into doing it for you? You're missing something here: They (i.e. The Amish, Gypsies, etc.) chose to live that way. They chose not to be equal [in those senses]. The law is not a pick 'n' mix. I care nothing for what they do, so long as it is within the confines of the law. I do not agree with all laws, and do my best to oppose those I do not agree with, but I follow them to the letter.  Then what are they? Citizens of an Amish community. They are not part of modern American society, they are exempt from laws other citizens are not exempt from, they pay no taxes on labour within their community (and they only leave the community for Rumspringer, the majority of them do not vote, their society's laws are taken directly from the Bible, which violates the U.S constitution - they simply should not qualify as citizens. I see no reason why they should be assimilated, but they are for all intents and purposes a separate nation(s). Slaves had no choice. The Amish do. The Gypsies do. If they chose to live that way, why shouldn't we let them? Why do we feel the need to control them - to make them part of a society they do not wish to be associated with? Hence they should not be citizens - they don't want to be part of American society. Under the law, they may be equal. In the eyes of society - or various aspects thereof- they shall remain different. That is how the situation should be. The law objective, the people subjective. as such there shall always be some form - be it mild or not - of prejudice. See above.	0
"Because, the egg cell is just a cell, right. Cells are supposed to be defined by their DNA. So if you put cat DNA into a dog egg cell, the cell should grow into a cat. But it doesn't. Which means that animals are defined by more than just DNA. There has to be some other factor involved. Thus, no matter how mutated and random a DNA strand gets, as long as it's a dog, it's offspring will be dogs. Unless that other factor happens to also randomly mutate. But we can't assume that, as we don't know what that 'other factor' is. So, in the Cambrian Explosion, when there's loads of new body shapes (defined by more than just DNA), evolution claims that's caused by random mutation of DNA. But it's not. If it was, our dog-cat thing would grow into a cat. But it doesn't. So a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is not a Cambrian 6-legged sea creature. ""God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to reproduce more of its own kind."" --Genesis 1:25 (NLT, emphasis added)"	Because, the egg cell is just a cell, right. Cells are supposed to be defined by their DNA. So if you put cat DNA into a dog egg cell, the cell should grow into a cat. But it doesn't. Which means that animals are defined by more than just DNA. There has to be some other factor involved. This doesn't answer the question of why you think a somatic cell injected into a reproductive cell would produce an embryo in the first place, regardless of species. If the cell were to divide, it would produce two cells with cat DNA inside them, but unfertilized eggs do not develop into embryos and you specifically said you were not talking about interspecies fertilization. Why do you think there is 'another factor' necessary to prevent cells from doing something that makes no sense? Must there a be 'another factor' at work that prevents two men from having a baby, beyond the lack of necessary reproductive equipment? The rest of your post rests on the misunderstanding of genetics necessary to invoke 'another factor' into this equation, when one is not called for, so any response would be redundant.	0
Did not you think that it mey be a different type of friendship?	i don't agree that friendship exists if man and woman are very close. but if you've got a lot of friends from boys or girls, why not. of course in this case there are friendship between men and women. if you see somebody very close to each other, everybody will think that they're dating or something else.in my opinion one of them loves another and just can't tell about it. so i don't think that there are friendship between man and woman.	0
A all knowing, all powerful, creator god, created the serpent knowing that it would trick eve; ie god introduced evil into the world even if he didn't originally create the world with evil in it.  A god with such properties is responsible for everything.	Again, misunderstanding of Christian beliefs. God created Lucifer, who was the angel responsible for leading the worship of God in Heaven. He was a musician, un-matched. Lucifer, like all Angels, was given free-will, a mind of his own. Using that free-will, Lucifer began to be too prideful in his work and began to praise himself above God. For this, God rebuked him, but Lucifer held contempt for that and fell from Grace, taking many with him. When God created Adam and Eve, Lucifer's first idea was to screw that up. God does not make evil decisions, despite those decisions already existing. That's right, evil is NOT an aspect of the God who created the universe, but a choice, a choice that He had but never took. This is proven in scripture through the life of Jesus, who was tempted, as Adam and Eve were, in the desert during a fast. Jesus, however, refused to give in to that temptation. Jesus, being the phsycial manifestation of God, was tempted by evil- so too was God. To say that God created evil is silly. Evil is an IDEA, an idea that already existed, the same as good. Evil is a choice, not a power one bestowes upon someone, not a trait one can pass by way of creation or biology, it is a result of freed mind, a consciousness that is capable of making decisions- rational or irrational.	0
"Don't be ridiculous. I love marijuana. But it doesn't cloud my mind to not see some truth to what is being said.  Excerpts from the original essay (published in ""Under the Influence: The Disinformation Guide to the War on Drugs""):  According to federal drug surveys, about 11 million Americans smoke marijuana at least once a month...Out of these people, NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, had a little more than 10,000 members in late 2003. The Marijuana Policy Project had around 13,500. The Drug Policy Alliance had 10,500....In contrast, the National Rifle Association has 4 million members. The average stoner might turn out for festival-style protests like the Bostom Freedom Rally and the Seattle Hempfest, which draw tens of thousands of people every year, but strictly political rallies---that is, ones where you're there to make a point and can't smoke--are lucky to get 100. Compare this to the 'beer parades' of 1932, the anti-Prohibition rallies that drew 15,000 people in Detroit and over 100,000 in New York. They were not about getting drunk. They were relatively sober, if festive affairs where people held up signs that read 'We Want Beer and We Will Pay the Tax,' and charts explained how a tax on alcohol could help get the country out of the Depression.

Science and religion will never be able to co-exist because of the theory of evolution. There are just to many differences on how things came to be the way they are. So, the two parties will NEVER be able to co-exist.

Yes atheism is a religion because even though its a belief system in no gods they still have a belief in a god. Their belief system is contradictory. Atheists believe in evolution (which is a theory) which is their god. They have faith it exists and they have faith that the universe began with the big bang. That is their god wether they realize it or not.	you don't need to believe in evolution in order to be an atheist. Besides theroy in science is much different then other kinds of theroy.	0

"First of all, ya morons, if we were debating on God's existence, we would have to accept that if he did exist, we would NOT understand his true intentions. We're human beings that are limited by the physical realm. God is supposed to be supernatural and powerful and shit. So saying ""if God does exist, he's an asshole for letting evil happen"" is admitting that you're an ignorant fool who isn't serious about reasoning. You missed the underlying point. If a god is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, then evil cannot exist. It's a matter of logic. The converse is true: if evil exist, said god could not exist."	"You seem to have omitted a number of concepts in your argument: 1. If a god is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, then evil cannot exist. On the contrary, evil can exist. I fail to recall at any place in the bible where it says God is the Universe's police officer. He is the judge, when the evil doers have passed on, God will judge those individuals and punish them. He will not stop them, nor does it say anywhere in the bible that he will. 2. If evil exists, said god could not exist. If evil exists, it is the product of the free will endowed on humanity, not by ""choice"" of God. God gave humanity free will and the ability to choose; if humans decide to choose evil, (hypothetically) God will not stop them, he will simply punish them once they have passed on."	0

Not all Muslim women are happy, just like not all Christian, Hindu, Mormon, atheist or Jew women are happy. In general though, having Islam as a religion does not determine their happiness because they're either used to the religion or chose to embrace it. There's nothing particularly different about Islamic women when compared to other women; they just wear hijabs, fast during Ramadan, and pray five times a day. It's not fair to make a generalization as religion making them unhappy.	You just are not able to imagine how islamic women are different from other women. It is like earth and sky. If you don't know it, how can you argue about how they are happy? All things what you said are just little part of this religion. The true meaning of it is not to wear hijabs, to pray five times per day and other things. They just do these things not only because they must to do it. They express their beliefs and love to their religion by doing these things. The main meaning is to understand what they do indeed. What they feel by doing these things, what are their attitudes on it. Moreover, the main thing to worship to ALLAH by the whole soul and by the whole love of your heart. That's why everything depends on sincerity of worship of women.	0
"Now that I've played 'Devil's Advocate' for evolution, I shall argue against it. Too long, can't post it in an argument:  <a href='http://www.mathematicsofevolution.com/ChaptersMath/Chapter_230__Seven_Reasons__.html'>http://www.mathematicsofevolution.com/ChaptersMath/Chapter_230__Seven_Reasons__.html ========================================================== Taken from: <a href='http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm'>http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm ""The Cambrian Explosion Nearly all animal phyla made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET]) called the ""Cambrian Explosion.""[64] Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.[42] Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""[64] Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.[42] In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""[42] Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.[42] There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.[42] Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.[42] The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.[42] Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""[42] The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.[42] Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.[64] The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.[64] These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.[42] Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.[42] Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.[42] ""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time."" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College[86] Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”[86] "" REFERENCES: <a href='http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/references.shtml'>http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/references.shtml ========================================================== Argument against carbon dating. Taken from: <a href='http://www.creationworldview.org/articles_view.asp?id=6'>http://www.creationworldview.org/articles_view.asp?id=6 ""The Carbon14 ""dating"" method was introduced by Dr. W. F. Libby at the University of Chicago in 1948. He claimed that it was capable of dating animal, vegetable and human remains of fairly ""recent' origin. Recent, that is, for an evolutionist. Carbon14 is a long-lived radioactive isotope of Carbon. Carbon12 is the normal stable isotope of Carbon, which is the basic building block of organic life forms. As they say on Star Trek, we are all carbon based units. Laboratory research has shown that the radioactive decay of Carbon14 occurs in a half-life of 5,730 years. That means that starting with one pound of 100% Carbon14, half of it would decay in 5,730 years, leaving 50%, or half a pound. Then, in another 5,730 years, a second decay period would occur, leaving one quarter of a pound. The process would continue, halving the amount left every 5,730 years until, theoretically, nothing remained of the original pound. Carbon14 is produced in the upper atmosphere through the bombardment of Nitrogen (approximately 80% of atmospheric gases) by neutrons which come from the powerful cosmic radiation, primarily generated by the sun. This bombardment causes a nuclear reaction to take place. The Carbon14 produced by this process is then converted into Carbon Dioxide, just as normal Carbon12 is becomes Carbon Dioxide. The Carbon(14)Dioxide is then utilized by plants during their normal metabolism. Animals and humans who eat these plants take the Carbon14 into their systems just as they would Carbon(12)Dioxide. There is then a ratio of Carbon14 to Carbon12 in the bodies of plants, animals and humans which could be considered as ""fixed"" at the time of death. After death, the Carbon14 would decay and the ratio of the two isotopes would change. Evolutionists then claim to determine the amount of time since the death of the organism by measuring this ratio. The lower the amount of Carbon14, the longer it has been since death occurred. As you can see, the theoretical limit of the usefulness of Carbon14 would only be about 50,000 years. This would be the amount of time it would take for nine half-lives, and after that there would not be enough left to measure accurately. There are, however, many assumptions which have led to serious flaws in this supposedly useful method. First, one must assume that the decay rate of Carbon14 has remained constant and not varied over the years. This is an unwarranted assumption. There is evidence to indicate that quite the opposite is true. Experiments done with the radioactive isotopes of Uranium238 and Iron57 have shown that rates not only do vary, but can, in fact, be altered by changing the environment surrounding the samples. Second, there is the assumption that the formation of Carbon14 has been constant throughout the years. This, too, is a totally unwarranted view for two reasons. The Industrial Revolution caused a significant increase in the amount of Carbon12 in the atmosphere through the burning of coal. In addition, the initiation of atomic bomb testing on July 16, 1945, and the subsequent above ground testing that followed, caused a rise in neutrons which in turn increased Carbon14 concentrations around the world. Third, the assumption is made that the concentrations of Carbon14 and Carbon12 have remained constant in the atmosphere. Besides the aforementioned items, the amount of cosmic radiation in the past, and in particular the amount reaching the atmosphere, may have been dramatically different. If one were to believe the Bible, the earth was surrounded by a layer of water vapor between Creation and the Flood. If this water vapor did exist in the past, then it would have effectively shielded the atmosphere from cosmic radiation. This shielding would have drastically reduced the amount of Carbon14 produced. Fourth, Dr. Libby assumed that the amount of Carbon14 being produced in the present had reached equilibrium with the amount of Carbon12; he assumed that the two were in balance with each other. Since Carbon14 is a radioactive element, it starts to decay immediately upon formation. If you start with zero Carbon14 in the atmosphere, it would take 50,000+ years for the amount being produced to equal the amount decaying. One of the reasons that we know the earth is younger than 50,000 years old is that the amount of Carbon14 in the environment is only 78% of the amount that it should be, if the earth were old. Fifth, evolutionists have assumed that all plants and animals take in and utilize Carbon14 equally in their systems as they do Carbon12. Quite the contrary is true! Mollusks found alive off the coast of Hawaii have had their shells dated with the Carbon14 method. The shells were calculated to have died 2,000 years ago, yet the animals were still alive. Natural crude oil has been dated using the Carbon14 technique; yet evolutionists would teach that oil is too old to be dated using Carbon14. The grass used as part of the mortar in an old English castle, known to have been built only 800 years ago, was dated by Carbon14 to be thousands of years old. The list of non-compliant dates derived by Carbon14 is literally endless. All of these assumptions have caused there to be considerable overestimates using the Carbon14 technique. Today, most evolutionists, including Dr. Libby, would agree that the method is at best usable for only a few thousand years. In 1970, Dr. R. L. Whitlaw, collected a database of 15,000 Carbon14 dates attributed to various plant, animal and human remains. He grouped these three categories and then studied the patterns they formed. He found a number of significant points.  Whitlaw noticed that the number of human and animal remains increased from 7,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago. At that point there was an abrupt decrease in the populations to one-tenth the previous amount, followed by a slow and gradual increase to the present. He also noticed that the populations of creatures in North and South America lagged behind the population numbers in Africa and Europe. While I would disagree somewhat with the exact dates he attributes to the samples, both of his observations would be consistent with the biblical record. The Bible paints a picture of life initially originating in the Middle East and migrating across the world. This migration and growth in population would then be punctuated by the death of most air-breathing land-dwelling creatures in the Flood of Noah. After the Flood we would expect to see the same migration and population growth patterns develop for a second time. Perhaps the best description of the problem in attempting to use the Carbon14 dating method is to be found in the words of Dr. Robert Lee. In 1981, he wrote an article for the Anthropological Journal of Canada, in which stated: ""The troubles of the radiocarbon dating method are undeniably deep and serious. Despite 35 years of technological refinement and better understanding, the underlying assumptions have been strongly challenged, and warnings are out that radiocarbon may soon find itself in a crisis situation. Continuing use of the method depends on a fix-it-as-we-go approach, allowing for contamination here, fractionation there, and calibration whenever possible. It should be no surprise, then, that fully half of the dates are rejected. The wonder is, surely, that the remaining half come to be accepted. No matter how useful it is, though, the radiocarbon method is still not capable of yielding accurate and reliable results. There are gross discrepancies, the chronology is uneven and relative, and the accepted dates are actually the selected dates."" There you have it! The Carbon14 'dating"" method is as invalid as the evolutionary philosophy for which it was introduced and supposed to support!"" ========================================================== Another argument against radiocarbon dating. Taken from:http://creation.com/diamonds-a-creationists-best-friend Too long, can't post most of it! Objections (technical) and answers  1. The 14C readings in the diamonds are the result of background radiation in the detector. This shows that the objector doesn’t even understand the method. AMS doesn’t measure radiation but counts atoms. It was the obsolete scintillation method that counted only decaying atoms, so was far less sensitive. In any case, the mean of the 14C/C ratios in Dr Baumgardner’s diamonds was close to 0.12±0.01 pMC, well above that of the lab’s background of purified natural gas (0.08 pMC).  2. The 14C was produced by U-fission (this was an excuse proposed for 14C in coal, also analysed in Dr Baumgardner’s paper, but not possible for diamonds). But to explain the observed 14C, then the coal would have to contain 99% uranium, so colloquial parlance would term the sample ‘uranium’ rather than ‘coal’.1  3. The 14C was produced by neutron capture by 14N impurities in the diamonds. But this would generate less than one ten-thousandth of the measured amount even in best case scenarios of normal decay. And as Dr Paul Giem points out:  ‘One can hypothesize that neutrons were once much more plentiful than they are now, and that is why there is so much carbon-14 in our experimental samples. But the number of neutrons required must be over a million times more than those found today, for at least 6,000 years; and every 5,730 years that we put the neutron shower back doubles the number of neutrons required. Every time we halve the duration of the neutron shower we roughly double its required intensity. Eventually the problem becomes insurmountable. In addition, since nitrogen-14 captures neutrons 110,000 times more easily than does carbon-13, a sample with 0.000 0091% nitrogen should have twice the carbon-14 content of a sample without any nitrogen. If neutron capture is a significant source of carbon-14 in a given sample, radiocarbon dates should vary wildly with the nitrogen content of the sample. I know of no such data. Perhaps this effect should be looked for by anyone seriously proposing that significant quantities of carbon-14 were produced by nuclear synthesis in situ.’2   Also, if atmospheric contamination were responsible, the entire carbon content would have to be exchanged every million years or so. But if this were occurring, we would expect huge variations in radiocarbon dates with porosity and thickness, which would also render the method useless.1 Dr Baumgardner thus first thought that the 14C must have been there right from the beginning. But if nuclear decay were accelerated, say a recent episode of 500 million years worth, it could explain some of the observed amounts. Indeed, his RATE colleagues have shown good evidence for accelerated decay in the past, which would invalidate radiometric dating.  4. The 14C ‘dates’ for the diamonds of 55,700 years were still much older than the biblical timescale. This misses the point: we are not claiming that this ‘date’ is the actual age; rather, if the earth were just a million years old, let alone 4.6 billion years old, there should be no 14C at all! Another point is that the 55,700 years is based on an assumed 14C level in the atmosphere. Since no one, creationist or evolutionist, thinks there has been an exchange of carbon in the diamond with the atmosphere, using the standard formula for 14C dating to work out the age of a diamond is meaningless. Also, 14C dating assumes that the 14C/C ratio has been constant. But the Flood must have buried huge numbers of carbon-containing living creatures, and some of them likely formed today’s coal, oil, natural gas and some of today’s fossil-containing limestone. Studies of the ancient biosphere indicate that there was several hundred times as much carbon in the past, so the 14C/C ratio would have been several hundred times smaller. This would explain the observed small amounts of 14C found in ‘old’ samples that were likely buried in the Flood. Reference  1.

His defence mechanism is amazingly complicated, and could only have been created with all the parts working together perfectly. From twin ‘exhaust tubes’ at his tail, this beetle fires into the face of his enemies boiling-hot noxious gases with a loud pop. How can this be? German chemist Dr Schildknecht discovered that the beetle mixes two chemicals (hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone) which would usually form a dirty ugly mixture. The well-designed beetle uses a special ‘inhibitor’ chemical to keep the mixture from reacting. How then can the explosion instantaneously occur when needed? Dr Schildknecht discovered that in the beetle’s specially designed combustion tubes are two enzymes called catalase and peroxidase which make chemical reactions go millions of times faster. These chemicals catalyze the extremely rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and the oxidation of hydroquinone into quinone, causing them to violently react and explode—but not so soon as to blow up the beetle, of course! Common sense tells us that this amazing little insect cannon which can fire four or five ‘bombs’ in succession could not have evolved piece by piece. Explosive chemicals, inhibitor, enzymes, glands, combustion tubes, sensory communication, muscles to direct the combustion tubes and reflex nervous systems—all had to work perfectly the very first time—or all hopes for ‘Bomby’ and his children would have exploded!

Why don’t textbooks discuss the “Cambrian explosion,” in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed, instead of branching from a common ancestor—thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life?  3. Homology. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry—a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence?  4. Vertebrate Embryos. Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry—even though biologists have known vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages, and the drawings are faked?  5. Archaeopteryx. Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds—even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it?  6. Peppered Moths. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection—when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don’t normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged?  7. Darwin’s Finches. Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection—even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no evolution remained?  8. Mutant Fruit Flies. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution—even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory?  9. Human Origins. Why are artists’ drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident—when fossil experts cannot even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like?  10. Evolution a Fact? Why are we told that Darwin’s theory of evolution is a scientific fact—even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?

"""	Let's be clear here, the Cambrian explosion, is nothing more than a gap in the fossil record. It is not an error. It's a gap. For whatever reason, a great number of species between the Cambrian and pre-Cambrian periods were not fossilized. There are a number hypothesis regarding this, but to suggest that this somehow invalidates evolution is utterly absurd. The Cambrian explosion no more disproves evolution than a crocodile with a missing foot disproves crocodiles Any insistence that current radio-metric dating techniques are in error quickly hits a brick wall. If you believe that c14 dating is inaccurate, you might have a hard time explaining how these dating techniques always seem to be corroborated by relative location in the geologic column. That is to say, the older fossils are always found in deeper in the geologic column. If the dates are wrong, then how do you explain that? Or how tree-ring dating also seems to confirm the accuracy of c14 dating. 99% of scientists in the fields of natural science, accept the Evolution is a very real process.	0
Carbon dating doesn't lie essentially since it was done in three laboratories:University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. It date it from the Middle Ages, between 1260 and 1390.That is more then a 1000 years after Jesus.	They found a coating on the shroud that messed up the Carbon Dating and then redid the dating some other way and found that it was actually from the time of Jesus	0
There are 2 different types of citizens: 1.Natural citizens and 2.Naturalized Citizens. Natural citizens are born in the US while naturalized have to acquire citizenship. They are all Americans. But having a naturalized citizen with foreign ties wouldn't understand the American side of things as much as an American who was born here. The fear would be the same as I mentioned previously. Your heart could be in the right place, buts it's the fear that someone could is what keeps the law.	Incorrect. The is only one type of citizen: one that loves his or her country. Don't you know that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere?	0
"I think it's very easy to just point the finger at the Christians and say that it's all their fault. However, as a non-American, I've had too many disconcerting experiences of both American religion and American atheism. For example, when discussing ""virtual particles"" in subatomic physics, I've seen American atheists suddenly screaming that this is proof that there is no god. Like...the god question isn't even been discussed! We're talking about physics and suddenly there's a raving lunatic in the room talking about something completely different. Now, I've seen both Christians and atheists doing this and it seems very much to be an American thing."	We're talking about physics and suddenly there's a raving lunatic in the room talking about something completely different. Now, I've seen both Christians and atheists doing this and it seems very much to be an American thing. So your assertion is that only Americans are ever raving lunatics when it comes to religious issues? Do you consider the men who flew the planes into the twin towers to be raving lunatics, in addition to being homicidal maniacs? I do. I think most people do. So how can you even imply that religious insanity is a strictly American phenomena? Indeed, if you think about it, most of the religious insanity and most of the insanely religious people that has/have existed throughout history (we're talking upwards of 98%) existed before the USA even existed as a country, so I don't know how you can say things like religious and atheist insanity and nonsense is very much an American thing and expect anything but laughter.  I don't mean to be rude, but I really think you ought to have thought this one out more before you went and made a debate on the subject, especially since your position relies on the kind of shameless, baseless stereotyping and generalizing we see in racism. It comes across as very crude.	0
Is there a reason not to believe in a higher power. Both atheism and theism are based on faith. That's because both can not be disproved.	There is no need for disproving something that haven't ever been proven in first place (gods, magic, etc.)	0
Yes it is. Wishing someone a Happy Holiday, and especially a Merry Christmas, can be offensive no matter how well intended. It is spoken form a place of religious privilege, and either in ignorance of or with disrespect for the history of oppression religion has towards the non-religious and other populations. As a queer person and an atheist I have faced legal and social discrimination my entire life because of religion. Someone wishing me a Happy Holiday or a Merry Christmas is not unlike a man wishing a woman a happy man day or a white person wishing a racial minority a happy white day.  See my post over there for a more detailed explanation. <-------------------	"Dude, it's 2013! Your pity ship has sailed. You may have been oppressed by Christians in the past, but it's mainly Christians who have also given you rights (ex. legalized gay marriage, repealed ""don't ask, don't tell"", etc.). Also, if I remember correctly, homosexuality isn't specifically mentioned in New Testament. It's Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) that is harsher towards homosexuals, so if anything, you should be more offended by ""Happy Hanukkah"" rather than ""Merry Christmas"", because it's the Jews who wanted you to be publicly stoned to death. Christians just kind of have a ""you'll pay for it eventually"" mentality. I'm not religious, by the way."	0
"Imagine all of the money lost from not buying these ads, and then all the jobs lost. That's a bigger crime than addicting people. I would like some statistics on how much money is lost. Here's some statistics for you: according to the World Health Organization, 5 million people die every year from smoking around the world, or, 6 every second, a staggering number that could increase to more than 8 million by 2030. What you are saying is that the amount of money gained if we don't ban smoking and the tobacco industry is justified by the killing of millions of people???!!! That's not even all of the stats! I seriously believe that the money lost from smoking is a lot greater than the money lost by the tobacco companies if smoking did not exist. 1. Primary smoking and its health side effects. Look up ""side effects of smoking"" and you'll get tons and tons and tons of side effects that could be caused by smoking. According to the CDC, smokers are 23 times more likely than nonsmokers to get cancer. Smokers are 4 times more likely to get coronary heart disease, 2 times more likely to get a stroke and can cause AAA. Smokers are 10 times more likely to die from chronic obstructive lung disease. 2. Secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke affects people who relate and live with smokers, generally of the same family. Almost half of all children regularly breath in secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes 600000 premature deaths per year. 28% of all children deaths are attributable by smoking. Health defects are also shown in children whose mothers were smoking while pregnant. 3. Cost of life and healthcare. Obviously tobacco companies earn a lot of money. But what about all the money that you are not considering, such as the money spent on health care to cure side effects of smoking? Or the money lost from premature deaths and lost years due to smoking? Smokers on average lose 12 years of their lifetime due to the health effects of smoking...that's 12 years that could have been spent working and earning money for your family, or improving society. On a side note, smoking causes low blood circulation so you would feel a lot less pleasure from having sex...I'm sure that will convince just about anyone to stop smoking. All the jobs lost Are you kidding me? what about all the ""jobs lost"" from the 600 thousand children that are killed each year?"	"what about all the ""jobs lost"" from the 600 thousand children that are killed each year? Because of our stupid labor laws children can't work."	0

We have a great number of parts. But ignoring obvious logical contradictions, If we were created in the image of the trinity, why doesn't each individual consist of three distinct/identical persons?	"Simply because we have been made into the image of God, it does not mean that we should assume that we will be exactly like God. But to answer the point of the trinity, it is not one person, but two, who come together to form the reflected image of the trinity. In Genesis, while in the garden, God said that Adam and Eve became ""one flesh."" Moreover, the intention of God, and what He will restore in the end times, will be the continued relationship of God to His people. Hence, in the world today, we are to reflect the image of God by joining in union with a spouse, though not necessarily as 1 Corinthian 7 says, and to become one flesh, and while being in relation with God. In absolution, the church as a whole is Jesus' wife, while Jesus is the husband. Therefore, we have another reflection of the image of God, and the Trinity, since God the Father is the one who gives the church to Jesus. There is much more, if you want to go into theology, but this should suffice to answer the question."	0
I can understand that, but I just feel like there should have been a solution that was less dramatic than full out war, and less immoral than an atomic bomb.. I'm no expert on conflict and whatnot, so I can't really come up with any realistic solution that could have worked at the time. All I can say is that I wish so many innocent lives didn't have to be taken like that.	Yes, there 'should' not be war, there 'should' not be conflicts. But humans can't always understand one another, and we all have our wants. Some conflicts can't be resolved peacefully because of this simple fact. Yes, it's sad. But what can one do? D:	0

Church puts religious stuff into your imagination. It's the same reason that kids who watch Superman think they can fly.. Church is simply an institution for worship. Divine intervention comes to those who believe. It is not just imaginatory. Unless you wish to disprove every single experience that people have had so far. They are not.

How does it happen? Why does it sound similar with all tongues? Mind proving that it is just gibberish? Just some advice, tread carefully when talking about speaking in tongues, the real speaking in tongues is speaking in your own language and everyone understands I'm their language, or someone can translate extremely well with no training. Either way, it is not random gibberish to seem spiritual, which Paul warns about in Corinthians.	0
No it isn't I'm just stating my honest observation. I don't see how freedom of religion allows for the lack of religion. I just don't see it in the wording.	But again that does not mean lack of religion is something to be prohibited.	0
"This seems like a bad idea to me. While I wholeheartedly support their goal to ""live better, help often, wonder more"" I don't see why they feel the need to exclude theists. Why does it have to be a theist vs. atheist thing. Why not just make it about anyone who want to promote those goals regardless of whether or not they believe in god. It just further promotes the us vs. them mentality instead of a lets all work together to make the world a better place mentality.

Do you want your kids to freely believe in the devil and rebellion and hard drugs and sex and money?	Yes, children should rebel its part of growing up, hard drugs, sex and money never did me any harm, the first two are a good way to make the last. On a serious note though I've educated my kid on drugs, sex and money the good sides and the bad sides so they know what's what about life. Lack of education on these things is how we end up with teenage pregnancies and overdoses etc. I had to educate myself about these things, I was lucky didn't have too many problems and survived can't say the same for some friends though.	0
I am a Christian and I am a centrist prochoice progay proreligiousfreedom person who knows for a fact that we are all one human race. Tell me again how close minded I am.	"But the majority of Christendom doesn't think like you do. Most Christians are against homosexuality in some way or another and they generally oppose abortion. You stated the fact that you are ""prochoice progay"" as support for your assertion that you are not closed minded; it is fair to assume, then, that you believe antichoice and antigay sentiments indicate closed mindedness. When we consider, then, that most Christians conform to beliefs and behaviors that you yourself consider to be the opposite of your open-mindedness, does it really seem so unfair to you for Brainsikk to ask if Christians are often too close minded? You might not be closed minded, but then you're not a typical Christian. Typical Christians often believe in things directly opposed to your open-minded beliefs, so if we are asked if Christians are often too close minded, we can say yes."	0

So long as Kyptonite doesn't come into play, I have to favor Superman overall. I expect neither would be able to do much of anything in the way of damage to one another, but such a struggle would inevitably take a toll on the venue. Of the two, Superman is able to survive in the vaccuum of space, and Goku is not. In the event of the destruction of the planet in question, Goku would essentially be forced to flee, leaving superman the winner by default. If Kryptonite were to enter the picture, Goku would certainly win, but using that would be rather out of character for Goku. But either of these characters fighting the other would be equally out of character, so I suppose it should be considered.	Goku can live in space for as long as he wants.

True, but this isn't a national election ... it's a party election. There's no constitutional rule saying everyone deserves a vote in what's essentially a private system in some ways. Not that I'm disagreeing in general ... I do think the Democrats will risk alienating voters by not counting FL and MI, but the party as a whole can't just let primaries get earlier and earlier ... we'll be voting for the candidate in 2012 sometime in January 2009.

"""I have no issue with conservatives"" You're funny.  Anyways, whats so ridiculous about him? I know it's easy to be general but whats so ""insane"" about sitting down and reviewing historical facts and the common sense? What's so nuts about freedom and the Constitution you make things more complicated than they need to be."	"Hey Jake, welcome back. I can give you numerous instances where Glenn Beck has seen conspiracy plots, or accused people of being Nazis. He also is also blatantly out of touch with reality. Like when he claimed that Fox was the only network showing video of the flotilla raid <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/04/stewart-slams-glenn-beck_n_600486.html'>when every other network had showed it as well (thank you, The Daily Show). If you want more examples I'll be happy to provide. Jake, I never had a problem with conservatives, just ones that are nuts like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh. Some of the things that come out of their mouth's are ridiculous. If you think that all Beck does is ""sit down and review historical facts with common sense"" then you have yourself fooled. I've said it once and I'll say it again: you shouldn't be getting your political opinions from pundits. A pundit show is a show that is meant to appeal to a certain audience and represent a certain viewpoint. The shows secondary job is to present the news. The issue comes when there is a conflict with what the actual news is, and what viewpoint the pundit is advocating. When this happens, the pundit has to either ignore stories, misrepresent stories (a.k.a. lie) or make an appeal to emotion rather than logic (something that Glenn Beck does very well). Pundit shows (both those with liberals and conservatives) make political discourse frustratingly difficult. They merely polarize the political atmosphere and groups can't actually reasonably discuss the issues, but instead resort to talking points and demonizing their opponents (e.g. the liberal elite, or conservative wing-nuts). So that's why I don't like Glenn Beck or almost any pundit for that matter (also he doesn't like soccer)."	0
I am just curious to what other people think of the statement. I like to get a wide variety of opinions in the hopes that I can improve my own.  I'd likely state something along the following lines: How can you assert the existence of the metaphysical without any evidence in the first place?  I mean, I could say a completely undetectable metaphysical <a href='http://nyan.cat/'>poptart cat is in my car and that would be an equally valid argument.  The point is statements like this are meaningless, for I could come up with any hypothetical metaphysical object/being and it would be equally valid.	Your science did not create Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional herbal medicine and yoga. Millions practices it while others consider it silly. Like I said, it is only valid when you experience it. Why do monks spent so much time meditating? It is their key to longevity relying little none on vitamins and modern medicine. I dont suppose you can explain 'chi', inner energy do you? I may make this sound funny but it is to show you the limitations of scientific explanation.	0
"""Any absolutist attitude is always a religious attitude, and in whatever respect a man becomes absolute, there you see his religion."" Carl Jung.

Carl Jung. All that is is someone else's opinion, that's all, and it's wrong. If evidence says religion is false then that is exactly as it is, and yes, it is absolute, because it is backed up by abundant proof. Denying that proof is very stupid. If someone claims that Earth is round with absolute certainty then that is that person's religion? If someone saw a cat piss all over a pillow and that person says it happened with absolute certainty, then that is the person's religion? You see the stupidity? Religion means that someone or something has created all of this and is controlling all of this. Or claims anything nonexistent to be real and to be followed."	0
"The question is ""Is the problem of Evil a coherent argument against the existence of God(s)"". This does not say anything about a merciful or caring God. Merely the existence of a deity.  Right, but it follows with: In the philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is the question of how to explain evil if there exists a deity that is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient (see theism)."	"As stated, I am talking about ""the existence of God(s)"". The debate description merely gets specific ON SOME POINTS that will be brought up during debate. Even so, it all doesn't matter. Unless you understand a religion up to a point where others will believe that YOU believe in it (when describing it), you will not be able to debunk a religion."	0

From Dr. Peter Hammond's book: Slavery, Terrorism and Islam: The Historical Roots and Contemporary Threat. Islam its fullest form, it is a complete, total100% system of life. Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well. Here's how it works: As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in: United States -- Muslim 0..6% Australia -- Muslim 1.5% Canada -- Muslim 1.9% China -- Muslim 1.8% Italy -- Muslim 1.5% Norway -- Muslim 1.8% At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in: Denmark -- Muslim 2% Germany -- Muslim 3.7% United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7% Spain -- Muslim 4% Thailand -- Muslim 4.6% From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in: France -- Muslim 8% Philippines -- 5% Sweden -- Muslim 5% Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3% The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5% Trinidad & Tobago -- Muslim 5.8% At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world. When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Is lam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in: Guyana -- Muslim 10% India -- Muslim 13.4% Israel -- Muslim 16% Kenya -- Muslim 10% Russia -- Muslim 15% After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burning of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in: Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8% At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in: Bosnia -- Muslim 40% Chad -- Muslim 53.1% Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7% From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in: Albania -- Muslim 70% Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4% Qatar -- Muslim 77.5% Sudan -- Muslim 70% After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in: Bangladesh -- Muslim 83% Egypt -- Muslim 90% Gaza -- Muslim 98.7% Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1% Iran -- Muslim 98% Iraq -- Muslim 97% Jordan -- Muslim 92% Morocco -- Muslim 98.7% Pakistan -- Muslim 97% Palestine -- Muslim 99% Syria -- Muslim 90% &n;bsp;Tajikistan -- Muslim 90% Turkey -- Muslim 99.8% United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96% 100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace.. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in: Afghanistan -- Muslim 100% Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100% Somalia -- Muslim 100% Yemen -- Muslim 100% Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons. Understand that in some countries, with well under 100% Muslim populations, such as France, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these ghettos. There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrasses. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death.	With the evidence you provided would it not be safe to say islam is just another form of government? That is covertly infiltrating already established countries and governments set to overthrow them? and merely being disguised as a religion?	0
You may think planets were created by God. Evidence shows that planets can be created through natural processes. Not my belief. You may think that God performs miracles, but natural processes would result in the same thing. Not my belief. Science continual finds explanations for how the world works without need for a God. Your only claim is that you don't want to find a better explanation, so you go with God. What is my claim?	Ok, so God doesn't exist because He doesn't do anything. What is the point of getting everyone to agree that a being exists when you think that God doesn't do anything?	0
Feminism is about stopping the oppression of women, not oppressing men you retard.	hey, it might be about stopping girl oppression but they act really sexist to men.	0
And since I put my argument on this side, clearly I think that being right is the most important thing about a debate. My reasoning was all to support my opinion that being right is more important than understanding.	Actually it seems more like you've explained a debate. It doesn't say why being right is more important than understanding each other. You can be right and still misunderstand the other side.. so being right or being understanding doesn't automatically rule the other out.	0
I don't think I see how women are being victimized by being used in advertising. If its an issue of setting an unattainable standard for beauty then I don't think its a valid concern. First of all feminists don't want the task of pleasing men to be a priority, so they shouldn't care if men are looking for perfect 10's or not. Secondly men deal with this too. I'm no James Bond and will never be one. I don't know any males in person that are as attractive as movie stars, but I still feel the need to wish I had bigger guns and a perfect abs. Just because perfection isn't attainable doesn't mean acknowledging its beauty is victimizing of those that are unable to attain it. I think valid concerns of feminists include things like equal pay, equal opportunity, and an equal right to not be beaten and raped. I don't think that imagery of attractive women chasing down a guy that's spraying himself with axe directly inhibits women rights. The exact reason i buy scented deodorant and axe body wash is to have attractive women wearing almost nothing chase me down. That's not oppression that's just good advertising.  There will always be extremes and that burger king commercial does seem to be enforcing gender roles and shouldn't be aired. Most advertising however, in my opinion does not make women victims.  I know the biggest problem for woman's rights is the existing negative mindset and women in lingerie selling golf clubs does go along with this mind set rather than against. This does not mean that the ad is causing that mindset though. The mindset existed before TV, before magazines, and before anything that resembles modern media. In middle eastern countries where women seem to have it the worst, women aren't even allowed to show their faces or hair, let alone pose nude to sell some AK-47s in a magazine. Not only is sexism present in this culture that doesn't use women sexuality to advertise, it is far worse than sexism here. Of course this is yet another extreme but it definitely proves the point that ceasing to use sex to advertise will not end sexism. edit: I think people concerned with woman's rights should worry more about women in other countries that have no rights than about magazine ads.	'Feminists don't want the task of pleasing men to be a priority.' Advertisers try to do their best to make this a woman's priority. That is part of my argument. Try as they might, most women are affected by the small subliminal (and not so subliminal) messages they receive thousands of times over their lives.  'Secondly men deal with this too.' So because men experience it too, women are not being victimized? I won't deny men are pressured to look and act a certain way as well, but please try to understand that it is far worse for women. For every James Bond, there is a John Goodman, an Al Roker, a Patton Oswald, a Woody Allen, a Bill Gates, a Donald Trump. Men have lots of examples of powerful, successful, famous men that are not tall or thin or young or good-looking. Women have some, but many, many less; our beauty standard is much more rigid, far more expensive and a lot more painful and time consuming to maintain. From cartoons to celebrities, males can be goofy, fat, short, ugly, and old and still be portrayed positively. This is far, far less true for women. So few of us will ever reach anything close to the female ideal, and we are made to feel bad about it every day.  A common argument from males in this debate has been that men suffer too. And I haven't seen anybody deny that. But men are not the marginalized demographic in this debate. It can be hard, or nearly impossible, for a man to understand what it is like to be a woman, and it is much, much easier to write off our concerns as just being complainy or oversensitive. This in itself is pretty insulting, especially considered there is a lot of factual evidence to support these claims.  You are talking about this as if it's one ad or one single company that is single-handedly at fault, and that's not true. But when a hundred companies publish a thousand magazines, produce dozens of television shows, hundreds of movies, with women in lesser roles like this, what do you think children grow up thinking?  I understand people in a position of power are resistant to change and often deny there is even a problem. It's not pleasant to have it pointed out that sexism still exists, because lots of people would like to claim it doesn't. Often, looking to closely into it can make men realize that they have sexist tendencies, even if they mean the best, and that can be a nasty epiphany. You cannot possibly understand all the small ways in which women are discriminated against, and how they add up, because you have the fortune of never having to experience them first hand. This is male privilege, and here is a list of just some of the many, many minor advantages you have over women in American society. <a href='http://www.amptoons.com/blog/the-male-privilege-checklist/'>http://www.amptoons.com/blog/the-male-privilege-checklist/  As for your final point, I am well aware of how lucky I am to be born a woman in America. I realize that women in almost every other country have it worse off, and I do my best to support those efforts as well. However, I am not going to ignore sexism in America just because it is more blatant elsewhere.	0

Yes, immigrants do change the culture of Australia. They bring their food and customs with them, and most of all, they encourage racism! Look back at the previous generations, when europeans and asians came and changed everything, from religion down to food, public holidays and even the public's attitude to world events and choice of recreational activities. For example, most people in Australia are crazy about sport, infortunately. Hopefully, when more migrants come, they'll change the culture so that people care less about sport and celebrities, and give some appreciation to the arts.	Immigrants don't have a very big impact in Australian culture. And they don't encourage racism. When immigrants first come hey do bring certain customs and food, but after a generation that will change. The new generation will live like an Australian. And sport in Australia would not be a careless matter. Aussies love sport and they won't let it go!	0
Personal anecdotes and a quote from a notable figure are not proof. You have stated your case and stated it fairly clearly. However, the fact remains it is nothing but a personal philosophy. My philosophy is that people who choose not to involve themselves in a potentially dangerous situation do not deserve legal consequences. In fact, unless I am mistaken, police officers do not want bystanders to intervene in crimes in progress. Average citizens are probably not aware of the necessary safety precautions and legal procedures, and could possibly get themselves injured or complicate the situation.  Reporting a crime is a different matter. If someone is in a position of safety where calling the police could not conceivably draw negative attention to them, I do not see any reason why they should not do so. But this is only part of the debate and it would be almost impossible to enforce this as a law.	There are already some laws in effect to this nature. Doctors and teachers are required to report any signs of abuse. This is true in a couple of states anyway.	0

1. God is claimed to be perfectly moral. Moral by His definition, not yours. 3. God commanded Isaac to kill his own son to demonstrate his conviction. To demonstrate to Isaac Isaac's conviction. 4. He knew before hand of Isaac's conviction, and such a command is unecessary (due to 2) Yet that would not have shown Isaac anything. 5. Causing unecessary pain is immoral. As per your sense of morality. 6. Therefore, 1 is false (due to 3 + 4 + 5) There is no truth in morality; only opinion. 7. Therefore, 'God', as he is claimed to be, is not true (due to 6) 6 is invalid; 7, relying on the validity of the invalidated 6, is therefore also invalid.	Moral by His definition, not yours. & As per your sense of morality. & There is no truth in morality; only opinion. [Do to others as you would have done to yourself] The 9th commandment leads me to this conclusion, not my standard of morality, but that set out in the Bible. Does your entire argument for the validity of these claims lies on the conclusion that unnecessary pain is something we should want to happen to ourselves? There is no truth in morality; only opinion. Again, I refer to the ten commandments, and the words of Jesus. Christianity teaches that there is objective morality, either it is false there, false here, or God's actions here are morally correct.	0

Faith means knowing nothing .	No, faith means belief without absolute proof. I have faith in science, because I do not have absolute proof of it (and never will). But that is not to say that faith is foolish. You're making the mistake of thinking that proof gives absolute certainty. Different pieces of proof will only give you different degrees of certainty in something - but every fact you claim to know is falsifiable. See Karl Popper's Theory of Falsifiability - it says that any scientific statement is only scientific as long as it can be proven false. We think that there is gravity, but if tomorrow we start floating off, then it is possible (somehow) that the evidence has been wrong.	0

That's true. So, what percentage of the wealth of the country is owned by the people who pay for 52% of the taxes?	A flat tax is most equitable. It can be economically and morally balanced by ending subsidization. The question shouldn't be what percentage of wealth is owned by the highest tax payers, but what percentage of the wealth is produced by them.  Taxes provide dis-incentives. Income taxes provide a dis-incentive to produce.	0
i think there is no place for gay people marrying in the church i don't know why gay people would even want to marry in a church, i say this as a devout atheist and supporter of equality. I think passing laws regarding the church goes against secularism, where can imposing different beliefs on religions end (no matter how backward the belief system)	Gay people don't have to marry in a church. They can't marry in your privately owned home, why would they marry in your privately owned church? What they want is the right to marry, not be legally united, whatever that is.	0
God wants everyone to have the free will to do as they please. Even if that means that person wants to become a woman. He knew that the technology would be invented for it.

If I am free to have religion, but I have to have religion, then how is that freedom to religion?	But what I'm saying is the first amendment says that you have the right to be any religion you want to be. And as every atheist I've ever asked has told me Atheism is not a religion therefor I don't see how it applies.	0
Is there a reason not to believe in a higher power. Both atheism and theism are based on faith. That's because both can not be disproved.	"No there is not a reason not to believe in a higher power, however if not believe something requires no reasoning, because lack of action, lack of interest, lack of belief is the product of not having reason to have the action, interest, or belief. To believe something for no reason is by definition unreasonable however a reason to not believe something isn't required. You by default do not believe anything since you were born, you need a reason, a motivating thought to do something. ""Why not?"" is essentially a faulty argument because before you need a ""why not?"" you need a why. Why should I be on this computer typing to you? because I like to debate and want to debate my point of view, if I had absolutely NO reason at all to be on here, then it would be silly for me to be on here debating you. The question ""why shouldn't I?"" implies that there is a reason in the first place and there is simply no reason against it."	0

How would that mean 5 billion people would be killed? You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. Christ promised me that He has died in my place and that I will not be seen as guilty before God's throne: Christ took upon Himself my punishment, so that I may be seen as righteous! Terrible morality. You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? It is fair after all >:)	You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. And they will be destroyed in time. Terrible morality. How so? You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. When a Christian, the Holy Spirit enters and gives the Christian a new nature, a nature that fights sin and death. This nature is godly and only produces good fruit. It battles our sinful nature that only produces bad fruit. We learn from our mistakes, and as Paul said in Romans 7, we hate sin, but we do it anyways. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? I am incapable of saving anyone. So, I make myself a slave to everyone, though I am not a slave to anyone, in order to win as many as possible by the grace of God being shown through my life.	0
"The question is ""Is the problem of Evil a coherent argument against the existence of God(s)"". This does not say anything about a merciful or caring God. Merely the existence of a deity."	"The question is ""Is the problem of Evil a coherent argument against the existence of God(s)"". This does not say anything about a merciful or caring God. Merely the existence of a deity.  Right, but it follows with: In the philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is the question of how to explain evil if there exists a deity that is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient (see theism)."	0
"No it isn't. Lack of religion is not addressed. Here is the amendment as it is written ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right or the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" I too learned in school that the firs part read ""congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free practice thereof or lack thereof"" in fact if I wrote the first amendment down on a test and didn't add the ""lack thereof"" part it was counted wrong but when I looked it up I learned lack of religion isn't even addressed my civics teacher even admitted that."	That does not mean that the lack of religion has to be prohibited.	0

Diversity is not the cause of conflict. People or groups who do not accept or tolerate diversity can cause conflict between demograpghics. This is akin to stating that skin color is the cause of racism; the prejudice arose after the introduction of a difference, but it need not necessarily be that way. Diversity can certainly exist in the absence of conflict.  Communities composed of multiple ethnicities and cultures are perfectly capable of operating peacefully if no one is contrary to that goal. A diverse well of knowledge, backgrounds, and skills is better than a limited one. I am having trouble actually envisioning a situation in which diversity itself (not just the conflict that results from it) would be handicap. Maybe you can give an example.	Despite what people say in order to be perceived as politically correct, most people do no react well to diversity. People are naturally attracted to the company of those like themselves. If this is untrue then why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? Diversity IS the cause of conflict if the natural human reaction to it is a negative one, and I think it obviously is. Expecting people to embrace those that are different from themselves is expecting them to go against human nature. You say that diversity can exist in the absence of conflict, but can you name a diverse community or nation that does not have conflict between it's differing races or cultures? I would like to see an example of a harmonious, multicultural society.	0

Attempt to have sex with the unrestrained dog; if the dog doesn't run off or show signed of distress, I would say that proves that the dog is into it. Let's say we have a mute girl, who can't write or communicate via. hand language or whatever that's called. Then we have this man, who is deeply in love with her, but since she can't express her feelings for the man, he is going to have sex with her in front of the judge, to prove their love. That doesn't make sense to me, sorry.	So, if this mute girl squirms resists or runs away, you would conclude that she was not open to a sexual relationship? same as the dog. If, however she didn't resist, and seemed to enjoy it, being freely able to stop the attempt at sex at anytime, you would conclude she was good with it. this does not mean that every time a man wants to have sex with a mute girl he has to go through this process in front of a judge as you say. It would only take once, at most once per species, to establish that it is possible for an animal to be into a sexual relationship with a human.  The individual people who wanted to pursue such a relationship with an animal would be burdened with accessing the animal's receptiveness.  Now let me cut off your next argument. People would be just saying that the animal was into it and be performing animal abuse. This is an unfortunate fact about humanity, but is nothing new, people have raped other humans throughout history, this does not mean that we forbid consensual relationships between humans. why should an interspecies relationship be any different?	0

Well, it's a little annoying when you click on three debates on the home page and they all come up private! Or when you receive new activity that you can't respond to because it is also private... what the fuck is the point of alerting me to stuff I can't see or reply to?	The home page is the main attraction, but not the only attraction. If there private debates, these are only to make you mad by those losers. So, look into the archives and bring up an old debate. Activity brings it to the home page. These people are so entrenched with their beliefs that they ignore all others opinions and resort to childish bullshit.  Don't let them get into your skin.  This is why I try to ignore religion debates. Some will hold on to religion like some hold onto government such as iamdavidh. check out my new debate.	0
You advocate practices which lead to big business and fight policies that would be against their interests. Wrong, Laissez-faire policies encourages the elimination of big business by allowing more competitive markets emerge in all industries instead of oligopolies or monopolies.	Wrong, Laissez-faire policies encourages the elimination of big business by allowing more competitive markets emerge in all industries instead of oligopolies or monopolies. You're confusing the fact that a free market now would cut away regulations that favour current corporations and monopolies, encouraging new competition - with the simple fact that Laissez-faire/free market capitalism lead to those regulations in the first place. Free market capitalism must favour big businesses because they are better at satisfying demand, and those businesses will always use the easiest means to eliminate their competition, which usually means lobbying for regulations that favour them.	0

Of course time travel, in the fourth dimension, is possible. In fact you are traveling through time right now. And if by time travel you mean that you can control how you travel through time, you can do that too. Just go at 99.9% the speed of light. Actually, theoretically, (from special relativity and Stephen Hawking's books) you can travel into the future, but it is theoretically impossible to travel back in time. If you think about it, assuming that you know some of the principles of relativity, since everyone is traveling at different speeds and velocity in the first 3 dimensions relates to speed in the fourth dimension, time, everyone is a time traveler and everyone travels through time at different speeds.	I'm using it in the context that is, warping or manipulating the fourth dimension though.	0
Vampires are faster and can match that speed and still manipulate others and do much more disastrous things than the werewolves.	it is a mythological fact that in a race the werewolf will always win, the only advantage the vampire has is the ability to jump higher and move quieter.	0
"Then I assume you spend every waking hour wandering the streets thwarting crime, less you do nothing about it and thus be deserving of ""punishment"". Then again, it's not possible for you to do something about all crime, so it looks like you support criminals. ;)"	Let's be reasonable. To even imagine spending every waking moment is ludicrous. If I see a crime, I report it. Shoplifters, drunk drivers, reckless drivers, are among the list. Any unusual behavior, I check it out. If it appears to be of a criminal nature, I call the sheriff's office or the police. I get involved enough that I pursue suspects until help arrives.  To do any less than this is to promote crime. To do these things is the responsibility of every citizen. Crime affects all of us. The store charges more to cover the cost of theft. Drunk drivers may cause an accident or death. Do you really want them on road the same time as your family members and friends are? Reckless drivers are a hazard as well and maybe under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or have been involved in a crime. When I see a car run through four red lights, they get reported.  Yes, I've ended up face to face with a few. I had the tar scared out of me once, but I continue to do what is the right thing to do. I wasn't really expecting to find anybody inside the neighbors barn, when they where on vacation. A car appeared to be broke down and I called it in. Meanwhile I decided to make sure everything was in its place while waiting on the sheriff's duty to arrive, I now wait for them to arrive. Stumbled across two guys looking the place over. They ran and I ran the other direction, didn't like the odds. Still caught them anyway, I had their car boxed in.	0
It is not true, even in Communism. This is largely due to genetics. For most of us we don't suffer any noticeable problems, but there people suffering with handicaps they were born with.  If there is one thing that we should all be equal in, it is opportunity.

"On the Al Bundy question, I most certainly would not categorize them as fortunate and smart.  ""Victims"" of media portrayals of women are fortunate because they have killer looks that rake in big bucks, and smart because they use them to that end, preying on society's lust.  Al Bundy is not fortunate in the looks department, and so could not be smart in the same sense either."	But you're still missing the point. The point is that women as a class are degraded by media stereotyping. We could get into a long involved discussion of the ways in which media stereotyping creates a culture of abuse to which specific women are susceptible in various ways, but the crux is that media stereotyping of women is harmful to women as a group.	0
Maybe, but Kirk would do alien chics, even green ones! I mean, if the pussy is green it's got to be bad, right? But Kirk would dive right in there for the sake of diplomacy and establish a relationship with the alien species. He would get passed the smell and have it licked in no time ;) Kirk is the winner for having a nose for pussy and tapping it ;)	And then the human race contracts a new type of AIDS/Syphilis or something else that kills you.

I decided to look at a few of your other arguments but my god i wasnt expecting to find that you deny the reality of man made global wamring. Maybe trying to debate you isnt worth the time your obviously incapable of critical thinking if your arguing with the scientific consensus. I mean come on.Trying to relate the belief that the earth was the centre of the universe and the reality of global warming has one fundamental flaw that you obviously falied to notice. The world as it was then was dominated by religion and the vatican had decreed that the world was the centre of out universe. Today we have a society predicated on advancing science and technology (at least for the most part) and do you know why. Its precisely because society steeped in religion led to crazy beliefs that were later verified as being completely false. So you see your argument could equally be used against you. Again i have to reiterate, arguing with the scientific consensus is the hight of stupidity in my humble opinion.If you were diagnosed with cancer next week by 50 highly trained medical professionals but one decided it was a benign cist would you side with him and refuse treament, i very much doubt it. Well just think about how many scientists have accepted the reality of man made global warming ( and dont send back the argument that their all jumping on the band wagon science doesnt work that way and if you send that back you clearly know nothin about science) the ratio is orders of magnitude higher than 50:1.Peace out.	Lol!!!! So you think that the sun is NOT the major driving force of the weather ;) OMG! ;)	0
Hm. Well ninjas are pretty adept but they have their disadvantages. Firstly, numbers. Ninjas have to train and train and train and train in order to get to the position of skill they have. Pirates on the other hand have little to no skill and thus, have much larger numbers. Secondly, honor. Ninjas may be assassins but traditional ninjas still have a code of honor. Pirates don't. Pirates will cut your throat at the dinner table if you make a bad comment. Thirdly, pirates cheat. Always. If you think you're in a fair fight with a pirate you're probably about to get a big surprise in the form of a hand cannon to the back by his buddy.	"I have to shine some fact on your second and third arguments:     ninjas didn't have ""bushido"", the constraining code of honour that the samurai had. they only learned bushido so they could use it against their ancient enemy. The only loyalty or honour a ninja has is to his family and clan. when he's fighting all bets are off.  secondly, ninjas do nothing but find ""new and innovative"" ways of destroying their opponent (read: they played dirty) there's a move in ninjutsu known as ""monkey steals the peach"" that ends with the enemy bleeding profusely from the place his manhood used to be. now that's below that belt :P"	0
If you don't understand him, why bother loving him then? Because if you can't understand him, it is rash to say he loves us.	No, it isn't. We don't understand His ways, or the reason why He does what He does - but one thing He has made clear and that all believers understand is His love for us. Did you ever understand your parents' reasons for making the decisions they did? If not, did you still love them anyway? It's a simple concept, really.	0
What's funny is I think this is beginning to sound like conservative bias! If she wins, which I don't think she will. I already told you that I am not conservative. I'm trying to convince you to be unbiased. If you were a conservative trash-talking all liberals, then I'd still be arguing with you. I don't think Clinton will win. I never said that I don't want her to win... even though I don't. the Republicans have nowhere to go in 2016 unless they get somebody like Rubio to oppose somebody other than Clinton. Obama's final term will be the deciding factor. So far it doesn't look good for the Democrat's.   Also if Bill won I don't see how his wife can't I never said she can't, I just don't think she will. If she does win, it won't be because of who her husband is. As for my thoughts on Obama As I had said before Obama was a disappointment but he still did great things for the country, the affordable health care act was passed under him making him the first president to pass a law for universal health care. Obamacare is a bunch of shit. It's cons outweigh it's pros. He ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama Bin Laden. The war wasn't with Iraq, it's with Al Qaeda. We no longer have a military presence in Iraq, but we're still in the Middle East. Turn on the news, we're going to war with Syria! So now we are not only at war with Al Qaeda... but Syria as well. He didn't end a war, he added one. And he passed the dream act. Education for illegal immigrants? Yeah, that was real important... The debt is beginning to drip as well. The debt has increased by more than $6 Trillion dollars since he took office his second term. It is the largest debt increase under any President.	I already told that I am no conservative.  Doesn't mean this is not really conservative propaganda. Obamacare is a pile of shit. It's cons outweigh it's pros. Oh so tell me why it is so shitty and tell me how its cons outweigh the pros. He did not end a war, he added one.  Again he ended the war in Iraq just because we are going to war with Syria doesn't mean we did not end the war in Iraq. The debt has increased by more than $6 Trillion dollars since he took office. It is the largest debt increase under any president. Bush increased the debt by 105% he doubled the debt. And also the debt has been dropping since 2012.	0

The intellectual construct that comprises one's ruling logic. The problematic words here are intellectual and logic. God is neither an intellectual creation of the human mind nor a logical conclusion.	"God is neither an intellectual creation of the human mind nor a logical conclusion.

"You seem to have omitted a number of concepts in your argument: 1. If a god is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, then evil cannot exist. On the contrary, evil can exist. I fail to recall at any place in the bible where it says God is the Universe's police officer. He is the judge, when the evil doers have passed on, God will judge those individuals and punish them. He will not stop them, nor does it say anywhere in the bible that he will. 2. If evil exists, said god could not exist. If evil exists, it is the product of the free will endowed on humanity, not by ""choice"" of God. God gave humanity free will and the ability to choose; if humans decide to choose evil, (hypothetically) God will not stop them, he will simply punish them once they have passed on."	1. You failed to considered the meaning of omnibenevolent, and what that means when combined with the two other properties. The bible is irrelevant to the logic of combining those three properties.  2. Free will is an absurd concept. Further more, punishment for such things(especially the type god is typically said to enforce) is not an act of a Omnibenevolent god.	0

How does change help society when it was apparently working before?	Just consider now, in this day and age, if nothing ever changed. All the hell of wall street meltdowns coming every 5-8 years, unemployment still low, environment going down the drain, not to forget a war. There is a time to conserve and a time to change. I believe now is the latter. I completely understand the conservative mind set, but something has to stray our course.	0

This is written in a manner which leads me to believe that you do not believe in the existence of free will. Ok. But does free will necessarily exist? I haven't made a judgement either way, but it seems to me that you have given no arguments for this premise to be valid. Why couldn't God violate an individual's free will to make a point? But is there a good argument for God to violate an individual's free will?	"Ok. But does free will necessarily exist? No. Does evil necessarily exist? All that we perceive as being ""evil"" may be only less good than all that we perceive as being ""good"". I haven't made a judgement either way, but it seems to me that you have given no arguments for this premise to be valid. Free will cannot be proved; nor can it be disproved. But is there a good argument for God to violate an individual's free will? I'm not God; I can't say for sure, but I don't think for I am a human who values what I perceive as being free will."	0
"The more you employ the less you work, so let's throw out that ""we earned it"" argument.  With all of the unemployment in America, it's statements like these that are really dumb. With the Democrats proposed system, the more you employ, the less you get to keep, the more you have to make the workers you hire work, or hire less. There is no incentive to starting a business, which I assure you is not an easy task. Think on the level of someone who wants to hire less than 50 people, the small businesses."	With all of the unemployment in America, it's statements like these that are really dumb. Right, moving right along. With the Democrats proposed system, the more you employ, the less you get to keep ...because more people are doing your job. the more you have to make the workers you hire work, More employees = more individual workload? I'm willing to completely disagree with you on that one. The more people you have working for you, the more you can get done with less individual workload, i.e. the whole premise of employment.  or hire less. Hire less if your business can't afford it? Well then maybe the problem is the shitty business. There is no incentive to starting a business Profit. which I assure you is not an easy task Agreed. - The thing is that an owner expects a personal salary parabolic to their workers, and succeeds in doing so by paying them less. If profit weren't the main incentive, but rather maximal benefit, then the wages between the worker and the owner would be much closer, and the excess profit would go back into improving the business. I've worked for small businesses before, and yes they are a lot of work, but not just for the owner. For every employee. In fact the few small business owners I've worked for really just managed the hiring and payroll.	0
I love Him dearly, but I feel cheated. I am not happy and I believe that I deserve happiness. ;'(	Fantastic, well you may not get much help from me being an atheist, but are you genuinely surprised? You thought God was going to take special care of you? Look at the world, it's far from a perfect place, why should you receive perfect treatment. I know from your point of view, life has always been all about you, other people (including me now) are just other things, but the exact same experience your having of life is being experienced by billions of others. So why should you in particular be looked after. God is not a perfect being, ever since mankind was created he has been maltreating us horrendously! You want happiness? You want to live a full happy life? Stop worrying about God all the time, I am not saying denounce your faith, I very much doubt that would happen, just stop worrying about what you don't have and start considering what you do. Now, that's about as pretentious I can get without bursting in to a rage why God is not real, and if he did he would be the biggest mass murdering villain ever yadda yadda yadda. Way I see it, you're not happy now, but later on if you re-read this you'll probably laugh at how silly you sound, or feel ashamed at how you were parading your problems on the internet. By then whatever you feel sad about will have passed. Oh well, that's a little of what I think, but you don't have to listen :D	0

That would be like saying humans are equal to God. There are very few cases when the creation is superior or equal to the creator.	Could that be an advantage then? There's already paranoid thoughts of robots being the successors to the human race so wouldn't their more logical, just enough emotion to matter, perspective make them better evolutionary candidates. They'll have the best of mankind- perhaps even better than the best- with less of our undesirable qualities. They'll care but not enough for it to overtly influence their logical choices. On a purely philosophical note though: God gave us free will so should we do the same for the robots?	0
So everything that doesnt agree with your set of standards has a bias?  Well, obviously. i know a lot of media in our country is liberal, but it seems as though every conservative claims EVERYTHING has a liberal bias, what about all the scientist in the world who agree with liberals on climate change, do they have a liberal bias? Haven't I told you before that I'm not really Conservative (well, not that much)? I just got annoyed seeing all of the Liberal bullshit on here and I felt like I needed to defend the Republicans. I think Fox News is full of shit a good portion of the time and so are the Liberal news agencies, who just so happen to outnumber the conservative channels by A LOT. I agree with Conservatives on some things and I agree with Liberals on some things... where does that put my bias? There's a difference between clear logic and opinion. Some parties clearly have certain things right.	"It seems like you've made this debate to be a republican apologist. I can't stand either party.

"""You're the one trying to close the discussion, not me."" It's a fruitless effort to continue a discussion with someone who continuously counteracts everything I say. I'm not saying you should agree - nay, this is the point of debate. However, you could disagree in a non-condescending manner. I can't tell you why God does some of the things He does, which goes back to me saying previously that we don't understand His ways. We aren't meant to. That's why he's God. He gave us all free-will, the choice to believe or not believe. ""You're pulling the religious faith card, which puts you firmly in the box."" Christians cannot answer this question without telling you about their faith. The two go hand in hand. In my first response, I said I saw how that connection might be made, thus I saw your point of view. That does not put me ""firmly in the box."" ""You can answer yes, and still be a Christian."" Again, I said I saw where the connection could be made. But Christianity is not sadomasochism. You're saying that love and fear go hand in hand in Christianity. We don't love him because we fear him. We love him because we love him. We respect him because we fear him. Fear is a natural response from any creation in regards to their creator."	 However, you could disagree in a non-condescending manner. What have I said that is condescending? I can't tell you why God does some of the things He does, which goes back to me saying previously that we don't understand His ways.  From what I can tell, and this is not personal, that just seems to be a typical response when God's authority and nature is challenged. God does something good: he is loving, kind, omnibenevolent, etc. God does something bad: he works in mysterious ways, we can't know his true nature, etc. Just how I see it. He gave us all free-will, the choice to believe or not believe. Sadomasochism can be consensual. We don't love him because we fear him. We love him because we love him. We respect him because we fear him. Fear is a natural response from any creation in regards to their creator. OK. But is fear the natural response? How are we supposed to know that?	0

"Really, attacking me on my username? You can't be serious. ""If one isn't for something than they must be against it."" Wouldn't you think that this argument is way too simplistic? Just because someone does not take part in an anti-smoking campaign does not automatically make him a supporter of smoking. Just because one does not go out of the way to intervene in a crime in action does not mean he condones it.  Other considerations must be made: the risks of his involvement, the necessity of involvement are but 2 of the factors that may deter someone from interference. ""You do not wish to deter crime and so you must support it."" Again, way too simplistic an argument. That's akin to saying just because someone is not good therefore he is evil. You are placing people on extreme sides based on a single action (or lack thereof) without considering the possible repercussions of interference on the bystanders at all."

"Oh, I understand them very much so. Ok, let me explain something to you, humans have this thing called empathy. That means when somebody suffers, you feel sorry. Now, if this was one or a few people, I might understand your position When we're talking about 60% of humanity, including people you know, and you fully came to terms with the implications. You would be INCREDIBLY saddened. You could have a crisis of faith, depression, whatever. But, you are saying that you have come to terms with that. I must conclude 1 of 2 things 1: You are emotional zombie who feels little to no remorse or (the more likely one) 2: You have not come to terms with it Before you say ""but I have come to terms with it and I do feel sad"" please refer to what I said above You would no be defending this stance as morally justifiable, or claim you understand it. The last thing you would do is go on a site to argue with other people, when it obvious your mind is more sealed than an airlock."	When we're talking about 60% of humanity, including people you know, and you fully came to terms with the implications. You would be INCREDIBLY saddened. Oh, its greater than 60%. 1/3 of the world's population are professing Christians. Many who profess are not Christians at all. And Jesus said clearly, many times, that the gate and road are narrow, which lead to eternal life, while the road to destruction is wide. My mother and my grandmother are non-Christian. My dad is not an active Christian. Many of my friends are non-Christians. And this saddens me very much so. I pray all the time for my mother and grandmother to be saved. And I have hope that they will be saved in God's time, whether that be now or some time in the future.  You would no be defending this stance as morally justifiable, or claim you understand it. Simply because I am saddened extremely and have come to terms with it, it does not mean that I must think it immoral. I think it true, absolutely, and I can't not believe it; I have no where to turn, as Peter says in John 6, since there's no point in life past Christianity, which is a thing that only Christians have come to realize. I literally cannot deny Christ, and am incapable of it, not out of fear, but out of a conviction that bears deep within my bones. The Holy Spirit has made its refuge within my life, and it will not let me go. I cannot leave, and I don't want to leave. I am saddened by it, very much so. I understand Christianity very much so. I think it moral, very much so. I am saddened by the fact that my mother and grandmother are not moral, and deserve death, but will not accept the generosity of Christ, thus, making them debtors to death. I hate this fact, but I cling to God.	0

I don't agree with the violence of war. However, i believe war do have a point. It is like a violent protest in such a way. We don't go into war without reason. Well, i don't have knowledge about the past wars but today wars are started to protect America. Well, that is what i believe.  I understand your comment. However, what if war was unavoidable? That your opponents are barbaric enough not to reason. Is racism plus patriotism THEN a good thing? in your opinion.  I would say yes if and only if, the person was smart enough to manipulate his emotion to give him or herself confidence. Tho i wouldn't suggest it to people who would eventually carry on through the rest of their lives. upvote. The reason is mainly because i agree with most of your argument. Tho giving someone an upvote is pointless because it is basically implying that i agree with you totally. I don't completely because, like i said, i do think war has a reason. I just thought i should give you a reason for giving you an upvote. :)	However, i believe war do have a point Actually you are correct, but the points of war are very very stupid. If you want to kill innocent people over: land, religion, 'revenge', resources... these are all solvable through peace and tranquility, no killing of innocent people required. Also, we did not go to war 'against terrorism' in multiple Middle Eastern countries to protect ourselves. We had very brief moment of weakness and were subjugated to an act of terrorism by a foreign religion. It's happened dozens of times in our history... except before, it wasn't committed by some wishy-washy religious organization. Big deal? It's not an excuse to kill millions of innocent people. However, what if war was unavoidable? That your opponents are barbaric enough not to reason. Is racism plus patriotism THEN a good thing? in your opinion. If their barbarism threatens your innocent people, then that is about the only time war is a good idea. Unfortunately, war hasn't been fought over such a black-and-white subject at LEAST since World War II! I would say yes if and only if, the person was smart enough to manipulate his emotion to give him or herself confidence. If a person does this, then they aren't truly racist or overly-patriotic.	0
1. Disproving evolution does not Prove Intelligent design Have you ever taken geometry? A lot of it is using logic to prove things. But sometimes it's impossible to prove something head-on. You have to take the counter-proof and try to prove the opposite, see that this is impossible, and then use that to prove the first thing from a side angle. There's also this ideology: If there are two solutions, and one is proved to be false, than the other, no matter how unlikely, has to be true. So, yes, disproving Evolution does prove ID. 2. Disproving Evolution does not prove God If it is eventually proved that live couldn't evolve on Earth, that it was 'designed' or maybe even seeded here by an alien something, than you're just pushing the origin of life to some other planet. But if life couldn't evolve on Earth, than it most likely couldn't evolve elsewhere, which means there has to be a god (in this case, God) that created it. 3. A lack of vestigial organs (if there was) in humans does not disprove evolution How not? Evolution is so complete and so perfect that there are no leftovers? It seems there should be something that serves absolutely no purpose, and thus, does not benefit survival nor not benefit survival, and, thus, it'd still be around.  4. Living transitional species do not disprove evolution. Not by itself, but it would seem logical that there would be certain things still evolving into other things. (Not that I think something evolves from a horse to a giraffe, but that they should be going from fish to amphibian, amphibian to reptile, reptile to bird, etc.) But we see none. 5. Complexity does not equate with 'design' Complexity on such a scale as life usually equates with design. Modern computers (even the very first computers) are massively complex, and have been designed. Watches are complex, and are designed. You can even tell an arrowhead, which is very simple, has been designed and created. When archaeologists find an ancient pot, they assume somebody designed it; they do not speculate what type of asteroid-lightning combination would be needed to form such a thing. 6. You must prove there there is a designer before you can assert anything as it's design; which is the opposite of what you are trying to do. If you prove it's designed, you imply a designer. 8. Humans actually do have a few minor vestigial structures. All the present 'vestigial structures' either have functions (e.g. the appendix) or can be explained via Creationism (e.g. the ear muscles, wisdom teeth, etc.) After sin entered the world, and the world's systems began to decay, I would expect some things to loose their function, like the ear muscles. Wisdom teeth can be explained thus: God made all things vegetarian in His perfect world. We have since lost that vegetarianism, and, thus, lost the benefits of wisdom teeth.	Have you ever taken geometry? A lot of it is using logic to prove things. But sometimes it's impossible to prove something head-on. You have to take the counter-proof and try to prove the opposite, see that this is impossible, and then use that to prove the first thing from a side angle. There's also this ideology: If there are two solutions, and one is proved to be false, than the other, no matter how unlikely, has to be true. This is called a false dichotomy, your argument assumes that there are only two possible explanations. If we are to include yet undiscovered scientific possibilities, and supernatural explanations, there could be potentially any number of explanations. If it is eventually proved that live couldn't evolve on Earth, that it was 'designed' or maybe even seeded here by an alien something, than you're just pushing the origin of life to some other planet. But if life couldn't evolve on Earth, than it most likely couldn't evolve elsewhere, which means there has to be a god (in this case, God) that created it. See above explanation.  How not? Evolution is so complete and so perfect that there are no leftovers? It is not impossible. Just unlikely. And as I have stated, we actually do have vestigial structures. Not by itself, but it would seem logical that there would be certain things still evolving into other things.  In an environment which changes very little (ex: ocean trenches) it is possible that an organism that is perfectly adapted to such an environment will have changed very little over millions of years. Complexity on such a scale as life usually equates with design. Usually? Compared to what? This implies you know other other instances of complex life besides that of earth. Modern computers (even the very first computers) are massively complex, and have been designed. Watches are complex, and are designed. You can even tell an arrowhead, which is very simple, has been designed and created. And we know these things are designed because we have designed them. There are many non-complex things which are designed, like the arrow head, showing us that complexity does not equate with design. If you prove it's designed, you imply a designer. To prove something is designed you must FIRST prove it has a designer.  All the present 'vestigial structures' either have functions (e.g. the appendix) Something having a purpose, doesn't make it NOT a vestigial structure. Vestigial structures can be re-purposed to fit new circumstances. For example, the whales hip bone can be used to aid in birthing calfs, but only somebody in intense denial would argue that a hip bone was never used to support a hip.  or can be explained via Creationism (e.g. the ear muscles, wisdom teeth, etc.) After sin entered the world, and the world's systems began to decay, I would expect some things to loose their function, like the ear muscles. Invoking the supernatural will not help your argument.  Wisdom teeth can be explained thus: God made all things vegetarian in His perfect world. We have since lost that vegetarianism, and, thus, lost the benefits of wisdom teeth. Perhaps in your fantasy world, but in reality Tyrannosaurus Rex did not have huge powerful jaws full of razor sharp teeth to eat grass. This is an assertion of the greatest hilarity.	0

"I do not believe in friendship between boy and girl, because it is something else, however it is not friendship. As everybody I have own experience about it. Firstly when we are meeting future ""friends"" among opposite sex, we know exactly that she/he attracts us as ""future girlfriend or boyfriend"" or does not. So I have many good familiar among girls, but you call them ""friends"". In my situations I attract them, they attract me, but the end is one if you are not a sweet couple, you will not communicate with them as with friends among your gender. I have one very good familiar among girls, we are ""friends"", but you can not compare it with friendship, it is different things. We do not remember them often, we just talking with them when we are meeting them or when we do not have enough attention of opposite sex))"	Did not you think that it mey be a different type of friendship?	0

"""Cheating on a test? That is bad for a good reason. That means he's not learning and he's using other people's work without doing the work himself... Being gay has no negative."" Actually, being gay has many negative consequences... 60% of male homosexuals had more than 250 lifetime sexual partners... 28% had more than 1000 lifetime sexual partners.... and 79% admitted that more than half of their sexual partners were strangers (The Institution for Sex Research; Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). ""The average AIDS victim has had 60 different sexual partners in the past twelve months... the average heterosexual male has - throughout his life - from five to nine sex partners"" (Dr. William Foege, Director of the Centers for Disease Control). ""Yvonne Zipter, a lesbian writing in Chicago's gay journal Windy City Times, in an article entitled ""The Disposable Lesbian Relationship,"" notes that the ""lasting lesbian relationship"" is a ""mythic entity"" (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). The current figure is that 70% of Americans with  AIDS are male homosexuals or bisexuals. Dr. Bernard J. Klamecki, says that 86% of homosexual males use various drugs to enhance and increase their sexual stimulation. The homosexual is also 3 times more suicidal than heterosexuals. The life expectancy for gays wihtout AIDS is 33 years shorter than hetersexuals.... etc. (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 148). The life style of gays is not a safe one.... I'm sorry, but you are wrong... ---------- And yes, I believe the Bible, so I follow the Bible. If God is real the He is the one to decide what is good and bad... not us!"	Even if the statistics applied to all homosexuals (i.e. if a homosexual was incapable of using proper protection, had a low number of partners, etc.), is it more harmful to embrace your sexuality (though it may cause harm [but, then, so does heterosexuality]) or to repress it? Either way living a more dangerous lifestyle doesn't make it inherently wrong. It's a choice. My lifestyle involves me driving a lot, which makes me more statistically likely to be killed or maimed in an auto accident... are lifestyles that involve cars inherently wrong?  And I think it's funny you would mention suicide as a reason not to be homosexual, when it's largely the fault of an intolerant heterosexual community that drives gays to suicide. According the the FBI there were more hate crimes against gays in America than there were against every single religious denomination (and atheists) combined. Transsexuals and cross-dressers are denied housing and employment on a regular basis for being true to who they are by intolerant bigots. Being shunned and rejected from society is the cause of much homosexual suicide; homosexuals living a lifestyle they enjoy is not the cause of homosexual suicide.  Also... are you pulling your facts from the Christian Research Institute? Their goals are laughably contradictory to their supposed methods. Not exactly unbiased.	0

no, wearing a burqa should't be banned, although it should not be imposed on women who do not wish to wear it. The point of banning the veil is to prevent the husbands and fathers from forcing their wives and daughters to wear it. wearing a veil comes in customs of the Muslims, and the govt. should not interfere with religious rights of people... Religions are not granted special treatment however. They may follow rituals and customs as long as these do not harm a person's dignity, liberty, or body. banning on burqa or veils will mean interference on people to follow religious rights. The right of a woman to not be treated as second class in her community because of a cultural obligation to hide her presence from society is more important than that.	The point of banning the veil is to prevent the husbands and fathers from forcing their wives and daughters to wear it. that's what we don't want...we want women to wear burqas only when they want it...

It matters on how they want their religion to be...If they want to wear burqas, and we ban them...is that not exploitation of their liberty??	0
The age of consent is necessary to prevent adults from taking sexual advantage of children. A well-known form of ephebophilia is the 'Teacher-student' romance. Either the teacher or the student seduces the other - which results in a sexual relationship that has been known to evolve into marriage. An example from popular culture would be the critically acclaimed film 'Notes on a Scandal'.	"""The age of consent is necessary to prevent adults from taking sexual advantage of children."" I believe this is why concepts like statutory rape exist, however. Age of consent is hardly necessary between two people of the same or similar ages however. In truth I believe that age limits on sex exist because most parents, indeed many adults seem to have a uncomfortable feeling when discussing or contemplating the subject of teenagers having sex with each other."	0
Well theres different kinds of agnostics. One kind just doesnt know if a God exists. The other thinks that knowledge of God is unknowable by anybody.

So you have evidence that clearly states there is no God ?	0
If you believe in Global Warming then you are as egotistical as the people who believed that humans were at the center of the universe. You are a sun denier that thinks that humans have a greater effect on our weather than the sun. ;)	I decided to look at a few of your other arguments but my god i wasnt expecting to find that you deny the reality of man made global wamring. Maybe trying to debate you isnt worth the time your obviously incapable of critical thinking if your arguing with the scientific consensus. I mean come on.Trying to relate the belief that the earth was the centre of the universe and the reality of global warming has one fundamental flaw that you obviously falied to notice. The world as it was then was dominated by religion and the vatican had decreed that the world was the centre of out universe. Today we have a society predicated on advancing science and technology (at least for the most part) and do you know why. Its precisely because society steeped in religion led to crazy beliefs that were later verified as being completely false. So you see your argument could equally be used against you. Again i have to reiterate, arguing with the scientific consensus is the hight of stupidity in my humble opinion.If you were diagnosed with cancer next week by 50 highly trained medical professionals but one decided it was a benign cist would you side with him and refuse treament, i very much doubt it. Well just think about how many scientists have accepted the reality of man made global warming ( and dont send back the argument that their all jumping on the band wagon science doesnt work that way and if you send that back you clearly know nothin about science) the ratio is orders of magnitude higher than 50:1.Peace out.	0

"Trying to redefine a term to mean something it doesn't is not an improvement. Sometimes a words meaning is confused by a poorly written definition. When someone is asymptomatic, we don't say they lack a belief in symptoms, when someone is apolitical we don't say they lack a belief in politics, when someone is asexual this doesn't mean they don't believe in sex. Some atheists may understand very well the reality of what gods are and believe gods exist AS psycho-socially constructed absolute authority figures. They understand they exist, but don't personally regard any of them to be worthy of worship, that's what makes them atheist.  It would seem simple to categorize theists as those who regard one or more beings as being worthy of worship, and atheists as those who don't regard any beings to be worthy of worship. Not all atheists are SO metaphorically challenged that we don't know what the word god refers to in reality. Theists worship their gods and anti-theists speak up about the worst gods they know of saying ""certainly gods such as these aren't worthy of worship"". Some atheists aren't philosophically opposed to the worshiping of gods like the anti-theist variety atheists are, and even entertain the possibilty of themselves worshiping a god should they themselves become aware of one they find to be worthy.  The term atheist comes from the Greek ""a theos"", literally ""without gods"". It is just any person who lacks a belief in deities. End of list. The term cannot be understood without knowing what a god is. One cannot know what a god is, without believing they exist at least in some manner."	"This whole mess is pure sophistry.  For starters, the reason you don't say people who are asymptomatic, apolitical, and asexual don't believe in those things is because those root words aren't about belief. A person who is asymptomatic lacks symptoms, just like a person who is an atheist lacks theism.  Second, if an person believes a god exists, he or she isn't an atheist BY DEFINITION. Theism doesn't require WORSHIP of said gods- just belief in one or more. And trying to claim that existing only in the minds of believers counts as the existence of a god is so nonsensical as to be dismissed- it's you trying to redefine terms to suit yourself. Third, anti-theists aren't necessarily atheists to start. Many believe in gods and just don't find them worthy of worship- that means they aren't atheist.  Fourth, it is nonsensical in the extreme to claim that one cannot be an atheist unless one believes a god exists ""in some manner"". You are again trying to pretend that imaginary is somehow equivalent to existence. Your false equivocation fallacy- trying to exchange two different meanings of the word ""exist"" as though they are the same- is obvious to anyone."	0
"""Vampires, are known for their superhuman agility, speed, balance, and tracking people or things according to their scent They also have the ability to hypnotize their victims with their mesmerizing eyes, which will at times flash in a golden or silver tone, depending on their mood. They can fly for a limited period, as long as it is night in their human form. If they are in their bat form, they can fly relatively longer in exchange for their increased vulnerability to sunlight. Speaking of transforming into bats, they can transform into any creature they wise, but it has to be real. (No imaginary stuff, well, maybe a dragon.) Since they are the living-dead, they can survive without having to eat food or water, although they can eat to blend into society. They can stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, because they don't need to breathe. More powerful vampires can control the weather, so vampire hunters usually target areas where there has been much unusual cloudy or foggy days/nights. They can be inflicted with a small/large amount of damage, but they need human blood to replenish themselves if the damage is large. If it is like a small cut, it can be healed fast by itself. Vampires can live on animal blood instead of human. They also don't age until after a few centuries. This can be prevented by drinking a baby's blood, which is known for their regenerative properties.

He's great at leaving American ambasoters to die, he's great at passing unpopular laws, he's great at raising both our taxes and our national debt at the same time and he's really REALLY great ant not creating any new jobs at all	Your post is a lie. Hes fought hard to get bills passed to get the poorest 50 million healthcare , even those with pre-existing conditions. this is the bets and most moral bill in american history. it was mainly unpopular with the mega rich corporations who own many news networks and used this and their power to destroy the bill. but justice prevailed and obama fought for one of the bravest bills in american history. americans die 10 years younger than some other poorer nations, obama wants to change this. what a phenomenally brave bill to fight for in the midst of the biggest recession in 80 years other unpopular bills include the slow closure of guantanamo bay, the allowance of stem cell research, the saving of the auto industry, the billions of dollars rightly fining of massive corporate corruption, the investment in infrastructure and roads , the nuclear disarmourment programmes etc hes toppled 100s of terrorists and terrorists leaders, hes ended the iraq war and afghanistan to follow hes only raised taxes on the richest americans, which is morally right, especially as the american stock market has doubled in value under obama so corporate profits are up, they should pay more and hes also closed some of the endless tax loopholes for millionaires he HAS created over 5 million jobs in the past 3 years...the debt to gdp ratio has fallen from 3.59 to 3.26 a big fall....hes slashed millitary state spending by 2 trillion compared to the republicans..hes grown the economy steadily for 3 years, hes creatred the majority of new jobs in small to medium businesses...hes delayed debt repayment whilst america grows faster than all of europe , so now its strongf enough to afford some tax rises to pay off debt....hiw quality overseas leadership has meant he will also same trillions on military which will reduce the debts too hes also slashed 500,000 government jobs to create pver 5 million private, so hes also no socialist. hes middle of the road and balanced. unemployment has fallen steadily since bush from 10.5% to 7.7% this has been steady but its all long term with obama his legacy will last a 100 years	0
If one has been given free will to act in a manner we would deem to be either good or evil, then he could conceivably commit acts which we view as being evil. The Problem of Evil precludes free will.	But why would a god give its subjects free will only to punish them if they use it? The entire point of religions like Islam and Christianity is submission. God doesn't want you to have free will. He wants you to act how he tells you to act. Why then would he even give his subjects free will? Either way, the idea of this kind of a god refutes itself.	0

"Are you saying most or even all disabled persons are miserable and a ""hassel""? Not only is that monumentally offensive, it's untrue. If you are basing this on the fact that you would be miserable if you had a disability, then that is a sign of your own weak character but in no way a reflection on others.  There is a lovely little girl who comes to my dog park with her father. She doesn't have a dog, but just comes to play. She has a myriad of disorders, and will have to be cared for her entire life. But, she is happy. Her father is happy. And I could not imagine her ever saying, gosh I wish I had never been born. I happen to think that proportionally, there are more depressed ""normal"" people than disabled. The character of a disabled person is truly amazing, and is probably a direct result of their trials. Being strong is not needing help. No, that's being stubborn and lonely. Again, what's your definition of happiness?"	Ah, yes, the view that Ignorance is Bliss. Unfortunately, it's only bliss for those who have it. For the people surrounding them, it is annoying. And what about physical handicaps? Are you saying they wouldn't be any happier without them?

Beastiality is sick, they can't tell you whether they want it or not its forces onto them it is rape and they can do nothing to stop it if they dislike it. There was a story in my town of a man who pretty much raped a dog, his wife walked in on him doing so and could tell that the dog didn't want this. Beastiality is animal rape because they cannot give consent to it and it is forced on then not only that it is an act of cruelty that should never be allowed. If you rape an animal because you don't have a woman or something go find a woman/man to have sex with instead at least the it's not rape and you won't get fined/arrested.	I have to dispute this. Sex with an animal isn't rape for the same reason that killing an animal isn't murder. If an aroused animal mounts an unwilling, possibly restrained human, that isn't rape either. If an animal kills a human, that isn't murder either. Rape and murder are both terms specific to conscious human actions against other humans. There are a number of good reasons that beastiality should not be indulged in, enough to warrant laws against it in my opinion- but rape it is not.	0

"The idea they do not want people educated is lunatic right-wing retardedness. Right wingers never said ""we don't want educated people!"" they just said ""get government out of education and allow for the market to take over, the true competition will drive quality up and prices down, then education gets better."" Wanting to force people to pay for state education with low quality teachers and indoctrinating history classes is retarded."	Indoctrinating history classes? That only exists in the south. The rest of the U.S. teaches actual history. And public school is less expensive per person, and free to those who cannot afford it, and tests show that there is actually no consistent evidence that private expensive schools offer a better education than the less expensive to free public ones. The students from the demographic groups that do well in private schools, perform equally in public schools. Advocating allowing the markets to determine education is advocating pricing those who are not rich not get an education, or what education they can get teaches them stuff like how to polish rich people's shoes who's parents could afford a real school.	0

"Ha our country was formed through revolution. And America isn't a democracy we are a republic which means the majority cannot take away individual rights and freedom no matter what. And if they are the minority has the right to fight back its like Ben Franklin once said ""democracy is tow wolves and a lamb discussing what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote."	"Note: 'by the minority' in the case of the US revolution was the justification precisely that laws were being enforced without the consent of the majority? ""No taxation without etc....""  In this instance if gun laws are brought in by a duly elected president it is by the majority, if the minority try to overturn the majority it is undemocratic, if they do so violently it is traitorous. And Churchill said ""democracy is the worst possible form of government, except all other forms that have been tried"" Both Churchill and Franklin were democrats (small d). Democracy and republic are not mutually exclusive, you are both, just as we are both a democracy and a constitutional monarchy."	0
Crops and plants may now have feelings but the pig whose intestines are genetically altered does have feelings and it is not okay for us to cause pain to an animal for our own benefit.	I agree that it is ethically wrong to cause pain to animals. However, it is important to note the benefits of transgenic organisms. For example, certain genetically altered cows produce milk that is protein enriched and can be beneficial to the elderly or young children who need boosts in protein. Also many genetically altered animals feel no pain at all and can live perfectly normal lives without pain or suffering.  Products such as blood anti-clotting milk will soon be available and will be a breakthrough in medical science as it will save thousands of lives. Also genetic diseases that can be extremely painful to humans can be treated due to advancements in gene therapy, which allows for a gene to be implanted into a human genome to counteract or replace a defective gene. This can be a huge savoir to people who suffer from diseases that interrupt their everyday life. Overall I think if we use genetic advancements on animals with caution and care, we can create benefits for humans that do not harm animals or plants.	0
Well, I don't think Atheism doesn't make sense. It makes sense on a level, where it is perfectly human to demand proof of existence of higher powers of any kinds. It is perfectly human to not believe what you don't have sensible contacts with. But when you think of that they think that everything we see, the beautiful trees in the garden, and the enormous universe with the most beautiful galaxies are made from nothing - that makes no sense to me. Please don't dispute me with: It didn't come from nothing, it came from big bang. Because then I'll just ask you where big bang came from - and it did come from nothing, if you don't have another explanation. Pre-existence and blablabla - those are just excuses you make up, to hide the fact, that your beliefs are just as crazy as mine.	So you believe that something can not come from nothing, no? Thus, who/what created God?	0

Again, evolution is still happening. You did not tell me why you think it is not. Evolution is not 'trying' to get any species to do anything. It's not random but it doesn't want all reptiles to fly or all primates to turn into homo sapiens. If reptiles are perfectly capable of finding food on the ground, why would they do anything except for hone adaptations that help them do that more efficiently? Species change in response to their environments. The less an environment changes, the less creatures who utilize that environment are likely to change as well.	Again, evolution is still happening. You did not tell me why you think it is not. Because I think that DNA is too limited to change the basic body shape of a creature. I believe there has to be more to the Cambrian Explosion than random DNA mutations. An interesting experiment would be to put cat DNA into a dog egg cell (like cloning, but not sticking with the same species). Would the baby be a cat or a dog? Or would it fail because it was trying to put cat DNA into a dog? A more interesting one would be to put avian DNA into a dog egg cell, or even spider or fish DNA. See what happens. If DNA were truly the cause of body shape, the dog (or test tube) would give birth to a cat, bird, spider, and fish respectively. If not, than you'd end up with a bunch of aborted dog fetuses.	0

I think everyone deserves medical attention regardless of the situation and the details of essential medical attention. I know it seems unfair to allow medical attention for everyone when everyone can't pay it or in this debate it is being highlighted that it is the fault of the person. If the person can pay for it, then yes they should have to pay for it, but if they can't I don't think we should just disallow it to them. This is why I think a good health care system may be necessary, I know other countries do it and the people don't have that big of a problem with it so why can't we? The health care system we have right now is not high quality sure, but it could be. We are a civilization, and thus we should act like, just like an adult should act like an adult. Does it seem civilized to allow poor people, or maybe in the moment stupid people to just die, when something can be done? no it doesn't to me. Sure maybe we haven't figured out the fairest way to go about it, but we should go about letting everyone have medical attention when they really need it. With smoking however, we can't determine the sole and primary cause of any form of cancer being that of smoking, and the truth is we are all going to need medical attention because of our own decisions. We don't eat healthy, do extremely obese people deserve any medical attention? Should we not try to help them at all? Of course we should, though perhaps when something does get that out of hand then they should be required to work on themselves and fix their problem, I do think that is agreeable.	I am gonna be evil and ask why should we help people who bring cancer to themselves?	0

See: the randomtal's response below me. There's a silly stigma against pot, and a rally filled with a bunch of people that actually smoke it is just gonna get people more up in arms about it in a negative way. The fact is, there aren't enough people that think clearly in this country, and not because too many are drug-addled, but because too many are prejudiced without even getting to the stuff or the people that smoke, have bad morals that are against smoking a plant but for killing in God's name, or are just plain apathetic about change even without smoking.	"Yes, a rally filled with people who are smoking it is going to add to negative perceptions of the drug. On the other hand, if people could come together respectably, without the tie-dye and the weed, and protest the law, then we might have a shot. But the problem, as pointed out by Wishnia, is that this type of political rally doesn't draw a crowd the way a festival-centered one does. People come out more as ""pot-pride"" than to stand up for our rights.  It's unfair to blame those who are prejudiced against the drug for their prejudice. It clearly lies with the nation's propaganda attempts over the last century. People who have been convinced by lies and propaganda are not at fault for anything except their own ignorance of which they are unaware. If we're going to assign additional blame, it belongs with the media for not calling attention to the hypocrisy of alcohol/marijuana laws, especially in the face of countless studies (some funded by the federal government) which verify the facts.  The only other place to put blame, then, is on the people who have not been taken into the propaganda, who enjoy to smoke, but fail to do anything about it. Part of the problem here is that some stoners don't accept or admit to the facts. The fact is there are SOME harmful consequences from smoking weed. But the harmful consequences from maryjane are minimal compared to other legal drugs.  If stoners could admit the truth about the drug we love AND stand up to say it is wrong to make laws against our cognitive liberty in a way that is respectable, then we MIGHT have a shot."	0
This is a more intense detailed facts of the study conducted. Using a panel data set of over 3,000 counties from 1977 to 1996, Professors Hashem Dezhbakhsh, Paul R. Rubin, and Joanna M. Shepherd of Emory University found that each execution, on average, results in 18 fewer murders.[17] Using state-level panel data from 1960 to 2000, Professors Dezhbakhsh and Shepherd were able to compare the relationship between executions and murder incidents before, during, and after the U.S. Supreme Court's death penalty moratorium.[18] They found that executions had a highly significant negative relationship with murder incidents. Additionally, the implementation of state moratoria is associated with the increased incidence of murders. Separately, Professor Shepherd's analysis of monthly data from 1977 to 1999 found three important findings.[19] First, each execution, on average, is associated with three fewer murders. The deterred murders included both crimes of passion and murders by intimates. Second, executions deter the murder of whites and African-Americans. Each execution prevents the murder of one white person, 1.5 African-Americans, and 0.5 persons of other races. Third, shorter waits on death row are associated with increased deterrence. For each additional 2.75-year reduction in the death row wait until execution, one murder is deterred. Professors H. Naci Mocan and R. Kaj Gittings of the University of Colorado at Denver have published two studies confirming the deterrent effect of capital punishment. The first study used state-level data from 1977 to 1997 to analyze the influence of executions, commutations, and removals from death row on the incidence of murder.[20] For each additional execution, on average, about five murders were deterred. Alternatively, for each additional commutation, on average, five additional murders resulted. A removal from death row by either state courts or the U.S. Supreme Court is associated with an increase of one additional murder. Addressing criticism of their work,[21] Professors Mocan and Gittings conducted additional analyses and found that their original findings provided robust support for the deterrent effect of capital punishment.[22] Two studies by Paul R. Zimmerman, a Federal Communications Commission economist, also support the deterrent effect of capital punishment. Using state-level data from 1978 to 1997, Zimmerman found that each additional execution, on average, results in 14 fewer murders.[23] Zimmerman's second study, using similar data, found that executions conducted by electrocution are the most effective at providing deterrence.[24] Using a small state-level data set from 1995 to 1999, Professor Robert B. Ekelund of Auburn University and his colleagues analyzed the effect that executions have on single incidents of murder and multiple incidents of murder.[25] They found that executions reduced single murder rates, while there was no effect on multiple murder rates. In summary, the recent studies using panel data techniques have confirmed what we learned decades ago: Capital punishment does, in fact, save lives. Each additional execution appears to deter between three and 18 murders. While opponents of capital punishment allege that it is unfairly used against African-Americans, each additional execution deters the murder of 1.5 African-Americans. Further moratoria, commuted sentences, and death row removals appear to increase the incidence of murder. The strength of these findings has caused some legal scholars, originally opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds, to rethink their case. In particular, Professor Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago has commented: If the recent evidence of deterrence is shown to be correct, then opponents of capital punishment will face an uphill struggle on moral grounds. If each execution is saving lives, the harms of capital punishment would have to be very great to justify its abolition, far greater than most critics have heretofore alleged.[26]	If this is the case, you've made a convert of me. Capital punishments for everyone! Drinks all around!	0

I dislike all religions. I see no reason why disliking Christianity is fine, but disliking Judaism is forbidden. All religions. There are worse things than Judaism though :L And it's the religion not the people. I have a best friend who is Protestant, and her friend is Jewish and we get on fine. As long as we don't bring up religion.. And doesn't matter whether I am antisemitic or not, that's no excuse to say Jewish people are not people.  I'm not sure if you're trying to make me out as some Nazi demon or something, as antisemitism is normally associated with those types, but I'm no more against Judaism than any other religion. Maybe Scientology is worse..	I am glad you are anti everything, that is a better position to take.	0
So, if this mute girl squirms resists or runs away, you would conclude that she was not open to a sexual relationship? same as the dog. If, however she didn't resist, and seemed to enjoy it, being freely able to stop the attempt at sex at anytime, you would conclude she was good with it. this does not mean that every time a man wants to have sex with a mute girl he has to go through this process in front of a judge as you say. It would only take once, at most once per species, to establish that it is possible for an animal to be into a sexual relationship with a human.  The individual people who wanted to pursue such a relationship with an animal would be burdened with accessing the animal's receptiveness.  Now let me cut off your next argument. People would be just saying that the animal was into it and be performing animal abuse. This is an unfortunate fact about humanity, but is nothing new, people have raped other humans throughout history, this does not mean that we forbid consensual relationships between humans. why should an interspecies relationship be any different?	So, if this mute girl squirms resists or runs away, you would conclude that she was not open to a sexual relationship? same as the dog. I would not agree on letting the man have sex with the girl, since it could end up in rape. Of course, a human girl could make clear signs without using any form of language, that she is not into having sex. But the dog can easily be forced to have sex, which would result that the dog would end up being raped. And also if the owner molested the dog several times and hit him and stuff like that, the dog would probably be quiet in fear of being hit. Understand me? And seriously.. you can't ask for anybody to have sex in front of you to prove love. That is ridiculous.	0
"I disagree. And a book you may be interested in is Female Chauvinist Pigs, about women who perpetuate this sort of stereotyping.  Perhaps I give women too much credit, but I don't think so. I think the women in the industry are smart enough to know that they are a marketable commodity and smart enough to use that. It does not say ""I am a plaything but not a woman,"" but rather, ""I am selling images of myself because they will bring you pleasure and bring me lots of money"". So, in essence, they're preying off men's undying lust. I guess it really comes down to, who do you blame? The demander or the supplier?"	"EXACTLY as you say -- women aren't PEOPLE, they're ""marketable commodities."" And commodities, as we all know, are things, not people. Commodities exist to be acquired and owned; they have no autonomy, no independence, no individuality. That is EXACTLY the problem with media stereotyping of women."	0
Cultures change. Therefore ethics change. Therefore ethics are either subjective, constructed, or illusory. Well of course, but is this to say ethics of the present are not relevant? They are very relevant. And a general population agreeing upon them is no work of the supernatural. Culture changes based around what is needed to advance said culture. Therefore applying a subjective, constructed, or illusory system to an objective race leads to no conclusions whatsoever. And why is that? Just because they are a general product of the imagination does not mean they are not relevant. We think up these things for a reason, and the end reason is to advance ourselves. If they had no purpose or reason behind being thought up and accepted as relevant, then they would not have been thought up and accepted as relevant. Therefore, eugenics is ethically uncertain No, they're not. Most would agree that forcing sterility upon someone is unethical, and such agreement is not irrelevant when taking a look at this. Perhaps if it was voluntary sterilization, it would not be unethical, but sterility is no laughing matter. Breeding is programed into our genes and our brains. If someone says they're okay with being sterilized, you have to ask why they're okay with it. And more likely then not, the reason they're okay with it will be deeply embedded in what would be considered extremely unethical or illogical rationale.

Outrage is not the same as rage. Grab a dictionary. Outrage is extreme anger, so is rage. They are closely related at least, synonyms at best. Either way, my point stands that you are projecting a feeling onto to me which I have neither expressed nor demonstrated.  Rapists are sex offenders so they are put on a list, due to them not being trusted. No such list for atheists. You are absolutely missing the point on the research about atheists, if not actively trying to distort it. I have clearly explained it twice now. I have linked to the resource substantiating it and further explaining it. If you do not get it from all of that then there is very little I can do and even less point in trying to debate with you. I have never seen religion come up in my professional affairs and very few of my personal ones. Hence I have not been discriminated against. Good for you. I have. Knowing that most Americans/Christians distrust atheists more than any other group is an obvious basis for concluding that being openly non-theist will more likely than not lead to discrimination. That you have gotten lucky or not been as open about your views hardly contradicts research or my personal experience, the former being something you have not refuted and the latter being something you cannot. Shall I ask your religion before I greet you? I just don't want to offend. Yes, you should. For the express reasons that I have already detailed and which you have not directly countered. Or just don't wish me a Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday... wish me a plane old good day. The simplest form of goodwill wishing.	"I'm not missing the point about the article. It surveyed 350 people from a country of 316 million with no reference to how they randomized their selection. While that may not negate it's results, the questions posed were hypothetical. People may not want to hire an atheist for a high-trust job, but in reality they won't ask the question. Religious questions aren't asked unless it actually relates to the job. Personal affairs are different. being openly non-theist will more likely than not lead to discrimination What does openly non-theist mean? Do you announce it to people?  I think it's hilarious that you think that asking ones faith before a greeting is somehow less offensive!  It's not about YOU. It's about them. When someone says hello, they are the ones being nice. They aren't saying you should be. It is ridiculous to expect a greeting to be tailor made for every receiver. It doesn't matter if the greeting has religious or cultural meaning, it's not about YOU.  You are right that there is no real point in debating so feel free to have the last word. I would like to be a good sport and wish you a ""Happy Godless Gay day"", but since we are already off on the wrong foot, Merry Christmas. Oh and Happy New Year too!"	0

Look at the words carefully. It doesn't say, for Atheism, that they don't believe in any other super human body, it says they don't believe in God.(IE: Christianity's deity.) You can be an Atheist and still believe in the Olympic gods, for example.	I don't think that's correct. I think the term god is just a blanket name for higher powered being in general.

Firstly abortion has to do with an unborn life, innocent of all crimes, mistakes or guilt. The fetus as we all know is referred to as a growing human being which can also be referred to as a human organism. The term organism refers to life so the terms combined would mean human life. The Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.  Most abortions occur before the embryo becomes a foetus, about 50%. Around 35% occur before it's a well-developed foetus. This means you're killing unconscious, unintelligent tissues. It isn't a human life at this point. A well-developed foetus isn't a human life either, because its body depends on another host being, its body is not complete in other words. What puzzles me is many who oppose the death penalty supports abortion when they claim that they are so concerned about human life. If they are so concerned about human life then why would they support the taking of the life of the unborn? This in my opinion is hypocrisy. Practice what you speak not the opposite.  This is simple actually. Killing a prisoner is removing a living, breathing, thinking human from existence. Killing a foetus is removing something that only resembles a human, but is not for lack of ability to think, from existence. Why fight for the life of a criminal who has and may continue to kill and never regret it when at the same time you are supporting for innocent young lives to be killed in horrific methods of abortion when you claim the death penalty is horrific itself. Because they are not innocent young lives. They are in the process of becoming lives.	"Whether or not abortions occur before the embryo becomes a fetus you fail to understand that these tissues are the tissues of a growing human being. Contrary to what many non-scientists believe, human beings are not constructed in the womb - they develop. In fact, all the major organ systems are initiated within the first few weeks after conception. The process of embryonic development is a continuous process, with no obvious point at which the fetus magically becomes a ""person."" In fact, the development process continues well after birth, including many characteristics that determine our personality or personhood. What are the stages in human embryonic development? Science tells us that the heart of the human fetus begins to form 18 days after conception. There is a measurable heart beat 21-24 days after conception. This is only 7-10 days after a women would expect to begin her menses. Since most women have cycles that can vary by this amount, they do not discover they are pregnant until after this point. Therefore, all abortions stop a beating heart, even ""early"" abortions. However, most abortions do not occur until 4-6 weeks after the fetus begins to form. The human brain begins to form on day 23 is formed enough to produce brain waves by 6 weeks, which means that most abortions destroy a functioning human brain. The U.S Supreme Court has ruled in favor of this argu"	0

OK, all kidding aside, if we make a blanket statement that they do not chose to be homosexuals then the slippery slope I fear is that some nut is going to claim that he can cure homosexuality through genetic engineering.

Beyond that, I would answer no. Killing a person doesn't alleviate any of the suffering or damage they caused in the past. What about potential for suffering and damage in the future? I know that prosecuting based on future crimes is silly, but at the point someone is already facing life in the system for absolutely horrendous, inhuman crimes, why not? I would just hate to end up in prison for tax fraud or something and end up with a mass-murdering child rapist for a cellmate. And I would hate to be a prison guard having to handle someone who is beyond redemption, shows no remorse for their crimes, and has nothing to lose because they are already facing life imprisonment. If we dont have that one final say in the matter, the death penalty, what's to stop a killer from killing after he's been convicted and sentenced to the fullest extent of the law? We could put them in solitary confinement for life, never let anyone close enough to get hurt, but that seems to me to be more a cruel and unusual punishment than death.  And I think for the families of the victims, knowing that some kind of substantial justice was dealt does bring peace of mind. At least, it's better than dragging the grieving families back to court every year to listen to the criminal appeal to the judge on why he should be let out early for good behavior.	What about potential for suffering and damage in the future? I know that prosecuting based on future crimes is silly, but at the point someone is already facing life in the system for absolutely horrendous, inhuman crimes, why not? If someone is this dangerous, then they should be in a situation where they don't have the opportunity to hurt anyone. Once they're in that situation, then I don't see the point of killing them except to solve the problems of cost and space, which aren't invalid, but are secondary to the principle of not allowing anyone to choose what deserves death as a punishment and what doesn't.  We could put them in solitary confinement for life, never let anyone close enough to get hurt, but that seems to me to be more a cruel and unusual punishment than death. If a criminal were to be in this situation and decide they would rather be dead, that should be an option.  And I think for the families of the victims, knowing that some kind of substantial justice was dealt does bring peace of mind. At least, it's better than dragging the grieving families back to court every year to listen to the criminal appeal to the judge on why he should be let out early for good behavior. As much as I can't even imagine how difficult it is to lose a loved on like this, I think it's dangerous to base a justice system on retribution instead of prevention. There are lots of terrible things we could do to criminals that would make their victims feel better.	0
For as long as I have been Christian, prayer has done something to me.

The majority of the world is not Christian and does not celebrate Christmas. <a href='http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/'>Source is Pew Forum Christmas is also not just a word.

As a queer person and an atheist, I have personally faced legal and social discrimination and hatred my entire life because of religion for no other reason than that I exist. Wishing me a Merry Christmas is, at best, trying to wish me well through the very institutionalized religion that has oppressed me my entire life. It would be like a man wishing women a happy man day or a white person wishing racial minorities a happy white day.	And by the way, I just looked at your link and each of the world's regions is majority Christian, besides Asia Pacific and Middle East/North Africa. I'm also pretty sure that you live in either Europe or North America. Europe is 90% Christian and North America is over 77% Christian... so by those stats, I'm pretty sure that you're going to come across mostly Christians.	0
Killing innocent creations like we do, isn't survival. If it was we would ALL be doing the same thing.  Ever heard of a lion who never killed a deer and ate it? Such a lion doesn't exist. Every heard of a human who never ate an animal? Yes, there are millions.	Ever heard of a lion who never killed a deer and ate it? Lions kill deer because they have to to survive.

So you would never take your parent to the doctor if they were old and couldn't walk? You would never take them out for a meal if hey were lonely?  I would hate to have you as a child.	I never said anything like that. Did you miss the many times where I said that if a child has good parents, they might choose to take care of them. Not out of obligation, but because they want to? I never mentioned my personal feelings about my own parents. That's irrelevant to this debate. You shouldn't have children. Because they might be like me (whatever that means to you, seeing as how you don't know me at all), and as you said, you would hate that. Children aren't obedient slaves to love and take care of you unconditionally.	0
There are four types of ghosts, and each has its own spectrum and these overlap. The weakest can be dangerous to humans. This is the partially dispersed. The partially dispersed, or PD best fits the description 'half dead'. The PD ghost is used by death mages as a conduit for gathering information. A PD is barely lucid and can infuse itself with an area, bringing back elements of that area's past as short lived apparitions. This is the most common. The malignant also has very weak lucidity, and they are trapped in a cycle of despair in which they can use human puppets to act out their last moments. These are not to be confused with the poltergeist, which are fully lucid and just kill people because they are bored. To conclude, we have the quiet, which just hangs around and does nothing.

Any place (physical or virtual) that is exclusive to sex, race, religion, or otherwise, is actually discriminating. If you have a private golf club that is men only, is that not discriminating against women? So, why then is the website in question not categorized the same way? It is designed for the ""exclusive use"" of a certain group of people to the ""exclusion"" of others. That has nothing to do about being able to build a web site exclusive to a different group. It is about discriminating against ""race"" in this case, thus my comment about it being racist."	0
Either you're being very naive or have no understanding of black markets. They made marijuana very illegal, said it caused death, insanity, murder, rape and societal collapse... And guess what? People still smoked it, despite it being non-addictive. Cigarettes are addictive, everyone who is still addicted would buy them and young people would still keep picking them up. A market isn't created by the government saying that something is legal, it is create when someone has a supply of something that people demand. You make cigarettes illegal (or tobacco in general) people will still want it and the black market would quickly respond. As for people choosing marijuana instead, marijuana is very easy to get. Actually, most people are introduced to tobacco and marijuana at the same time, late in high school or early in college.	I don't know the stats, but I think less people smoke cigarettes than there are people who smoke weed. If both are illegal, I think the people who are in the less category will transfer over.	0

"""Vampires, are known for their superhuman agility, speed, balance, and tracking people or things according to their scent They also have the ability to hypnotize their victims with their mesmerizing eyes, which will at times flash in a golden or silver tone, depending on their mood. They can fly for a limited period, as long as it is night in their human form. If they are in their bat form, they can fly relatively longer in exchange for their increased vulnerability to sunlight. Speaking of transforming into bats, they can transform into any creature they wise, but it has to be real. (No imaginary stuff, well, maybe a dragon.) Since they are the living-dead, they can survive without having to eat food or water, although they can eat to blend into society. They can stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, because they don't need to breathe. More powerful vampires can control the weather, so vampire hunters usually target areas where there has been much unusual cloudy or foggy days/nights. They can be inflicted with a small/large amount of damage, but they need human blood to replenish themselves if the damage is large. If it is like a small cut, it can be healed fast by itself. Vampires can live on animal blood instead of human. They also don't age until after a few centuries. This can be prevented by drinking a baby's blood, which is known for their regenerative properties.

How it that outrageous? How isn't it? A bottled water from a store is about $1.39. $3.75-$1.39=$2.36 extra going into the pockets of private owners. the government could set ordinances or laws setting a price floor. Oh, but that's a regulation. People like you can't stand regulations until it helps you out. What about those people who are forced into paying more taxes in order to fund government parks who otherwise never go to the parks? That's not my problem. The parks are there for them if they choose to use it. If a city spends $100,000 on upkeep of a park per year for a city of 50,000 people, then that's only $2 per person per year, where as a private park would be probably about $2 per person per visit. If a parent takes their child to the park every week, then it would be about $208 per year. Theme parks are private, but leisure parks must be public. Where is the logic?  Nowhere does it say that leisure parks must be public.	A bottled water from a store is about $1.39. $3.75-$1.39=$2.36 extra going into the pockets of private owners. Don't buy bottled water. Oh, but that's a regulation. People like you can't stand regulations until it helps you out. That is offensive because I never said that government should be totally absent. $100,000 park for 50,000 people. What land is that? Imaginary. A nearby suburb city has a 900,000 budget for 17,000 people at $52 per person per year, but some people pay less than others due to property taxes. So, some have to pay for others to visit the park at a discount rate. How is that fair? So, if that same parent goes once a week, that is one dollar. However, based on the socialized math, why should that parent get cheaper leisure just because they have more time than I do. Ex. She goes 100 times in a one year, that is only .50 per visit, but if I go only once, that is a expensive park visit of $52.  If private companies were to compete for that those parks, they could easily provide a service at a lower cost. If one dollar for daily fee, then once a week, then $100 a year is a fair price. Nowhere does it say that leisure parks must be public. Name a leisure park that is not public.	0

With all of the unemployment in America, it's statements like these that are really dumb. Right, moving right along. With the Democrats proposed system, the more you employ, the less you get to keep ...because more people are doing your job. the more you have to make the workers you hire work, More employees = more individual workload? I'm willing to completely disagree with you on that one. The more people you have working for you, the more you can get done with less individual workload, i.e. the whole premise of employment.  or hire less. Hire less if your business can't afford it? Well then maybe the problem is the shitty business. There is no incentive to starting a business Profit. which I assure you is not an easy task Agreed. - The thing is that an owner expects a personal salary parabolic to their workers, and succeeds in doing so by paying them less. If profit weren't the main incentive, but rather maximal benefit, then the wages between the worker and the owner would be much closer, and the excess profit would go back into improving the business. I've worked for small businesses before, and yes they are a lot of work, but not just for the owner. For every employee. In fact the few small business owners I've worked for really just managed the hiring and payroll.	..because more people are doing your job. No, because the government forces you to pay more for benefits. It should be linear. If I have one employee and he can make 2 products a day. Having 2 employees would mean 4 a day. If the business owner has to pay for a bunch of benefits if he hires a third person, what is the point, he can only get 6 products out of it. More employees = more individual workload? I'm willing to completely disagree with you on that one. The more people you have working for you, the more you can get done with less individual workload, i.e. the whole premise of employment.  If he hires the third person and benefits have to be paid to everyone, he would need 3 products from each person. Now, the workers have to work harder in order to sustain their new benefits. Hire less if your business can't afford it? Well then maybe the problem is the shitty business. The business is perfectly fine, but now more money goes from the owner to the workers, why would someone want to be an owner at that point? Profit Which you will gladly take from the owner and give to the workers.	0

"""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.""  Albert Einstein Evidence to support my original comment. I present proof and those that oppose this position provide none."	Personal anecdotes and a quote from a notable figure are not proof. You have stated your case and stated it fairly clearly. However, the fact remains it is nothing but a personal philosophy. My philosophy is that people who choose not to involve themselves in a potentially dangerous situation do not deserve legal consequences. In fact, unless I am mistaken, police officers do not want bystanders to intervene in crimes in progress. Average citizens are probably not aware of the necessary safety precautions and legal procedures, and could possibly get themselves injured or complicate the situation.  Reporting a crime is a different matter. If someone is in a position of safety where calling the police could not conceivably draw negative attention to them, I do not see any reason why they should not do so. But this is only part of the debate and it would be almost impossible to enforce this as a law.	0

And interesting note is that God is one for monogamy (and no re-marriage after divorce). And Aids wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem if everyone stuck with one sexual partner for life.

Though this question is much too broad and has no context, I believe physician-assisted suicide, a type of human euthanasia, should be legalized.	Even if the question is too broad and has no context, I think that legalization of euthanasia is negation of moral and ethical principles on which humanity is based and the terms physician-assisted suicide and murder are synonyms. Legalized euthanasia can be abused by government, doctors and even relatives. It will become a cost-effective replacement of palliative care and medical research for terminal diseases will also decrease. In addition people who are not going to support their ill relatives and consider them as a burden might choose euthanasia rather than palliative care.	0

The only just cause can be resistance of aggression. Aggression is here the 'use of armed force in violation of someone else's basic rights'. Moral agents bear moral responsibility. Moral agents are capable of reflection, forming intentions and behaving accordingly. The opposite is being determined.

If you wait for someone to attack you and then defend, there are more negatives for you because: a - you don't know where or how they're going to attack, which makes it hard. b - you're on home soil where your citizens are going to suffer the consequences of war. .

Unpopular laws are characteristic of an overreaching government. Citizens should have a reasonable say in the law. Yes I agree, but who chooses what is reasonable and what is not? The Government. If it brings more harm to the system then it is deemed unreasonable. So you're in favor of killing people because it's better for national stability? Not the point. No one would have to be killed if they just didn't have another child. And no one is stopping them from having another child. If they really want to have another child simply move to somewhere where this law does not exist.	Yes I agree, but who chooses what is reasonable and what is not? The Government. No, the citizens do.  If it brings more harm to the system then it is deemed unreasonable. Right. And I think it can be argued that the policy has brought way more harm than good to the system, therefore it is unreasonable. Not the point. No one would have to be killed if they just didn't have another child. So you're arguing there's enough inherently wrong about having a child to warrant death? I find that ridiculous. And no one is stopping them from having another child. If they really want to have another child simply move to somewhere where this law does not exist. This should not be the case. One should not have to leave their country simply because they want a family.	0

The question asked best. I think it'd be best overall if cigarettes were illegal. If the government made them illegal to sell, the market for it might completely die, what with the other stuff you could smoke out there. Cigarettes can cause cancer, and other health issues, marijuana won't. So if it's illegal to smoke either which do you think more people will pick up?	Either you're being very naive or have no understanding of black markets. They made marijuana very illegal, said it caused death, insanity, murder, rape and societal collapse... And guess what? People still smoked it, despite it being non-addictive. Cigarettes are addictive, everyone who is still addicted would buy them and young people would still keep picking them up.

Thats the last thing we need is for kids to be encouraged to have sex and are able to get condoms from their own school, thats just saying ""hey if you want to have sex, go for it, we'll even give you protection"". I agree thats its your own personal choice to choose when you want to have sex but I don't think that condoms should be sold in schools, its just sending the wrong message to kids.  School IS for learning, not buying sex products"	the school would be selling them for a quarter each and it wouldnt be encouraging the students to have sex. in the survey that i previously talked about, most of the girls said that they thought that 11-15 years old is the right time to have sex so they would be needing the protection.	0
Nicole's right, plus it kind of already is, unless we choose for it not to be. Like, my name is my name, and yours Jake, plus we have our pick, and I have links and everything else.

Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	you dare question the pope's authority?	0
You are being stupendously arrogant. The nature of the existence of time has been, and still is debated within philosophical and scientific circles. This is a question with no right or wrong answer, an answer that would require knowledge of the one true epistemological position. Unless you have that (in which case what are you doing on here, go get your Nobel Prize), your answer is no more valid than anyone else's, thus your tone is too officious for one who doesn't actually know the answer.	Nobel Prize? Which one? Literature?.... Existence of time? Yes time exists, it's used in most of mechanics equations if it would be just just a random value equations wouldn't work. Time is a property same as gravity, length...etc. Just because you cannot pour it into a cup it does not mean that it doesn't exist.	0

I do think that women have it harder than men here. I don't think that just because men face similar circumstances that everything is fair. If I thought that I would have made a very different post. But I don't think its because the portrayal of men isn't as extreme or because we face less of it. I think its all in the eye of the beholder so to speak.  Since men do have significantly more successful role models that aren't 50% silicone and botox, when men and women alike see a pitiful al bundy or perfect james bond it is much easier to realize that it is not reality. Women don't have the luxury so it is harder to distinguish between what is being embellished and what is based on reality. I don't think role models are the only reason that these ads are perceived negatively. I think the most important reason has more to do with tradition. Even without TV and magazines, children grow up with the expectation that boys will get good jobs and find attractive wives while girls will try to impress the boy with the best job so they can make his dinner and watch his babbys.  With those expectations already in our head, we open a magazine and turn on the TV. The boys are looking for ways to become successful and ways to recognize attractive girls. The girls are looking for ways to attract boys and ways to raise children. The damage has already been done. The problem isn't that they found what they were looking for; the problem is that they were looking for it. If the topic here was the morality of advertising itself then I would not once defend it. I am very much against people trying to influence me into buying things. The question here though is whether or not magazines victimize women and I am under the assumption that we are mainly referring to ads. I really don't think that it is the ad or magazine itself that makes women victims. I definitely don't think that censoring these ads will end sexism. Having sex is something that drives humans without rationality; this will probably always be the case. Even if gender roles were abolished, ads that depicted a women as nothing more than an object to have sex with would still be effective and would still be used. These ads wouldn't be offensive however because being well educated we would recognize them as an advertisements and embellishments. We would not be looking for a definition of 'woman' and we would not be influenced be viewing them.  If these types of ads exist in both sexist and non sexist societies and also do not exist in some societies with very evident sexism, how can anyone conclude that the are one of the causes of sexism or victimization or however you want to put it?	Yes, ads are not the only problem, but that is also not the argument here. Every form of media that constantly and strictly relegates women to a submissive, inferior role is the problem. Advertising is one of those forms of media. It further reinforces these stereotypes, and inundates daily life with them. Just because the harmful effects of ads are already in place doesn't mean there is no point in trying to make people see them for what they are. That is the only way to really change things. I am not advocating censorship by any means, because that would be simply covering up a symptom of a disease. I believe that if women were truly equal we would see a dramatic drop in these ads, or perhaps a disappearance altogether. I'm not arguing its effectiveness, but I believe if people all saw how insidiously wrong and disturbing many of these ads are, they would find another way to go about things. Racist caricatures and a far more obvious brand of sexism were once common and accepted in media, but as the general mindset made a shift, they disappeared and most people today would find these old portrayals appalling.  Which non-sexist society are you referring to? Parts of the world where you do not see these advertisements are often plagued by a different incarnation of sexism. In many parts of the Middle East, women are invisible. They are hidden rather than broadly exhibited because they are the private possession of their husband, for his eyes only, something he can do whatever he wants with. In America, a woman's body and personal life is constantly on display for public consumption. The anti-abortion effort, the countless weight-loss pills, various forms of hair removal, anti-aging solutions, and plastic surgery are just a few of the ways that women are made to feel bad about the way they look, or people in a position of power are trying to remove control from them. <a href='http://www.cosmopolitan.com/'>http://www.cosmopolitan.com/ That's just the front page for the magazine Cosmo.

Limiting would help prevent obesity. When KFC e.c.t was introduced in china the obesity level began to rise. These restaurants encourage the eating of junk food, which causes obesity.	"They don't encourage eating junk food, they encourage grabbing a quick bite to eat if you're on the road or running low on money, its not their fault that some people go and eat there everyday. The worst thing for you is not fast food, its candy and soda, you want to try and ""limit"" (eventually ban) those as well?"	0
Menial jobs like you stated would be more of a community thing, but as far as store clerks or any other job those can be automated but lets remember there is no money so clerks would just be pretty much inventory and that can be automated, jobs like teachers and such would be left to those that truly love to teach making learning that much better for our children, also lets not forget a good 50% of all jobs as we know today would be gone because those jobs are based on a monetary system, the only thing that would be left are intellectual jobs, like teaching, medicine and such. A good 90% of all our need can be automated by machines in some way even our lawns, having no money would leave us humans to unlock our fullest potential to advance humanity, think of it like this, what is your hobby?.... some people fix cars in there garage others think of inventions, those things are what people love to do without pay, hell they spend money on those things, picture a world where every human can pursue there passion and master what they love, think of the human advancement, we would unlock warp drive/time travel and be traveling the stars, but only if money was no object, money is hold back humanity. Without money our frame of mind would change, people would start to be kind with each other, its our nature to support one another, money among other things is what keeps us apart, things that can't be done by machines can be done by volunteers or a community chore list (think jury duty) of some sort, I dream of a day that we all on earth become what we are truly meant to be, bother and sister together living in our home and our only goal is to try to make home and ourselves better and work on making the human species immortal, one big earth like family with all of us in mind, only then will we be able to unlock what we where mean to be and maybe get to understand our true meaning and why where even exist.	Menial jobs like you stated would be more of a community thing Do you really see people being fine with volunteering? I can imagine there being a few willing, but I really doubt that in a world like this that people would be okay with this, people are too greedy, not only with material, but also non-material. what is your hobby?.... some people fix cars in there garage others think of inventions, those things are what people love to do without pay The amount of people that have hobbies that also benefit the society are rather low. In a world like this I see people getting lazy. How would you stop this? we would unlock warp drive/time travel and be traveling the stars Even in this type of world these types of things would still be hundreds if not thousands of years away. Assuming that those things are humanly possible though.. The idea is all dandy, but I don't see any basis behind it that shows that it would work. I personally don't see it ever happening. Although if you think It would work and should be done, keep speaking out about it and do what to can to make it happen. I going to stay on the side being my passive self. Good luck. If a world so 'perfect' can exist, it would be nice to see it.	0

Ah, but what about someone whose dad makes $2000 a month? Do you believe that only, er 1/10 kids maybe, deserve an education? And how much do you think it would cost you personally to employ several teachers with different expertise for 40 some hours per week?  How much lower would your taxes be if you are still paying for all of the roads, military, infrastructure, etc?  Do you think the say, extra 300 a month you save by not putting any taxes toward school, pay for an education equal to what you are receiving? The fact is that, all through history in every single case, when we share the cost to educate all kids, everyone pays less then they would otherwise (even your dad), and everyone gets a better education.  If you don't believe it look at the U.S. We used to be #1 in everything, everything.  Every year we want to invest less and less because so many think like you, and every year we fall further and further behind.  You're lucky. Take advantage of what you have.	I know what you say is true - but I'm a libertarian, I want to be the boss of my own money. People who make 2000$ a month can barely survive - sure they have free healthcare and school, but what about food? Food is expensive, and especially where I live. And even if they had enough money to buy food and stuff, why am I supposed to pay for their school system, what if I don't even want to go to school myself? And the free healthcare and education is not as good as you think - because it is free, there is no competition, and competition is good - when you compete, you try to be better than everyone else, there is no need for that here, because everything is sponsored by the country. Also hospitals and the education isn't the best you can get when it's free - because the hospitals and the schools are not on a very high budget, therefore they can't hire the best doctors or the best teachers. I'd rather pay my hospital bill, and get real healthcare, than get free crappy healthcare, and I'd rather pay for my education, and get a real one, than get a crappy one for free. More and more people who have the money to do it, choose a private school, because they are much much much better - and MOST of the people can't afford schools like that, because 60-70% of their salary goes to taxes. Yes, I feel bad for those who can't afford to provide school for their children. But if I want to donate my money to those kids, I want to do it voluntarily.	0
All of the above support more access to better education for poor people, who happen to be concentrated in urban areas. The idea they do not want people educated is lunatic right-wing retardedness.	Pardon me if I'm suffering from lunatic right-wing retardedness, but these supposed leaders actually do NOT spend most of their time trying to support education in the lower class urban areas. Instead, they play to their lowest base instincts of racism and envy and encourage them to blame others for their lack of fortune of success rather than harbor an attitude of anything is possible if you work hard, learn, and achieve. It's why we see so many welfare families having children they can't afford as a way to increase their government checks, and then turn the kids out to the streets where many join gangs to find some semblance of family and acceptance. And it goes on from generation to generation, and is embraced by the democratic party, IMO.	0

Really? The full spectrum of light would pass through, you just wouldn't be able to see the sun, moon, etc.	"Before their would have been no day or night due to the cloudy (that's an extreme understatement) atmosphere. I was responding to this point specifically in my last response. If the light can be seen through the cloud, then there would be day and night.   1:15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth "";and it was so.  If they were already there and there was already light, then why say this? What I said originally is that, if you read genesis like you are saying, then it doesn't matter what order the bible puts them in. You could just make it all fit the observed facts. Why should you treat day 4 differently to any of the other days? If it was supposed to mean the cloudy atmosphere clearing, it wouldn't of said he made the sun and the moon and the stars on the fourth day as it does."	0
NO, hes to young and has no experience. he has a bad economic plan plus he does not support offshore drilling.	Offshore drilling is a short term solution to a long term problem. America only has 3% of the world's oil supply but we consume 25%. How can furthering our dependence on oil solve that? Not to mention the environmental impact of petroleum based fuels. He is instead investing in alternative energy which is a much smarter idea. Relying on oil to solve our energy crisis is about as stupid as investing in pagers 10 years ago. I'm not sure why specifically you think his economic plan is bad. Please elaborate. As for the experience thing, you can see simply from his advisor picks that he knows what he is doing. He's not picking yes men, but people who are experts in their field. I am very hopeful that Obama will correct a lot of the mistakes that have been made over the last couple years.	0
Two years ago I finally give in to modern technology, bought a computer, and began searching the web, only to end up in disappointment.

Dating sites only want your money. Anything that is free on here isn't worth the price. Misinformation and a world that is only filled with small minds.

There is nothing that you can pay for, that cannot be found for free on the internet.	0
We're talking about physics and suddenly there's a raving lunatic in the room talking about something completely different. Now, I've seen both Christians and atheists doing this and it seems very much to be an American thing. So your assertion is that only Americans are ever raving lunatics when it comes to religious issues? Do you consider the men who flew the planes into the twin towers to be raving lunatics, in addition to being homicidal maniacs? I do. I think most people do. So how can you even imply that religious insanity is a strictly American phenomena? Indeed, if you think about it, most of the religious insanity and most of the insanely religious people that has/have existed throughout history (we're talking upwards of 98%) existed before the USA even existed as a country, so I don't know how you can say things like religious and atheist insanity and nonsense is very much an American thing and expect anything but laughter.  I don't mean to be rude, but I really think you ought to have thought this one out more before you went and made a debate on the subject, especially since your position relies on the kind of shameless, baseless stereotyping and generalizing we see in racism. It comes across as very crude.	"Do you consider the men who flew the planes into the twin towers to be raving lunatics, in addition to being homicidal maniacs? Sure I do. But there were only 12 of them. most of the religious insanity and most of the insanely religious people that has/have existed throughout history (we're talking upwards of 98%) existed before the USA even existed as a country I think that's an interesting point. This isn't exactly a counter-argument but a rhetorical question: It it religious fanaticism when it's the norm? So some extent, I wonder if the ""fanatics"" of history were in fact not so odd at all and that their religious fervor might've been considered reasonable normal for their time. That's just a though I'm having after your comment. I've got no idea what the answer is."	0
A criminal is a product of his environment, they take risks which may take years of their life or most of their property away from them for a reason. Its non-nonsensical to suggest that most criminals choose to go to jail, pay heavy fines, receive the bad name of criminal, etc  If you want to change a criminal, you give him the tools to change his environment.	Most criminals don't have property that is valued, because it is stolen. One cannot value something that was obtained in minutes, not years.  Criminals think it is a privilege to be jailed, it makes them fit in. They are now part of something. Ohio has the orange plate club. One obtains an orange license plate for DUI and the plates line the parking lots of bars. They proudly display what is supposed to be punishment. The only way to stop a crook is with their last breath.	0

"I think the idea is there are less black people. It's like 17% of the population or something. In reality most dating sites are ""whitepeoplemeet.com"" they just don't have to call it that because there are more. Probably if one happens to want to meet a black person regular dating sites are too filled with non-black people to make searching efficient. It's not like their spewing ""I hate whitey"" on the site. Just sounds like one of thos right wing self-victimization things where they start crying how bad they have it. Kinda pathetic."	"That's all completely true. But equality is equality. Equality doesn't care about numbers..  Equality can sometimes seem brutal. If you think about it..  For example if I was the head of a company and I was going to hire 10 people and the 10 best most qualified people for the job were asian women then I would hire 10 asian women. Why shouldn't I? If I thought they were the most skilled and qualified? With total equality I wouldn't have anything to prove. I wouldn't be required to show diversity.  It's not a pro asian women thing(or an anti everybody els thing), it's a pro skill and qualification thing.  Let's look at a question asked by the debate creator: ""wouldn't the the black community throw a goddam fit having the NAACP and Al Sharpton all over the news trying to ban the site.""  -That's a little extreme isn't it. But people on the other side would be angry there's no denying that. I don't know if they would say ""you can't do that"" (we're not necessarily talking about rights or laws) but they would be angry or annoyed at the very least. So with total equality is there any validity in their aggravation?  This poses three interesting questions; Do we really want equality? Do we really have equality? And is the idea of total equality even realistic?  1. I do. But sad to say a lot of people black and white want the opposite.  2.&3;. Hard to say. We've come a long way but it's difficult to achieve because of human nature. Given that I think we're doing a decent job. But we don't have nor will we ever have pure total equality because of people getting fussy over pro white things and vice verse.  (These are honest questions I actually had to think about)  I do agree that for efficiency there would be need for a website like this.  And I don't think the website is racist by the way. EDIT: Ok so I probably shouldn't have actually ""disputed"" your argument because I really didn't dispute anything you said. I kind of got on a tangent about equality. Heck this could have been it's own debate. (;"	0

As a queer person and an atheist, I have personally faced legal and social discrimination and hatred my entire life because of religion for no other reason than that I exist.

This is obvious propaganda, and those quotes are out of context. The Tony Stark quotes are all from before his change of heart in the movie, lets face it Stark is much more electable than batman. Batman the strong silent type could never be elected president because he does not have public speaking skills. where as Mr stark can stand behind a podium and with just his quick wit have everyone eating out of his hands While i am not one to call batman stupid, but against Stark, who created a reactor the size of a small plate in a cave in the desert, his accomplishments are trivial. With Starks intellect there would be no civil matter he couldn't handle. Balance the budget? NO problem. want a end to national deficit? Vote Ironman If you really want to turn the economy around, if you really want to put an end to war and the defense budget VOTE IRONMAN A ARMY OF ONE!	Yes, because the ability to build a reactor the size of a small plate will contribute to non-proliferation. Give me a break! Stark is an megalomaniacal, egotistical, sophist.

Well I suppose if the man is involved, and it was perfectly mutual then he should have some say, but ultimately it has to be her choice. If she does not want to carry the child because of some insecurities and she feels she is not ready for a child, he has to accept her decision. And especially with deciding for abortion. If she wants to keep the child he has to accept that decision even if he was just trying to get rid of it just to save his wallet.	Yes but he should have much more of a say.

I did explain to you how God did something but of course you didn't read what I said when I was trying to find out how God exists He answered my prayer through His Word in the Bible which I found so God did answer my prayer as well as others on a daily basis.	"You asked god (correct me if im wrong) to prove to you he existed correct? And then you read the bible. The bible is what ""proved"" to you he existed. So god didnt really do anything, you yourself did by reading the bible yourself. See what i mean? You sought out the answer to the prayer, god didnt really answer it.  A real answer and real PROOF of his existence would be if you had not done anything at all. Not read the bible or did internet research, nothing. If you just went about your daily life normally then BOOM god starts talking to you or you see him or something tangible that you didnt do yourself. See the difference?  Also, reading the bible does not prove god is real. Of course if you read the Koran it will say their god is real. Of course if you read a Wiccan spellbook it will say their god and goddess are real. Its just words on paper. It's meaningless and certainly not proof enough to believe that god exists and everything written about him in the rest of the bible is true."	0
"Yeah, this is a really dumb debate.  I mean, people we know are going to die whether we're alive at the time or not. Like, me dying won't magically make someone else not die. So if given the choice, why the hell wouldn't you want to live? Please, ""seeing the ones we love die, wah!"" lame. I wonder if anyone else sees how incredibly self-centered this debate really is? Think about it. The idea is, the people who would like to die now want to do so in order to avoid facing the death of others. Meanwhile, we know the death of others is inevitable. Everyone dies. So what's the point whether you're around to see it or not? Are you so important, or such a martyr, that you're too special to have to go through that pain? What's so great about you, that you shouldn't have to go through what everyone else does? Of course given the choice, almost everyone will choose to live forever, I suspect even those who say they would not. Get over yourselves, and you'll get over people you know are going to die as well."	Iamdavidh,  Been here for a year and call others lame. Lame is clearly the words of a loser. Your opinion is just that and nobody really cares about it. To know it most be such a burden. An atheist that plays God.	0
"Oh right someone who goes on and on with rubbish about belief and truth believes nothing. Your transparency is a given.  here's one <a href='http://youtu.be/r7vezOwTVnQ'>http://youtu.be/r7vezOwTVnQ here's another  Thousands of years of war and divide leading millions if not billions to their death over filthy religious foundations of factually proven lies and we still have people clinging to religion like a dung beetle clings to it's food all the while continuing to demonstrate ignorance towards what fact has already proven because lets face it ignorance is religions ""ONLY"" defense. Lets take a look into the shame of those who continue to degrade themselves by claiming to be religious.  Everything in the bible (or any other book of any other religion for that matter) aside from the fundamental lie of that religion was stolen from society, from the paranormal, from the Earth itself, from the dead and from the living. the religious steal every name they like to attribute what they steal to their foundation of factually proven lies, They steal the cross from the dead and try to attribute it to their foundation of lies.  A thousands years before some human carved out of stone what they call the ten commandments, do you think that you would want your possessions stolen, your family killed etc. Long before some guy got what the religious call crucified, the cross was used to mark a grave of the dead simply because if you see a stick poking out of the ground you may not think much of it but if you see another stick fixed crossing it you would then recognize the significance of a grave for thousands of years before some guy got crucified then they with a stolen cross use it to propagate their religious foundations of lies.  The religious steal everything they can from society, every story within any religious scripture etc. is stolen from society and is sickly twisted with lies to propagate that religions foundation of lies.  The religious steal Morality from humans and still to this day they attempt to attribute what they steal from us to their sickly devised foundations of factually proven lies.  These are the tools that the selfish and the greedy use to take advantage of those from a time of weakness for power and control over the many.  What was your weakness, were you an innocent little baby? Did you just lose a loved one? Were you lonely? Were you homeless or starving was you time of weakness when the religious preyed upon you? Did you just get raped? Did you just get in or out of jail?~ could be a time of weakness for some. Did you see some eye candy walk into some religious filth hole? the list goes on.  It is sickening, it has make the world sick for thousands of years and it has got to stop so that we may all then finally move on after thousands of years of war and divide leading to the death of millions if not billions over nothing more than foolish pathetic yet deceptive filthy religious factually proven foundations of lies.  The foundation of every religion is some ridiculous story about how everything came to be. Again I will include the non contestable factual information that proves every religion is based upon a foundation of lies within this very article.  The non contestable factual evidence which proves the foundation of every religion is based upon lies with an additional paragraph for support:  It takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter, not anything goes poof into existence out of nothingness and not anything that exists goes poof into nothingness which is proof that energy matter and time always was, is and always will be because the only thing that doesn't change is that change occurs and that is because energy matter and time are always present. Nothing is able to come into existence, let alone be able to process a thought or put that thought into motion via action without there first be the energy matter and time it takes to re create energy and matter which proves that there is no such thing as a god. (foundation of religion is some ridiculous story of how we / everything came to be!  Which is the very non contestable evidence which not only so easily proves that there is no such thing as a god, but that the very foundation / fundamental of every religion is based upon lies.  At best there is some alien life form [of which again ""For anything to first develop intelligence, or come into existence to develop an intelligence, or use that intelligence come up with a plan or put that plan into motion (to first be able to create / re create) it takes three things, it takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter.""] taking credit for what even created it thus proving again this alien is no more than a liar for taking credit for what even created it / us and everything throughout the universe in it's present form!  Praying or worshiping is a disgusting sign of ignorance towards respecting your environments for what they do or do not provide for you. All these people of all of these religions who's fundamental is a lie known as god pray to or worship this lie/god thus acknowledging that they also believe that this lie/god has intellect to be able to understand worship or prayers to begin with. Yet for anything to first come into existence to be able to develop an intellect or to use that intellect to put a plan into motion thus re create with the energy and matter already present, it first takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter for any of this to first occur because again not anything goes poof into existence out of nothingness and not anything that exists goes poof into nothingness. Paragraph for support:  I have noticed that upon several occasions during interaction with people on various web sites that immediately after reading that which has already been shared, they then have the nerve to ignore that which was already in what they just read and ask me well where did energy and matter come from then? The answer as already revealed within that very demonstration: Proof that energy matter and time always was, is and always will be is that it takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter. Again not anything goes poof into existence out of nothingness and not anything that exists goes poof into nothingness. You want to contest any of this as fact then quite simply share one factual example of anything going poof into existence out of nothingness or just one factual example of anything that exists going poof into nothingness. No one ever will share even one example and I know this quite simply because the fact remains that it takes energy matter and time to re create energy and matter!  Just because we all suffered war and divide over filthy religious lies for thousands of years because previous generations were too ignorant too address this problem appropriately doesn't mean we have to drag our future generations down / dump this garbage on them! Our future generations deserve better as does all life on this planet that ever existed!  The question is do you value lies more than you value life, and if you value life than you must realize that the only place for religion is in the garbage.  Remember, if you decide to continue to cling to religion like a dung beetle clings to it's food just remember you encourage lies and deception for power and control over the many from a time of weakness which has lead the globe to war and divide for thousands of years and yes again to the death of millions if not billions over pathetic filthy lies, but me I am not weak and I see through all the fundamental lies of all / every religion and that is just for starters.

Not all life forms grow in the sense of term we are using here so that one will have to be ignored, it was an unnecessary and unsufficient criteria to start with. Everything changes so continual change will also be ignored. We are left with reproduction and functional activity, and we have to find something that fits both these criteria. Computer viruses are capable of reproducing, and they are capable of functional activity. Since computer viruses follow both your criteria, following your definition of life, they must be alive. We wouldn't however call computer viruses living, so that means there's something wrong with your criteria.	You even keep bringing up the things you describe as non-living, but it clearly exist. There is obviously a difference between living and existing because not everything that exist is non living and not everything that exist is living.	0

Well how about gay marraige isn't good because why do you need to get married it isn't like you can make babies, why not stay dating	If this is an argument it must be applied to marriage as a whole, the infertile also cannot have babies, old women cannot have babies. If marriage is about having children, then why not also fight for fertility tests before every person gets married? That is why i would say this argument fails. The argument is used against Gay marriage, but its effect on Heterosexual marriage is just ignored. why not stay dating Why should Gays just remain dating? Many Gay couples may just want to remain dating, but many want to get married because they want their relationship to be recognised in the same way as their straight counterpart. Many also want to show their commitment through a marriage and there is no decent argument against them being allowed this.	0

"First of all, ya morons, if we were debating on God's existence, we would have to accept that if he did exist, we would NOT understand his true intentions. We're human beings that are limited by the physical realm. God is supposed to be supernatural and powerful and shit. So saying ""if God does exist, he's an asshole for letting evil happen"" is admitting that you're an ignorant fool who isn't serious about reasoning. You missed the underlying point. If a god is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, then evil cannot exist. It's a matter of logic. The converse is true: if evil exist, said god could not exist."

First  flame wars and 'revenge' debates (I'm looking at you, Dana). (s)Yea, that's not ironic.(/s) But as for the debate question, there are some debates for intellectual purposes, just as there is some drama. It depends on which debates you go on. The more emotional people often bring emotional drama with them, but they don't stand for all of us when it comes to the topics at hand. I never upvote arguments with no logic in them even if they are for my side. Just as their is some people who use rational, logical arguments, ground in fact but they also don't stand for the entire community.

This is true, but they won't know if they are gay or straight when they read 'married' on their drivers license or wherever they had to put it. Can I ask how old you are? Because most people know you don't put your relationship status on your drivers license. Actually, it really doesn't go anywhere except on face book. Some jobs ask if you have a family to know how easy it would be to relocate you, but thats about it.  So why can't they have this useless title, if it's not harming anyone? I never said they couldn't. I'm against all government intervention when it comes to marriage, I just found the cartoon (and the cartoonist) to be misleading. I can't really think of any other examples of being in a civil union being as discriminated against except for job opportunities. Again, most jobs don't ask for your relationship status or sexuality, some just want to know if you have a family because of relocation, travel and overtime.	Can I ask how old you are?

Firstly: Why are women committing suicide? Well, let's just think about it. Imagine a woman aborting her child because that child is female, and then imagine that woman having to live with the guilt of her decision. Imagine a woman who desperately wants her daughter, but has that daughter forcibly stripped from her womb. Imagine a Chinese girl growing up knowing that her parents wished she were a boy, because then she would have a greater value. These circumstances probably can be attributed greatly to the one-child policy. In this way, the policy directly contributes to elevation of males above females and it's easy to see the results.

Which is why one cannot draw an absolute conclusion. If people were arguing in the form of: There is no absolute answer, but I think blah blah blah. Then I wouldn't dispute them. But we have some people making absolute conclusions, which I see as false.	But something such as murder is seen as unethical in everyone's view (unless they're insane). To discuss how ethical eugenics is, we need to point out what it could lead to.  For example in Hitler's case it lead to genocide. Which many people consider unethical.	0
No the idea is an atrocious one. Duly noted. The idea of knowing my nurse drawing my blood actually graduated by taking a speedy course isn't a very comforting idea. Though that might be the idea running through your head it is a misconception. As all nurses, along with any field within the medical sphere, must pass all tests both taken online and physically ( hands on ) to pass the course and become certified. Online just helps speed up the process. Basically allowing any people who are diligent workers to take and finish their course in a faster time than in a regular class room setting.	-Duly noted.- You wouldn't happen to be a jackass would you? My thought process is not flawed, it just did not contain any good sources of information and was a reply to your question off the top of my head. I can get more in depth if you want... You mentioned those who are diligent workers, what about those who are not?  Speeding up the process is usually not a good thing when it comes to schooling, at least from my experience. My main problem with any online course is that students may find themselves unable to resist the answers to the times test sitting their on their computer behind another tab, or even their friend who happened to pass the course in a class room. I also find problems with never actually seeing your teacher, though you may see him/her once in a blue moon that does not lead to a healthy relationship between a student in need of help a good percentage of the time with a professor who is drinking whiskey at his house.	0

"Science is an intrinsically godless process.

The scientific method automatically assumes a naturalistic cause for everything, otherwise there is no point in doing science."	"""Science is an intrinsically godless process."" I never said it wasn't.  And that doesn't mean that one can't believe in both. You don't use music to solve a math problem but one could still argue that they are related. There are a certain number of notes in a song. There are diffident patterns of notes that equate to certain songs. So it's like trying to separate math and music.  ""The only reason you have a computer is because one of our ancestors decided to actually find out how the world works instead of shrugging and going ""goddiddit""."" I too believe that it is useless to just say ""goddidit"" along with all the other Christians I know. Most Christians (that I know)don't think like that. Try to be hypothetical for a second; if there was a god wouldn't he want us to try to figure some things out for ourselves instead of just telling us how everything works?  You should decide to actually find out what people around you believe instead of shrugging and going ""they're stupid"" that's not very scientific is it? Do you think it is? I really want to know. I wan't to know how scientific it is to assume the beliefs of others. Tell me.  ""The scientific method automatically assumes a naturalistic cause for everything"" Well, you are right that we can't find out scientifically how everything was created.

In REALITY, women tend to be more afraid of rats and shit and men tend to be less afraid. Hell, in REALITY, men will usually pick up the rat and scare the shit out of the women with it.

This is just wrong all together. Cougars and MILFs are becoming more and more popular, so there's no way that aging females are becoming de-sexualized. Although, I'm not a MILF hunter. Sorry, but women do get less sexy as they get older. But, the entertainment industry definitely isn't de-sexifying them. 6. WTF? Wear? Are you referring to that thing that happened wear women were dead and shit as models? That was invented by a gay dude and a lesbian. If not, than what? AberCrombie and Finch did that once and got in trouble for it (their ads are mainly dudes, anyway). The people who control the imagery are mainly gays and women. Except for porn, of course (but in porn, gays are usually the photographers and they set the scene, but lets say that the fact that it's a man and men are sexist pigs, okay)."	You are wrong on every single point. Cite credible sources, or else you are just spewing more sexism out your ass.	0
Evidence is not proof, so that would be one way to believe in something without proof. Another is just from the perception you get by hearing people talking about something.

so it never occurred to you that i don't believe in any god? Determinism is by its very nature theistic. because that is logically inconsistent with the assertion that god cannot (or does not) violate free will. If God cannot do so then he is not omnipotent, something which conflicts with the notion of a deism.  one cannot be all loving, all powerful and indifferent to the suffering of untold millions of children. Why not?	'If God cannot do so then he is not omnipotent, something which conflicts with the notion of a deism.' So jehovah is a deistic god? i was under the impression that he is a personal theistic god of the anthropomorphic variety.  I am not a theist, or a deist. I have no belief in a god, mainly due to lack of evidence but all the logical inconsistencies born out of the things attributed to the abrahamic god, only make god look even less likely to actually exist. It is the contention of christians that god cannot violate free will. any and all other logical inconsistencies only add to the problem.  if you dont understand why omnibenevolence and indifference are incompatible, youre short because i wont waste any time explaining something so blatantly obvious.	0

P.S.: I prefer characters who aren't overpowered and can god-mode out of anything. Try writing a decent character for a change; reading the descriptions for both of these made some of my brain cells commit suicide.	Well when you look at their capabilities, they both seem extremely powerful, but there are several ways to get around their abilities. Kururai mainly uses his speed to get around, but Koguja has clairvoyance. Kururai follows the laws of physics (for the most part) and has a hard time being able to see where he's going. He must predict where to stop, etc.. Also, in the RP, you can be extremely powerful, but the moderators on it limit how powerful you can be. For example, there is one person who can copy other's abilities, and turns into glass right before dying :/ Kururai actually obtained a lot of those stronger abilities throughout playing the RP, eventually learning things. Koguja's name means Collector, which hints at his multiple weapons with sealing capabilities. He essentially collects weapons with the ability to seal another's ability. The fairest I can see the battle happening is: Koguja uses his Zanpakuto and seals Kururai's speed. He uses another sword and seals Kururai's aether control. After, Koguja seals Kururai's instant heal. All Kururai has left is Dragon shouts, luck, teleportation, and a vast amount of weapons (and of course, basic things that come with his weapons, like Kido (Zanpakuto) and Keyblade Magic (Keyblade)) Koguja still has spell casting, dragon shouts, arrancar/SOLDIER physique, and clairvoyance (basic other stuff such as Keyblade Magic and Kido)	0

If there is no God, we lose the very standard by which we critique religions and religious people, so whose opinion matters most? Whose voice will be heard? Whose tastes or preferences will be honored? In the long run, human tastes and opinions have no more weight than we give them, and who are we to give them meaning anyway? Who is to say that lying, or cheating or adultery or child molestation are wrong –really wrong? Where do those standards come from? Sure, our societies might make these things “illegal” and impose penalties or consequences for things that are not socially acceptable, but human cultures have at various times legally or socially disapproved of everything from believing in God to believing the world revolves around the sun; from slavery, to interracial marriage, from polygamy to monogamy. Human taste, opinion law and culture are hardly dependable arbiters of Truth.	"""If there is no God, we lose the very standard by which we critique religions and religious people, so whose opinion matters most?"" Nothing changes. The religious exist whether or not God does. The atheist, not believing in God, still critiques religions and religious people. As far as whose opinion matters most, well that's rather subjective. We each form our own judgments on that. ""Whose voice will be heard?"" Probably the one that shouts the loudest. ""Whose tastes or preferences will be honored?"" Same as now. As long as your tastes or preferences don't cause harm to society or other people, why not allow them? ""In the long run, human tastes and opinions have no more weight than we give them, and who are we to give them meaning anyway?"" Mostly true. Too bad we can't ask the founders of religions those questions.  ""Who is to say that lying, or cheating or adultery or child molestation are wrong –really wrong?"" Anyone who has experienced these things. Most atheists don't care for these things either. They destabilize society. ""Where do those standards come from?"" Our brain and our genetics: <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=3&ref;=science.'>http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=3&ref;=science.

It sometimes takes awhile, but we usually get pretty good at weeding out the more destructive behaviors.  Also, life is change. Some things that were once viable no longer are.

"As stated, I am talking about ""the existence of God(s)"". The debate description merely gets specific ON SOME POINTS that will be brought up during debate. Even so, it all doesn't matter. Unless you understand a religion up to a point where others will believe that YOU believe in it (when describing it), you will not be able to debunk a religion.  Right, but don't you think that when discussing god you should frame it within the debate topic?"	"The debate topic also mentioned secular ethics. My stance stands. While it's possible that MAYBE someone has a point when pointing out all the omnis and if they can be true as characteristics of God, it is not a ""coherent argument against the existence of God(s)""."	0
There have actually been scientific studies that have supported the idea that humans are actually polygamous. Throughout most of history they have been. The most powerful guy in the village would have more wives because he would make a better provider.	"He only had more wives because he COULD provide for more, not because he made provision for more. ""Can do"" and ""should do"", even on the most basic moral value system are completely seperate concepts altogether. Again, I think the words monogamous and polygamous are being misused here, and just because humans have tendancy to have multiple partners does not make it effective. It's human nature to punch someone in the face when they are angry, that doesn't mean its okay, or even wise. I should find it paradoxical that a society that exhaults mankind's nature far above the nature of animals cannot even meet that standard, much less surpass it."	0

Gender roles can be quite damaging to society and as a result should be neglected when describing a persons role in life. I recomend reading some of Adrienne Rich's poetry. Much of her work is based on her peronal experience with the stereotypical roles associated with women in the 50's and 60's, and how surpressed and powerless she felt.	Yes they can be very damaging to society and it also depends on what kind of person you are, and what you are doing. Women that feel powerless don't need to feel that way. They can always find ways to gain power in other areas... does it really have to be all about work? Talents are a great way to feel a sense of power and accomplishment.	0
I believe it is reasonable to expect celebrities to be good role models because without fans they would not survive. Esp. if the celebrity is in the spotlight of children like a disney character YES children are looking up to you!	"Yes, but my question is why? I admit that when I was little I thought celebrities like Hilary Duff were so cool and I was interested to watch interviews from them and stuff, but I never really wanted to be like them. There's a difference. I don't understand where that desire comes from, and I think that even if children are at an impressionable age, parents are at least somewhat capable of intervening and teaching kids that they should want to be like teachers, older siblings, and other people that they see every day. Also, I don't understand your first sentence. What do you mean when you say that celebrities need fans to ""survive""?"	0
Do you mean that Atheism is some sort of post-christianity? - with the morals but discarding the fantasy?? Without being too critical of both Atheists and Christians, both terms indicate conclusions of the mind predicated upon supposed facts. The facts, as it were, lead to contradictory conclusions; however, the conclusions are not necessarily valid inferences of what is to be thought of as fact. Or, explained another way:  There may be in fact a logical validation of the existence of an Alpha Creator, if you will; but, the position of the Atheist, in contradiction of the Christian, contradicts only the Christian definition of God. Example: God = Alpha Christian definition of God=Beta Atheist’s position, God= not Beta As long as Christians draw invalid inferences, via deductive reasoning, or specifically the lack thereof, the Atheist view point only contradicts the invalid inference of the Christian. And consequently both camps are disputing a falsity. The atheist contradicts, validly I might add, the Christian definition of God. But atheism is not a valid contradiction of a valid definition of God.  Now, having slightly elaborated my viewpoint I submit the following proposition: The validity of the Atheist position concerning God is no more true or false than the Christian definition of God. So, in conclusion the Atheistic viewpoint only contradicts the Christian definition of God. In answer to your first question I will simply say that some Atheists are more moral than some of their Christian counterparts, and that, without so much mysticism.  If I understand you correctly, I would rather say that the scientific method is the mother of atheism. That is fine, but I will submit unto you that I think you would disagree with that statement after some additional facts. #1 The scientific method is an instrument for knowledge by the rationality of a sound mind. #2 The current Atheistic viewpoint is the consequent contradiction of the Christian definition of God. And finally, Atheism (as defined) exists only by reason of a contradiction of the notion of God; for without the notion of God no Atheist can contradict a viewpoint that does not exist. If the thoughts of God and religion were none existent then so to shall be the viewpoint of an Atheist. The scientific method does not create an Atheist, it produces sound knowledge apart from unreasonable reason (oxymoron). I can discuss that matter in even greater detail if so be you would care to.	"I think you're using a very selective definition of atheism. Atheism can refer anyone in any cultural context that doesn't believe in a god(monotheism) or gods(polytheism), of any kind. I understand we are seeped in this ""western"" context of christianity, but does that really mean a ""self proclaimed atheist"" in some other religious region is standing in direct opposition to Christianity? I don't think so. Atheist aren't making a counter claim regardless of the dichotomy of the labels. Atheism/theism concerns belief, as opposed to gnosticism/agnosticism which is an epistemological term concerning knowledge. To me, everyone is agnostic because I think no one living knows for certain if there is a god. Christians believe they are gnostic because they see the bible as evidence. Atheists have no belief in god/s due to their perceived lack of evidence. This is the default position since no claim is being made. Theism, no matter the form, makes the claim for god/s or the supernatural. Without evidence there is no reason to believe this claim, but note I did not say that it was warranted to believe that god/s cannot exist. Atheism is not a belief structure.  If the thoughts of God and religion were none existent then so to shall be the viewpoint of an Atheist. This is the basis for atheist blowback. There isn't a word for the lack of belief in Santa Claus. Atheists are a much derided minority, especially in the south where I live. There are still states that do not allow us to serve in government openly. Minorities when threatened band together. Modern atheism is a reaction, nothing more. If theism disappears, the illusion of an atheist collective will disappear. Then we finally realize we were all Pantheists anyway as our ideas of god merges with our ideas of the universe. I think some of the upcoming breakthroughs in quantum mechanics will pretty much assure this."	0
I like both but only have a cat because I don't have the time to take care of a dog... the walking, and letting it out to do it's business. I like how cats can basically take care of themselves.	"Well, that's a great thing that I would like to hear from more people. The decision of having a certain pet based on your own availability and your living space is something 99% of the people don't do, but should do. A dog is made to run free with his ""family"" and suffers from being left alone and in small spaces (even small dogs). Dogs can suffer from depression, but many people don't know that. A cat is pretty much the choice for an apartment. He's a good company as well, he plays with you, and when you go out, he's ok with that. And he also can be left outside and it'll be ok with him. I prefer dogs mainly because they are more like your close buddy. I have dogs because I have a big backyward, otherwise I wouldn't have them."	0

Let's say if God did speak and He used men to do it, like you use your computer to speak for you, do you think we could tell the difference between what men write and what men under the control of God write.

"I use my computer to communicate, because I am not omnipotent, If I was then I could communicate telepathically, but I am not omnipotent am I?

If I told you you have the freedom of choice on what soda to drink, then its common sense to assume that not wanting to drink soda would be an option. The same goes with freedom of religion.

Isn't that more closely what is meant by ""freedom from religion?"" I think we need to be careful in what we argue is ""freedom from religion."" It doesn't mean that you are free not to follow a religion, it traditionally means that you are free from any religious activities in the public sphere (no prayers at a school, even if not school sponsored for example). Finally, even if we accepted your definition, that wouldn't mean they are equivalent, but rather that the latter is a variant under the former."	0

And where did those morals come from? And so on and on. This is a common argument. It is true that even nomads had a certain degree of morality. But you are missing my point. I am not saying that all morals are directly influenced from religion. Religion helped spread certain morals. Our ancestors lived in a world governed by religion. Now you may think religion is a tool of mental coercion, but imagine if there were never any religions. There could be some positive aspects, but there would also be very many negatives as well. What is right and wrong would not be as emphasized as it currently is.   Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). It is pretty well-known, that the world was once a much more sexist place. Men saw women as lower than them (this is still relevant today if you look at NewLee's debates), and rather than marriage being purely out of love, it was more of way for men to claim a woman as their property. Now you can argue that maybe stealing was seen as immoral before religion, thus meaning that adultery is a form of stealing, but I think it stemmed more from disappointment. For example, say you are a caveman who just made a new tool. This tool gets the job done and you find that you are satisfied with the results it gives you. You go to sleep and awake a few hours later to find that one of the other cavemen stole it. Now ignoring the fact that a caveman wasn't nearly as intelligent as we are today, he would not have looked at the other caveman and considered what he had done to be wrong or immoral, he would have been upset that his tool that he enjoyed so much, is now being used by somebody else... Not him. What is moral and what is immoral, were labels developed by religions. Influenced yes. Dictated morally? Not at all. Not at all? Now that is something you cannot know. Like I've already said, not all morals come directly from religions, but many do. No. Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). Without religion, adultery would not be a term. Even under a different name, it still would not exist. Marriage stems from religion. Adultery stems from marriage. Commiting adultery is breaking one of the ten commandments. So marriage came from religion, and so did adultery... so how is adultery not one of the morals gained from religion? As for the religious figureheads commiting the most bizarre cases of adultery, well then they obviously aren't the most faithful followers of their religion, are they?	"Religion helped spread certain morals This could be said of any social institution, making this a meaningless proposition.  Now you may think religion is a tool of mental coercion, but imagine if there were never any religions. There could be some positive aspects, but there would also be very many negatives as well. I can't think of a single negative to a society governed by reason and voluntary cooperation rather than mysticism and authority.  What is right and wrong would not be as emphasized as it currently is.  But right and wrong aren't emphasized whatsoever, and society is becoming completely consumed by relativism. And who can blame it when the strongest voice of objective moral values is not only not objective but proposes horrible standards for any society to be based on?  Not him. You're whole scenario showcases the social contract at its conceptual stage.  What is moral and what is immoral, were labels developed by religions. A moral code is a system of teleological measurement which grades the choices and actions open to man, according to the degree to which they achieve or frustrate the code’s standard of value. The standard is the end, to which man’s actions are the means. A moral code is a set of abstract principles; to practice it, an individual must translate it into the appropriate concretes—he must choose the particular goals and values which he is to pursue. This requires that he define his particular hierarchy of values, in the order of their importance, and that he act accordingly. ""Concepts of Consciousness"" Not at all? Now that is something you cannot know. As an Objectivist it is a claim I can make quite strongly: <a href='http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/ayn-rand/objectivism.asp'>http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/ayn-rand/objectivism.asp  Without religion, adultery would not be a term. This is inconsequential as the implications of both marriage and adultery can and are present devoid of any religious influence.  well then they obviously aren't the most faithful followers of their religion, are they?

"I edited my first statement to your response by the time I finished you already responded, I edited it so i could get to the point more quickly and to clarify what I mean.

"Okay so you are saying evil is necessary for us to learn and grow, and that is all fine and good in moderation, I will give you that, evil is necessary for us to distinguish good. But what do you have to say to little Timmy who got cancer and will die at 5 years of age, or 4 year old Juan who was killed in an earthquake. What did they learn from their experience, how did they grow? No other person did this to them, it just happened, and why them? you could say bad luck or coincidence but you religious folk aren't too fond of coincidences now are you. So why would an all powerful and loving god allow this 5 year old, innocent child to die? And these circumstances are by no means isolated incidents, this type of tragic death happens on a daily basis around the world. Now it seems like you are just making excuses for this god of yours. It sounds like a battered wife trying to defend her abusive husband. ""Oh he didn't mean to hit me offica, it was ma fault, I just din't have dinner on the table at 6:30 like he likes it, he's warned me several times offica."" Either own up and admit your husband is a dick or the much more realistic situation, your husband doesn't exist and terrible things happen in the world because ""evil"" as we perceive it to be, is natural in the world.  And please stop with the ""oh well god is out of our understanding and knows and created everything so his reasoning is exempt from our scorn"" crap. If i made the claim to you that I was my own father, and you pointed out that it was biologically and physically impossible for that to happen, I could just say that ""us self fathering people are outside of physics and genetics as YOU understand it, but we live by a different set of rules."" I would mocked into obscurity and i would deserve it, you cannot exclude god from these arguments simply by retreating to the substance less backup of a lack of ""well he is god so he MUST have logic we cannot comprehend."""	I think it would be good for you to read the book of job in the bible, not for spiritual reasons nessisarily but because it shows true humility. Trail is also how we show our algence to God. Think about this, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or Mormon as we are often called.  Our first modern prophet, Joseph Smith Jr. went through hell to bring our church to the world. We were driven from state to state in a countary that claimed to have religious freedom, and yet we never let go of our God. We were persecuted and killed for sport. Our leaders were tared and feathered, our members tossed into jail for mearly believeing in the Book of Mormon. Our prophet lost 3 children when they were very young to illness and he was martered in Liberty Jail along with his brother and some other leaders of our church at the time, now years and years later we are a thriveing church with many many memebers world wide because of the sacrifices that Joseph Smith made. Yes it is sad that children and others get cancer or have other illnesses, It makes me very sad but illness is part of life and everyone's situation is different. My older sister died as a baby, I feel sorry that I will never know her,but I take comfort in knowing that God has taken her into his care and she is happy and safe.	0

What in me is evidence of a god? Many would argue the fantastic complexity of your body, but this argument is lost on you. But there are others, albiet possibly weak arguments. I'll list a few with breif descriptions. 1) Vestigial organs. If evolution were true, we'd have loads. But we don't have any. Things thought to be vestigial in the past have been found to have functions. 2) Vestigial DNA. Same argument as above, but this one has semi-less merit. We only know what a fraction of our DNA does, and the rest is considered 'junk', or vestigial. That would be acceptable, except for the presence of Pyknons [1]. 3) Living transitional species. Once again, probably weak, but it would seem that if evolution happened once, it could, and should happen again. But we only see pure species, not to mention wholly developed organs. Such design implies a creator. 3.1) Rebuttal: but our genetic code is so much the same that it implies we had the same ancestors. Counter-rebuttal: My house and the house across the street are probably made from around 99% of the same material, and yet are vastly different constructions. This is due to a designer. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. These aren't solid arguments, but they're a start.	Vestigial organs are not necessarily 'useless' organs. Something labeled vestigial just means it is no longer used in the way it probably originally was, in a way we see it used in the rest of the animal kingdoms. Penguins have vestigial wings but they are certainly not useless.  You continue to talk about 'pure' species. What, exactly, does this mean to you? All extant species are nothing but another step in the endless process of evolution, no more or less 'pure' in breeding than their ancient ancestors or future descendants. We are the 'transitional forms' of future species. The only thing that could make any of them special is the ability of humans to assign subjective value to the world in which they live.	0

1. a) Yes there is: Number of murders per 100,000 USA = 6, Switzerland = 2.9 England = 1.5. England is empirically safer, I have a lower chance of getting murdered. <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/oct/13/homicide-rates-country-murder-data'>http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/                                       2009/oct/13/homicide-rates-country-murder-data   b) My point is that it is not that 'the guns are in the hands of the criminals' as there are fewer criminals in Switzerland than either US or UK, the guns are in the hands of ordinary law abiding citizens, but the fact they are out there = crimes of passion = dead pool boys. 2. My point there is that the argument it is a barrier to tyranny does not hold water as your pea shooter doesn't have a chance against an abrams, you can't vote for guns to be used against the government while simultaneously voting for more money to the government so they can arm themselves better. We have a very small armed force who frankly wouldn't have chance of oppressing the will of the people guns or no. 3. Yes an amendment is a part of the thing it is amending, but amendment means - change, ergo it can be changed!!!	1) a) Ah, countries that have always had lower murder rates still have lower murder rates. England's murder rate has gone up since they have had gun control. You can't just compare them across, America has always been more violent, but the murder rate has been going down lately and we don't have gun control. b) You didn't address my issue, so it seems I am right there. Let's go with your ridiculous scenario. A guy walks in on his wife and she is having sex with another guy, but he doesn't have guns. Ok, they get away and the husband is perfectly happy and everything is fine ... NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! He hunts that bastard down eventually and cuts his throat. Just because revenge takes time doesn't mean it won't happen. 2) You have no point. I can't vote for taking away my guns AND giving money to the government for defense because then there is no chance for me. I either vote for both or vote for neither, but I would like the countries defense to be strong against other countries. 3) I misread you statement earlier. The word amendment implies it can be changed, not that it should be changed. You have provided no such reasoning for changing an amendment let alone the one that allows all the others to exist.	0
The fetus is, by all scientific standards, a living human being. Our justice system is wrought with error. There. I refuted it both ways.	"""The fetus is, by all scientific standards, a living human being."" Not everybody believes this. There are even a few people out there that don't consider a baby ""alive"" until birth! I think life starts at conception (human life), but the liberal argument is that there comes a point where the ""clump of cells"" becomes a human. I think the most common time frame for this might be 8 weeks because it's the first heartbeat and brain activity. ""Our justice system is wrought with error."" It's not perfect, but conservatives have enough trust in it to put to death a man for slaughtering his entire family. Of course, not too many people want to use the death penalty for minor offenses. Some of the only cases that warrant capital punishment are those that involve cruel and viscous first degree murder."	0

"Note: 'by the minority' in the case of the US revolution was the justification precisely that laws were being enforced without the consent of the majority? ""No taxation without etc....""

Just look at the tax base of most of the EU and tell me they aren't socialist. I mean, christ, in France its nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get fired, thanks to the social safety net. Also, the Euro experiences growth rates about 1% under the US. They don't grow as fast as we do here. And it's mainly due to their tax system. Just look at how taxes are done in the UK and tell me there's some semblance of spending control or logic. A big part of that has to do with their spending on medical care for the country. Listen, this is what's going to happen (you can quote me on it) as governments get less revenue and medical care costs move higher (thanks to an aging population and a slowdown in population growth) the government will have to either tax more or eliminate benefits. This is going to seriously change how medical care is taken care of in European and Japanese nations.	The tax base indeed, but not the means of production. There are socialist elements - but the economy is undoubtedly capitalist. The EU is a massive effort to expand the European Market. No one's saying topple the capitalist system. It has already won. Just because it has won, doesn't mean that it couldn't survive reform that would help its participants. Do you seriously think that a differential of 1% is a significant figure? We are number one in the world economically. But other nations take a relatively close second. And they do so by making sure that all of their people are taken care of. Imagine if your annual health bill were only 1% of your income. Would you really take umbrage at this? I am listening and I don't agree with what you're saying. Medical care costs will move higher, but decline after the baby boom generation and level off since we have a 2.1% replacement rate. Most importantly these people are already covered under the current system! This critique has only an oblique relationship to universalizing health care. Regardless, we can still expand the system in the face of rising costs as well. We could keep the system skeletal and cover the basics, and cut spending on more expensive, riskier procedures. Further, incorporating more people into the system would lower costs by lowering risks and increasing the number of contributors.  Indeed, if cuts in benefis are not possible, then taxes will have to go up. But here's the thing. The brunt of the tax burden wouldn't (or shouldn't) be on middle and lower classes: it would be on those who can bare - at no relative inconvenience - the costs. Companies and economies in Europe and Japan have managed to become leaders in the world - they face burdens yes, but no one wants to get rid of universal coverage.	0

No one is keeping them down, except for certain insane people. I'm not guilty of anything.	"""You can't help being black."" Of course I can't. But, the fact you worded it like that made it sound like being black is a bad thing. ""White guilt IS over, at least for me."" Good for you! Just because you believe its nonexistent doesn't mean it isn't tangible. ""If you try hard, you can be anything you want to. Life isn't easy for anything, so you gotta work hard."" You say life isn't easy for anything but such quote has been detested by numerous of people. Life isn't easy but some people have it more worse than others and even in vice versa. ""If you wanna be president, you gotta work hard."" Well of course. But, its much harder when you are president. But how is this at all relevant to the topic? ""You wanna be a scientist, you gotta be smart."" Common Sense... ""There are gifted black scientists and black presidents. "" Yes, there is a minuscule percentage of African Americans who managed to overlie many hardships and achieve a great life. I didn't face as many hardships because I live in this generation where things are not black and white as much as they use to be because things are getting better but as things get better so does the worse. But what the hell? Black president(s), no, there is only one registered African American president in the American History, his name is Barack Obama. The fact you only say ""scientist"" than the over 100 occupations we have in this country makes me shudder. I mean, not every single black woman and man are going to be scientist. Please give examples too... ""No one is keeping them down, except for certain insane people."" Well that made no sense. Just because your racist doesn't make you insane and its only racist people that are 'keeping them down.' Tommy Hilfger stated that he wouldn't let any black people wear his clothes and he is perfectly sane. So yes, people are keeping blacks down. Black models were turned down by Tommy Hilfger because of their race.  ""I'm not guilty of anything."" I never said you were guilty of anything. I said a quantity of your race is and by the looks of your argument, you did not even refuted a single point I had. You had really no evidence whatsoever and some points were irrelevant."	0
"I do not think that Puerto Rico should become a state of the United States mostly do to costs. As it is, our economy is doing horribly right now, but that's another argument. Puerto Rico, at the moment, gets food stamps, welfare, voting privileges, and many of the things we, (the US citizens) get, without having to pay taxes. Why buy the cow, when the milk is free? Another change required would be changing our flag. Each star represents a state and each stripe one of the original 13 colonies. This would cost even more money. Lastly, I believe that Puerto Rico and the United States are doing fine how they are, so why try to change things? Although, America does not have an ""official language"" the majority of people speak English. Many Puerto Ricans do not even know English. They have their own cultural traditions and although they are very welcome here, I do not believe we should merge. - Cristal L."	Well don't you pay for milk? Yes, in Puerto Rico they do get the same things without paying taxes but they also don't get to vote even though they are being ran by the U.S. government.

"A firmament never existed at any time. Light cannot come before the sun. A God didnt poof the world into existence. 2 people didnt give birth to the entire lineage of the human race. The world was never flooded. THeres no evidence for a god poofing anything into existence ever. A pile of dirt cannot form into a man nor the ingredients in dirt. Likewise woman cannot come from 1 rib bone. Evolution does not in any way corrolate with genesis nor does the big bang. You made that up and are wrong. I am hoping you understand what firmament actually means. One did exists then. God made heaven first before the sun. Logically there would be light so they can see. Therefore God made light in the heavens before he made them to shine for earth. Adam and Eve probably didn't but science has that weird thing in it too because according to science mating which you sister may produce offspring with a few disabilities.There would have to be a lot of incest in order to stabilize a population. I don't know if the world was flooded or not. I haven't seen any evidence for or against yet so I have no clue. You can't have evidence for a deity ""poofing"" things into existence. How would you? You are the creation of the deity so how would you even know? A pile of dirt may have started out as a bacteria and evolved from there and from that made Adam and Eve I don't know how it happened. I wasn't there. He didn't make it up really you just failed to think for a few seconds. You must be a hardcore Atheist."	"A firmament that separated the waters from the waters. As if there was almost like an ocean above and an ocean below. THIS NEVER EXISTED. For obvious reasons. One being that theres no proof a god poofed anything into existence and another that the intense greenhouse effect it caused would burn up all life on the planet.  As for the incest thing it would never stabalize... 2 people literally cannot spawn 7 billion people over ANY length of time. It just doesnt work. As for the flood. It never happened. Where did the water come from? No explaination. How did the saltwater or freshwater animals survive in brackish water? How did the non-sea plants and animals spawn after the flood? Where did the water go? No boat of the size in the book can hold that many animals, their food, feces, ect. Men dont live past 120 max EVER so noah was not 500 freaking years old. And ultimately the sediment layers studied by geologists disproves it entirely not to mention that we have writings from other places in the world at the same time as the flood and they never mention it or died. You can't have evidence for a deity ""poofing"" things into existence. How would you?  Exactly. so how can anyone propogate that they know for a fact that it happened? You are the creation of the deity so how would you even know? Im the creation of my mother and father and i know how it happened and that they both exist. The process was natural. Why should the creation of the universe be any different? Being a creation doesnt mean we CANT know. A pile of dirt may have started out as a bacteria and evolved from there and from that made Adam and Eve I don't know how it happened. Dirt came AFTER bacteria. What is dirt? Decayed plant and animal matter. We cant have plants and animals living and dying so much that it created dirt before we even had bacteria. And bacteria werent even the first creatures. The first protein strain had to exist. We dont know how it happened exactly but from that point we have a really solid recreation of how life evolved from step one. Nowhere does it include or ever need a god or any supernatural force. Im not trying to be mean when i say this but you have no idea how evolution nor abiogenesis works...  I wasn't there. Neither was I but i dont need to be. With science we can discover many things. And with logical thinking we can dismiss certain ideas. Combine the two and we have no need for a god. Hes out of the picture. He didn't make it up really you just failed to think for a few seconds. I dont need to think about it. Its entirely rediculous and ive also heard it tons of times before. Could a god exist? Sure its possible. But everything we know about the world. Every theory and law and finding all of it has natural causes and processes that explain it. Never once have we ever needed supernatural forces to explain something. So why should the beginning of the universe and planet Earth be any different? Occams razor. That says that it is more logical to begin with using the simplest explaination before moving on to more complicated ones. And it is more logical and simple to explain the evolution of our planet and the universe according to natural processes that align with EVERYTHING else we know instead of assuming some supernatural force that goes AGAINST everything we know poofed it into being. Not to mention we have evidence for our explaination and theres zero evidence for a god doing it. You must be a hardcore Atheist. If you wanna call it that. I perfer the term INFORMED atheist. I read and study scientific findings. I research things and read the works of prominent scientists and atheists and even creation scientists. I watch debates between theists and atheists to see whos side is stronger and i listen to people on here and debate with them. And every single time the atheistic side has come out on top. Every single time the creationist claim is destroyed by the REAL science. I wont ever say ""I know for a fact there is no god' that would be a lie. I dont know. but you dont know either. And no priest or pastor or pope does either. And no scientists for that matter. But i will say theres probably no god. I dont think there is one. THat is my opinion formed after years of study and the study i continue to do. Theres a whole world of information out there for you to assess. I suggest you take a look at it and decide for yourself instead of having other people decide for you. Im not making accusations, just observations."	0
Prove that God didn't make the big bang happen.	Because he said so. Literally on the first page on Genesis it says he made earth and heaven and blah blah blah.

If they exist, then why not? Isn't there quite a bit of evidence to suggest that - if the do exist - they have visited? One cannot travel at superluminal velocities, and traveling at our fastest ship speeds it would take around half a million years to reach the nearest solar system. Even if light speed were possible, many distances in space would take millions of years to reach, and there are also billions of galaxies with trillions of stars and so on. Our best hope would be that nearby solar systems have intelligent life, but that intelligent life would have to reach its apex of civilisation around the same time as us (that means within thousands of years out of hundreds of millions of years to choose from), and they would need to be able to travel near light speed to reach us within a decent time frame of hundreds or thousands of years. It's like trying to hit a bull's eye the size of a grain of sand over a mile away. Sure, interstellar contact may happen and probably has occurred numerous times in the universe, and will, but it's a vastly improbable event, simply due to timing. Intelligent life may be equally improbable, that is very hard to tell also. That's a ludicrous assumption; why is everything 'evil'? Is it because we know that we, ourselves, would treat aliens so horrible that they, too, must take on our 'evil tendencies'? Conquest is in the nature of life.	Conquest is in the nature of life. Of human life. Why does one always assume that it would be a 'nature of [alien] life'?	0

Bullshit. I see that you do not care about human rights. No one has the right to own a slave. People are not property. The government has the right to act when civil rights are in danger. Ayb a leik.	"I'm very glad that you are against slavery. However, you should be aware that the god you currently worship is not against it. He even says it's okay to beat your slaves as long as they don't die, and that they are ""property."" Here is a direct quote from him.  ""Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."" (Exodus 21:20-21)  <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21:20-21&version;=NIV'>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21:20-21&version;=NIV  You'll have to jump back to chapter 20 to see that it is god speaking.  I don't say this because I want you to think slavery is okay. I say this because most Christians don't seem to know the true character of their god. They only hear about the nice things. I think it's important to know that there is another side to him. Your statement ""I see that you do not care about human rights. No one has the right to own a slave."" should also be directed towards god. Please understand I don't say these things to be mean or critical of you, I just want to inform you that the god of the bible is not the kind and loving person most of us were taught about growing up. I highly recommend you study the old testament, and as you do ask yourself this question: Are these the actions of a kind and loving god?"	0
Look, school is for learning... You said that yourself... We also know that school is as much, if not more, about learning how to socially interact with others, as it is about learning about specific subjects. Sex is definitely a social interaction, yes? If so, when kids learn about it in school, they ought to learn how to protect themselves properly.  The concept of free condoms/ cheap, and readily available condoms is to teach the practice to even the kids that can't afford them. I buy my condoms, but if I was 15, and I only had 5 bucks to get me through the week, that money would be going to food, not protection. This obviously leads to a cycle where those that can't afford to have a baby, are more likely to have a baby, thus more likely to need government assistance to raise the baby. So why not just give out the condoms? It's way cheaper than the alternative.	"yes, teach them w/e you want, but waste millions of dollars on shit like that? please.  i believe in teaching kids how to use condoms, but it's pointless and expensive to provide free condoms w/e they request it. i don't believe in government assistance for dumb asses anyway. and seriously, how often is someone fucking if they can't afford condoms? most kids get pregnant cause they're stupid, not cause they're poor. no one ever said ""couldn't afford protection""."	0
I'm not saying I agree with the limitations on our speech I'm simply saying they are there. And the constitution never says specifically we can say what ever we want.

The constitution says you have the right to unabridged freedom of speech, what does that mean?	0
Finally an important debate. This is actually hard. I'm not going to yell and scream one guy is obviously better than the other because it simply is not true. I enjoy Picard's style. He's all refined then surprises you with some trick move at the end. Kirk does basically the same thing, but in a cavalier fashion. If they fell into some kind of time warp, and the Enterprises had to do battle, Kirk would win only because Spock would come up with some bullshit move - come back from the dead or some nonsense.	So are you suggesting that Spock is better than both of them????	0

beep bop boop Statements require proof. My prior statement will be revoked when proof is presented Boop end of transmission.	Okay, I mean it's pretty straightforward. This policy leads to a high rate of infanticide and abandonment, for one thing. Chinese women also have the highest suicide rate of any other country because this policy favors males so much more than females, as families can only have one child, which invariably leads to a preference of one sex over the other.	0
Church puts religious stuff into your imagination. It's the same reason that kids who watch Superman think they can fly.. Church is simply an institution for worship.

"Such a non productive answer. Give me an answer or I will ban you. If I say, ""How is it that I can be 10 feet tall,"" the answer is that I'm not 10 feet tall, right?

i don't agree with you, I've got a lot of friends who are girls, and we're all good friends. i don't think that if you communicate with one girl close, it means that you love her.	of course.i have a lot of friends who are boys. and that's OK, we're really true friends. but, I'm talking about the woman and man who are together for example for 3 or 5 years, and can you say that they're just friends? i don't think so. this type of relationship late or early Will ended up with marriage in my opinion, and i think that's fine.	0
"HAHA I wish these guys could just die of every fucking disease, Republicans don't give a shit about minorities If you were alive many years ago, you probably would have supported the Republicans. Up until 1964, Democrats were viewed as the ""Southern"" political party. Do you know which party ended slavery? The Republicans. The Democrats supported slavery. The KKK was actually created by a group of Democrats. Times have obviously changed, but the fact of the matter is that the Democratic party, as well as the USA, would be very different if they had gotten their way regarding the abolishment of slavery. In a sense, the Democratic party that you (I assume that's who you support) and many others support, was created by the Republicans. There are without a doubt, some conservative nut jobs out there... but the same goes for liberals. What it comes down to is who is the better candidate. Choosing someone because of the letter that appears next to their name is retarded. That is why we keep getting shitty presidents.  Carter(D) sucked, so we elected Reagan(R). Reagan was good, so we elected Bush(R). Bush wasn't so great, so we elected Clinton(D). Clinton was impeached after a lot of controversy, so we elected Bush(R). Bush was a mess, so we elected Obama(D). Do you see the pattern? It isn't the party that matters, it's the candidate."	First of all I was talking about the Republican party in the context of the modern conservative Republican party but lets remove party descriptions and replace it with ideological descriptions I am a progressive first and a democrat second don't forget that! Lincoln was a progressive he may have been a Republican but he still had a liberal agenda and so on. Anyway I should end my point by explaining my opinions on the presidents listed. Nixon was good until Watergate happened then he was impeached. Gerald Ford took office for the the following 2 years nobody fucking liked him! Carter got elected in 76 he was cool because he was the first non interventionist president since like 1913 but he got a lot of shit for the Iranian issue despite the fact that freeing them was in carters negotiations. Reagan may have been perceived as a good president but in all reality he was one of our shittiest presidents he started the trickle down economics movement, cutting taxes on the rich and de regulating corporations which set the stage for the shit we are in today. HW Bush was no better except Americans were less excited about him than Reagan Bush started the first war in Iraq setting the stage for our modern foreign policy a bit, and the minute Americans realized the hypocrisy on his tax position they immediately elected Clinton. Clinton never was impeached but he got a lot of shit for the Monica Lewinsky controversy still being mocked about it to this day but Clinton was a brilliant President regardless. W Bush was elected as a result of the impatience of Floridian Republicans, the Republican national committee contacted federal court to stop all recounts, when failing to do so they went to the supreme court and they did it successfully and announced Bush the winner a year later a study confirmed that had the recounts in Florida resumed Al Gore would have won the election so Bushes election was entirely an accident not a result of Clinton's controversy. Bush was terrible so we elected Obama, Obama was a disappointment but not as terrible as people make him out to be also I think we are probably going to elect Clinton 2 so maybe it is not a pattern!	0
"Things like racism and patriotism hold humanity from from being more then mere territorial animals. If we want to progress in evolution beyond the common beast, we have to, over time, become less hateful and competitive and be more cooperative. There will always be enough resources in the universe for all life to share. War and murder and competition solves nothing unless you are a beast. I can see where you get the idea that patriotism and racism can be a good thing for warriors during war... but frankly, war is pointless, idiotic, and barbaric. Innocent people are killed and raped. What is the point? Genuine human evil does exist... but killing more innocent people to stop it does not accomplish anything. And even if war is somehow necessary in the eyes of the genuinely good, something, at the very least, needs to be done in all world culture that will, over time, eventually stop people from becoming evil in the first place. ""Is doesn't matter what you think or do or believe; as soon as you enter a battle, you will always be in the wrong."" - Quote by, Kyoraku Shunsui. Perhaps... it is a fairy tale to believe that humanity will one day be free of malice and vice and selfishness... but I do not believe that evolution has a limit that will stop it from happening one day... one day that is an incalculably long time away from today."	I don't agree with the violence of war. However, i believe war do have a point. It is like a violent protest in such a way. We don't go into war without reason. Well, i don't have knowledge about the past wars but today wars are started to protect America. Well, that is what i believe.  I understand your comment. However, what if war was unavoidable? That your opponents are barbaric enough not to reason. Is racism plus patriotism THEN a good thing? in your opinion.  I would say yes if and only if, the person was smart enough to manipulate his emotion to give him or herself confidence. Tho i wouldn't suggest it to people who would eventually carry on through the rest of their lives. upvote. The reason is mainly because i agree with most of your argument. Tho giving someone an upvote is pointless because it is basically implying that i agree with you totally. I don't completely because, like i said, i do think war has a reason. I just thought i should give you a reason for giving you an upvote. :)	0
No one can take the Bible word for word, it is full of metaphors. Are you too stupid to comprehend this?	I'm sorry but how can you metaphorically interpret Numbers 15: 32-36 15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. Please tell me how the pathetic excuse of a metaphor applies here.	0

Literature can be very interesting, but can it save lives? Well, I suppose it can, but only a few lives...

No, I'm telling you the President gets too much blame, along with too credit. The President does not have the power to declare war, so how can you blame President Bush for going to war?

If there are exceptions you cannot make it a universal rule. I don't think I'm missing the point, because the fact is that there are some bad parents out there. I thought this debate was about whether or not children should look after their elderly parents. If this debate is about whether or not some children should look after their elderly parents if they were really good parents (which is subjective), I would still disagree. All parents do have a choice in having a child. Even if they accidentally get pregnant, they can choose to give up their child for adoption to parents who want them. They do make the choice to have and raise children, unless someone is holding a gun to their head. I don't want to have children. However if I did, I would want to be the best parent possible because children can't choose who their parents are. If I had kids I would want to have a great relationship with them, so I would try my hardest to be a loving and positive influence in their lives. If they chose not to see me when I was old, I would not resent them for it. I would not expect them to take care of me just because I gave birth to them. I would wonder what it was I did wrong, that they didn't want to see me.	So you would never take your parent to the doctor if they were old and couldn't walk? You would never take them out for a meal if hey were lonely?  I would hate to have you as a child.	0
"free will is just an excuse for a nonexistent god's inability to intervene This is written in a manner which leads me to believe that you do not believe in the existence of free will. ppl That's ""people"". Use the real word if you're going to be using this site; last thing we need is for uneducated corruptors and saboteurs of the English language to destroy the respectability of this site. We're not Facebook; we are not for the immature to ramble in abbreviations and blasphemous misspellings! If God hardened Pharaoh's heart, then he violated free will and punished the children of Egypt for his own gratification. Why couldn't God violate an individual's free will to make a point?"	'This is written in a manner which leads me to believe that you do not believe in the existence of free will.' so it never occurred to you that i don't believe in any god? 'free will' in the theological sense is an excuse. that's not to say that ppl cant do whatever the hell they want to do. but our ability to make decisions doesn't have anything to do with a 'god allowing us' to do so, or 'not wanting us to be robots.'  'Why couldn't God violate an individual's free will to make a point?' because that is logically inconsistent with the assertion that god cannot (or does not) violate free will. if god could violate Pharaoh's free will to give himself an excuse to kill all Egypt's first born, he could violate the 'free will' of all child molesters to make sure no child was ever again molested. and in doing so, he would be beginning to solve 'the problem of evil'. 'the problem of evil' is only a problem because theists contended that god is all powerful, all knowing, and all loving. these qualities are directly contradicted by the persistence of 'evil'. one cannot be all loving, all powerful and indifferent to the suffering of untold millions of children.  the fact that i need to explain all this, puts a particularly humorous spin on your totally unnecessary snipe, citing 'uneducated corruptors'. but thanks for asking.	0
I think it's a given that the ones that you consider to be metaphorical, in your opinion, are using metaphor. Additionally, I'm not really concerned with what parts of the Bible you've decided are metaphorical either. I'll ask a third time; what is your methodology for distinguishing between what is metaphorical in the Bible and what is not?	Things that don't make sense, excluding the miracles, are mostly metaphorical. Anything that isn't human dialogue may be metaphorical. Dialogue isn't.	0
You're responding to an argument about Jesus advocating the abandonment and murder of children, as well as not only keeping slaves, but beating them, so forgive me for not seeing your point. I haven't forgotten you making the same misguided argument in another debate. Could you please clarify your position? Again, as out of place as it may be, it seems to me your argument is, stop bringing up the fact that God is a blood thirsty lunatic because that's the Old Testament.	No, that's not my argument at all. My argument is this: You are criticizing the wrong religion. Judaism is the religion of the Old Testament, though I don't really expect you to get that through your thick skull.	0

"Not at all 1. Sales of video games have more than quadrupled from 1995-2008, while the arrest rate for juvenile murders fell 71.9% and the arrest rate for all juvenile violent crimes declined 49.3% in this same period. (1) 2. Violent Kids are attracted towards violent video games not Violence in the Video Games in my opinion. 3. A Casual Link between violence and violent video games has NOT been proven 4. In 2005, the US had 2,279 murders committed by teenagers (27.9 per million residents) compared to 73 in Japan (3.1 per million). Per capita video game sales were $5.20 in the US compared to $47 in Japan. (2) (3) (4) 5. Claims like these have been blamed since radio, movies, and television have been introduced. It did not increase violence.

It seems your saying that videos games are reducing crimes while in fact, its probation and classes that reduce crime.  2.) Irregardless of your bias statement, that is critically not true. Gossip can easily influence a average kid to look into violent video games. 3.) False. In fact, there has been many studies into adolescents obtaining increased agression after playing violent video games and ""gruesome"" films. [1] Steinfeld, J. (1972). Statement in hearings before Subcommittee on Communications of Committee on Commerce (United States Senate, Serial #92-52, pp. 25-27). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.

Like my first rebuttal. I don't see why this has much support in your contention.  5.) Again a false claim. Here are some studies that disprove your claim. <a href='http://www.research.vt.edu/resmag/sciencecol/media_violence.html'>http://www.research.vt.edu/resmag/sciencecol/media_violence.html  *Your forgetting a keyword in the question. That is ""effect."" Thus, the situation I argue doesn't mean video games and films must be ""violent"" but do they have a effect on kids. Many video games and movies are made to tap into people's emotions. Some video games are meant to give a soothing mood to the player while others are meant to anger people."	0

"THAT IS BULLSHIT. Stop with that ""God's will"" bullshit. Thats a sham, an excuse, a lie. A way christians weasle around their MANY unanswered prayers and make excuses for their nonexistent god not doing a DAMN THING. Its not an excuse God holds your life and mine at the palm of His hands and He can take me at any moment in my life if its truly God's will which its not at the moment because I still probably have lots of years to go but that can all change because God know my future and my plans for me.  Now its great that you think shes up in the clouds happy with your sky daddy in peace, thats all fine and dandy and warm and fuzzy. But think, what if she didnt believe in god? or what if she lied, or stole? I know that if thats the case then you think she went to hell AND DESERVES it. How do you know she isnt there?? Not so happy to think about now is it? Thats what you make people feel when you say their friends and family could potentially burn in hell. Isnt that sickening to you? To think your grandmother right now is being tormented? It sickens everyone else you voice it to.. Keep that in mind the next time your about to judge someone My grandma was a Christian all of her life and she was a very godly women who obeyed God. Why would God send her to hell when she had great faith in God? That would be just wrong if God did that. I am sure that she is in Heaven right now because she followed Jesus Christ.  Also that is another excuse that atheists say you say all of theses excuses like but if she didn't believe in God and all of that other excuses. I SAW and witnesses my grandma and she was a Christian. You don't know her so why do you make the assumption that what if she didn't believe in God? That's so SILLY!  I don't judge people."	"How in the hell do you KNOW? neither I nor you nor the pope nor the smartest scientist KNOWS the truth behind the world, god, the universe ect.  No, you have many years ahead because that is average human life expectancy. Add good health and no illness or accident and there you go, 70+ years of life. And if that does end it's by chance. Why would god have to rely on natural processes to carry out his supernatural will? He made the earth and universe and man by a whim without any process needed. So why does he need cancer, or leukemia, or accidental falls to ""take"" people away? If it's his will why aren't there more deaths with no detectable causes? I never said I knew your grandmother. I never said anything I preposed was truth. It was hypothetical. Now I ask again, what IF you by chance did not know your grandma was hypothetically a secret atheist? Or broke a commandment? Then hypothetically, shed be in hell and itd be justified by your standards. I'm saying that is what's fucked up"	0

You can't be your own kind of Christian. You ether choose God's path and His rules or no path at all and be like everyone else. You can't change God's rules its there and it will stay there for eternity.	"For being a supposedly all-powerful being the one thing god seems to be unable to do is clearly and explicitly state his will to humanity. If we can agree nobody should take just the word of a self-appointed intermediary (clergy) on what god wants for you, then really your only source is the Bible. Well, if you give five different individuals each a Bible and send them into separate rooms to read the text and then tell you what they thought god wanted for humanity you would get some very different answers. There would be similarities, of course, but huge swaths of scripture are vague, ambiguous, or are contradicted by other verses in the Bible with no suggestion as to which verse should be followed and which should be ignored, so people are inevitably bound to arrive at different conclusions. For example there is a specific command to kill shortly after a general command not to kill. In these instances individuals must rely on their personal interpretation of scripture; there is no universally accepted explanation of what the Bible is or what it is trying to say.  You think you've got it right; of course you do. But so does every other Christian on the planet, and they all believe something slightly (or greatly) different than you do about their faith. Your interpretation of gods word is not the interpretation; it's your interpretation, and accordingly your idea of ""gods path,"" for example, is really nothing more than your subjective opinion based on your open-to-debate interpretation of vague, ambiguous, and contradictory texts influenced by the opinions of religious ""professionals."" In other words we can't be even remotely sure that your idea of what ""gods path"" is is actually ""gods path."" For all you know Ismalia's got is right and you've got it all wrong; all that the two of you have is your subjective opinion based on your personal interpretation, and your opinion isn't intrinsically more valid than hers just because it's yours."	0
If I understand Szechuan's argument correctly, then it's not a question of whether we should have an army or not, but rather 'should we have an offensive army or not'. Mind you, the Swede's do have an army -- it's just not a standing army, it's a militia. And a conscripted one at that. I fully support the notion of a conscripted militia. There are few more powerful defenses than to have an nearly entire nation's males trained to fight war. And the affect of conscription does great things for national pride as well as endowing individuals with useful skills (navigation, self-defense, leadership). Having said that, we're in no position to abolish the army now. It will be several decades before we could work ourselves into a position diplomatically that would allow us to remove troops and support from around the world.	Just wanted to say I think that was a very well thought out and worded argument. I agree that now is not the time at all to abolish the Army. Although some people hate to admit it the fear of the US Military is what keeps most nations peaceful in the world. You think North Korea or Iran wouldn't have attacked one of its neighbors by now if it weren't for the US Military?	0

First of all I want to tell you that I get what you are saying. I truly do but it seems to me like what you are dong is trying to make freedom of religion and freedom from religion be the same thing and to me at least they seem to be entirely different things. To go back to your soda analogy freedom of soda would be like having a refrigerator filled with every kind of soda and you could pick any one you want. Whereas freedom from soda would mean you could chose to have some beverage other than soda. See how the two are different?	" First of all I want to tell you that I get what you are saying. I truly do but it seems to me like what you are doing is trying to make freedom of religion and freedom from religion be the same thing and to me at least they seem to be entirely different things. In a way they are, freedom of religion sounds like total freedom revolving around religion to me. That means the freedom to be religious or the freedom to not be religious, and the freedom to have any religion. Otherwise it is not freedom of religion, it is more specifically freedom to choose which religion you are. I do think you understand what I am saying but choosing to not really acknowledge the logic behind my argument. We are talking about the freedom of religion, the ability to make any personal choice about religion, not just the freedom to choose religion as that is more specific than freedom of religion, but the freedom to have or to not have, and to choose your religion, etcetera.   To go back to your soda analogy freedom of soda would be like having a refrigerator filled with every kind of soda and you could pick any one you want. Whereas freedom from soda would mean you could chose to have some beverage other than soda. See how the two are different? No because that is a horrible analogy... The freedom from soda wouldn't necessarily mean the freedom to choose another beverage, that would be ""the freedom of beverage"", ""freedom from soda"" would mean the freedom to decline a soda which would be contained within the ""freedom of soda"", but not necessarily in the ""freedom of choice of soda"". I honestly feel like you are trying to willfully ignore the point I am making. No offense. That could just be me."	0

I do agree that the Army should be reduced and more reserved should be readied. In a sense, they reserves are what Jefferson is talking about.

Teachers, how did those teachers learn, and so on branching to the first human that existed when knowledge wasn't in existance. Just because it's said doesn't mean it's truth. How are we to know.	"The knowledge I have, that I exist, is absolute and certain. No one needed to teach me this. Yet I am pretty sure you would call this intrinsic self knowledge ""man made"" as well. Now according to the logic you would have me accept, it is due to the ""man made"" nature of knowledge that I cannot know for certain that I exist. I'm sorry but that is as poorly justified a logical statement as..""I ate Ice Cream last Thursday so I can't know anything for certain."" ie IT DOES NOT LOGICALLY FOLLOW BTW where the hell did you get the idea that knowledge wasn't in existence when your imaginary ""first human"" was kicking about? Just because you can be certain about something that isn't the case, doesn't mean that you can't also be certain about something that IS the case (IE have true knowledge about something)"	0

Grade 8's can be 14, does some Grade 8 sound responsible to you? There is no need for someone just entering puberty to own and drive a car. and if i chose to have a baby at this age ; i would be ready to be a mother but like i said in my other debate i got other tjhings to worry about When did I talk about you having a baby, I don't remember this.

If you drink another persons blood, are you not feeding off of that person? Feeding off of your own kind is cannibalism. Vampirism, if taken only as bloodsucking or blood drinking, if directed toward your own kind, is cannibalism. Powdered meat mixed with blood and drank is not eating it, it is drinking it. You are drinking your own kind, not eating, according to you that is not cannibalism.	Ok let me rephrase injesting (that could be eating or drinking) the Flesh of your own kind is cannibabilism, drinking blood that could be from your own species or any other species is vapirism it's really that simple	0

It's quite interesting topic, coz, I can compare the education system in my country to in other countries.  In my country, there is no dropout until high school only if students deliberately don't quit their school. So, in my point of view, it is unfair to make students stay with the same level. Because, individuals have different favours for subjects. I saw some students studied hard and got good scores from the middle of high school.  If they had got dropout, they might've felt frustrated and shameful and quit their school.  I don't think that is the right path for students to get to next level.  Therefore, there should be extra classes for students who behind their companies after school to catch up.  We don't need to make students losers early, but need to give them right guideline to follow regular curriculum.	When I was in High School it became a hell because they would overstock you with homework that burned up all your time, and there was continual stress of getting good grades. I wound up quitting my homework and just acing the tests and finals, I needed the free time to unwind from the pressure I was under. Quitting high school was great because it freed up time so that I could study the subjects that interested me. If I stayed I would have failed it because I couldn't take that regiment any longer.	0

HA! So I'm sure before Christianity everyone just killed everyone and had a great time of it! No. I was born with morals, just like everyone else. I don't get my morals from religion. I don't need religion to tell me what's right and what's wrong in life. You get a three year old and give it a hamster. That three year old has never heard of God or Jesus before, yet it knows that killing the hamster is bad. You can rant on about your religions to me you're not going to convince me. I know, for a fact, I did not get my morals from religion. I am an atheist, and I have had morals since the day I was born, and I will have them until the day I die.	"Let me first make clear that I am not religious. I consider myself to be an Agnostic. I do not know if God exists, you don't either. So I am not ranting on about MY religions, as you put it. Now let me make this clear, what you have just said to me is complete and utter bullshit. You do not understand what you are talking about. You are not born with morals. You gain your morals as you grow. HA! So I'm sure before Christianity everyone just killed everyone and had a great time of it!  Do you think Christianity was the first religion? Christianity came after Christ. You are aware of Judaism, Hinduism, Paganism, and Greek Mythology... right? These are the world's first religions (the most well known from before Christianity). Now I don't know very much about Paganism, but I do know that these religions all taught important morals for the followers to live their lives by. It is also a well known fact that the world was a much more violent place back then. Maybe they didn't have a ""great time"" killing others, but they had many stonings and public executions, as well as many wars.  I don't need religion to tell me what's right and what's wrong in life. Open your eyes man, it already has! Maybe your parents are athiest, but are your grandparents? If they are, then were their parents? The list could go on, but at some point in your bloodline is a follower of a certain religion. Take the middle ages for example. That time period was governed by the church in Europe. They did not believe in science, only in what the Bible said. We obviously live more healthy, productive lives now, but the morals were still passed down. The Bible, or any religious text, don't necessarily guide all of your choices, but they do for most of the moral choices. The ten commandments probably guide a lot of how you live. Adultery is a good example. You see that as wrong, don't you? But why? Or lying... Do you find that to be immoral? Read the Ten Commandments. You will find that you live your life by most, if not all of them. You get a three year old and give it a hamster. That three year old has never heard of God or Jesus before, yet it knows that killing the hamster is bad. The three year old doesn't kill the hamster, because he/she was taught that killing is wrong by her parent(s)/guardian(s). You can rant on about your religions to me you're not going to convince me. Like I said before, they are not MY religions. I am not religious. Considering the fact that you are an athiest, you obviously base your beliefs on facts. Well it is a FACT that our morals are based off religions.  I know, for a fact, I did not get my morals from religion. I am an atheist, and I have had morals since the day I was born, and I will have them until the day I die. If you know this for a fact, why don't you prove it to me? This is your chance to blow the lid off the whole ""morals came from religions"" debate we are having here. How could you have been born with morals? Is it your soul that came pre-programmed with morals? Well that sounds kind of like something a religious person would say... Kind of a strange argument for an athiest."	0

In this instance it wasn't just taking a punch in a fistfight, though, it was the gruesome deaths of thousands of Americans in a surprise bombing run.

"I would have to say home school because then children aren't exposed to the bad behavior I've dealt with in school and it would be specialized. Education isn't simply an academic process. Its pedagogy entails the proper raising of ""good citizens"" - in whatever manner that is defined. That education requires that people aren't raised to be naive: that they encountered wonders and villainy, have screwed up, and simply done all the correspondingly stupid nonsense that we normally associate with youth while they're actually young, can be protected and guided as properly as possible, inasmuch as anyone can. And having screwed up,and done all the correspondingly stupid things that we normally associate with youth, they can grow up. But growing requires those kinds of experiences: digesting and ultimately surmounting them. Keeping children away from ""bad behavior"" often does leave them unprepared for an adulthood that will see them absolutely inundated with that kind of behavior at almost every turn. There's a reason why little girls who are overprotected by their fathers often end up becoming whores. They don't know how to appropriately deal with the stimuli that life presents. And when they finally encounter it, they get turned out. And I don't want the bad teachers that can't keep their opinions to themselves to brainwash any child. When one is educated, one tends to have opinions on things. But, to suggest that you just want your children to learn facts would ultimately undermine them. For example, Robert Francoise Damien was executed for trying to assassinate the King of France. That's a fact. But that fact alone tells your child nothing about why the death of Damien represents a contradiction of the Enlightenment. It also doesn't educate your child as to why the contradictions of the Enlightenment are an important lesson to learn. And your child will be ill-served, because many of those contradictions are present in modern society, and we need people who are able to analyze issues contextually so as to solve them. Your child would be less able to provide adequate solutions to human problems because all they got was a bunch of dates, names of people and other irrelevant stuff in school. On a tangential point: all education is brainwashing or indoctrination. There is no difference. We educators give students information and punish them in various ways for not accepting that information. Having been punished academically, many of those students will then go on to be ostracized by society as whole. So, we make sure that they know everything we want them to know in the service of our needs. And we make damn certain that they think everything else is morally and intellectually wrong. A well educated person is simply someone who has been increasingly brainwashed over time, and in fewer, more concentrated subjects."	"An excellent post overall. I was, in fact, the product of an overly-cautious secondary education system that avoided discussing any topic that had the slightest possibility of controversy, and hence we ended up naming things and reciting chronologies more than anything :P I don't quite agree with the final point though. Education at primary/secondary school often does consist of pure information-feeding with little room for dissent, a very unfortunate phenomenon. But the further you go up the academic ladder, the more wriggle room you have - the more you are not only allowed, but encouraged, to have unusual opinions. Education at the higher levels involves an opening up of narrow minds: the questioning of ideas that you took for granted, or ideas that you didn't even know existed, is the prerequisite to finding answers to such questions. If you voice opinions contrary to mainstream beliefs, naturally you would encounter significant opposition. But this doesn't show that educated people stifle dissent; rather, it shows that the process of academic debate is working. If they didn't oppose your opinions, how would they test whether your theory is defensible, and how would you get the chance to refine it? Of course, even the most educated people are prone to human errors like bias, favouritism, and stubbornness - sometimes they go beyond academic opposition and into personal enmity. If you propose a theory that opposes someone else's, don't be surprised if they don't like you anymore. If you propose a theory that opposes most other people's theories, don't be surprised if most people don't like you anymore. But this sort of behaviour is hardly an ideal of higher education; it's a fault and rightly recognised as such. In other cases, apparent restrictions on academic freedom are not put into place by the academic community, but by government policy or public opinion. Take, for example, a piece of headline news from a few years back: A PhD student wrote a thesis on the Holocaust arguing that there were significantly fewer Jewish victims than conventional historians believe. He was awarded his doctorate, and kept it for years until the media uncovered this incident and stirred up tremendous public backlash, and the university had to rescind the degree. Notably, it was the general public - i.e. the generally less educated group - that reacted in favour of curtailing academic freedom. (Note that I'm not arguing in favour of Holocaust revisionism - I'm only raising this as a high-profile example.) Heh, the very fact that I saw the need to include such a disclaimer shows how much pressure there is to conform, and be clearly seen to conform, to certain accepted statements like ""6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust"". But the pressure largely comes not from the highest educational echelon of society - while individual academics may feel strongly about this issue, academia in general doesn't pump out tract after tract of denunciations of the Holocaust. It is the popular media and the general public that repeat the ritual phrases ""Holocaust denial"", ""offensive"", ""neo-Nazi"", or ""racist"", and then these opinions seep into law when politicians seek to ingratiate the voters. In a university classroom, sitting among a dozen postgraduate history students, I wouldn't need to make a disclaimer; it'd be taken for granted that I'm making no comment about it, and that even if I were, it would be a comment that I could back up with sound argument. But in a public forum frequented by people of varying educational backgrounds I cannot assume this. Educated people, in general, cherish the freedom to argue for any position they like as long as their argument is rational and supported by evidence. The curtailment of this freedom is usually caused by a lack of education: either a loss of rationality on the part of an individual who is so passionate about his theory that he cannot accept opposition, or the submission of the highly educated to the less educated when public opinion prevails."	0

In the video that you gave, you've said that using tap water and reusable bottles is significantly better for the environment, but, the problem is.. what if you do not have a reliable water source and instead of helping yourself, you get amobeiasis or other kinds of disease with it.

Because, using bottles is also detrimental in our environment, and in our body. Plastic chemicals are bad for us.	I'm not against using bottled water completely.

I am well aware that obscenity is not protected under the 1St Amendment due to the court ruling, but I have an issue with any law that has a ruling based on a judgment that requires subjective opinion. The test that the FCC uses, the Miller Test, is this:   1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,  2.Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law,  3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. (This is also known as the (S)LAPS test- [Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific.) The work is considered obscene only if all three conditions are satisfied. Requirement number three is the one I have the biggest issue with. To say something is artistic is completely subjective. The same could be said for political.  There are cases where it is clearly a political issue, but what about times where symbolism or allegory are being used? For example, if a person were to run an ad displaying people dying in a hospital to demonstrate that we need health care reform would that fall under political? I would say yes, but someone else might disagree and we would run into an issue over which side is right.	And when it comes to a dispute on an issue that is where voting comes into play... whatever the majority sees as the standard can be used as the community standard.  Plus I don't see how that example of a person dying in a hospital bed works because it fails to meet the first 2 conditions which means whether or not it meets the 3rd condition a moot point.	0

So long as Kyptonite doesn't come into play, I have to favor Superman overall. I expect neither would be able to do much of anything in the way of damage to one another, but such a struggle would inevitably take a toll on the venue. Of the two, Superman is able to survive in the vaccuum of space, and Goku is not. In the event of the destruction of the planet in question, Goku would essentially be forced to flee, leaving superman the winner by default. If Kryptonite were to enter the picture, Goku would certainly win, but using that would be rather out of character for Goku. But either of these characters fighting the other would be equally out of character, so I suppose it should be considered.	Goku would essentially be forced to flee, leaving superman the winner by default. I don't see how that concludes that superman would win. Where's the contest? If anything that would only be a draw.	0

"Prove what to you?! That you did not get most of your morals from religion. Somewhere in your bloodline is religious followers who passed down their morals. Maybe you think you received your morals from society... well where do you think their morals came from?  You give me some solid proof that it DOES!  How about a college education on the subject? How about the fact that I have brought my studies on the topic beyond college? You do understand that I am not arguing that religions are correct, don't you? I am trying to get you to realize that although you are an athiest, your life has been greatly influenced by religions.  the proof I have is that, basically, there is no religion to have given me morals. That isn't proof. Although you are an athiest, it wouldn't hurt you to learn more about the world you live in and study some religions. You don't even understand what you oppose. Buddhism is a good example, I left you an argument a few days ago on the topic of whether or not Buddhism is a religion. I did this because your original response was so far from the truth, that I just could not ignore it. And trust me, there is much more solid proof showing religion doesn't exist as appose to a bunch of brainwashed morons who believe on walking and water and all that crap! There is ""solid proof"" showing that RELIGION does not exist? Well damn, I'd like to see that! The argument you are referring to is whether or not GOD exists, not religion. We don't know if he exists or not. I don't care how many Big Bang Theories you have heard, that still does not mean that a higher being does not exist. Same goes for Christians or any other religion, they can preach all they want but it does not convince me that what they say is correct. That is why I am in the middle, an agnostic, just as everyone should be. Does God exist? I don't fucking know! That's not what this debate is about. I'm telling you that your life has been greatly influenced by religion. Do you celebrate Christmas? That is a Christian holiday. Maybe you just put up a christmas tree... Well that was a pagan tradition. How about marriage... Your parents are/were married, correct? You plan on getting married right? Well you can thank religion for that. The wedding ring tradition dates back to Paganism as well. For adultery to be commited, one must be married, correct? So if marriage is a religious tradition and adultery is seen as immoral, wouldn't that mean that this view stems directly from religion? This is just one example. Can you still honestly deny that religion has not affected your life and some of your views?"	 Somewhere in your bloodline is religious followers who passed down their morals. And where did those morals come from? And so on and on. But this is no ad infinitum. The social contract is the reducible starting point of morality. But whereas morality presupposes philosophy, religion does not presuppose morality. The belief in a higher being and institutionalizing a series of procedure or criterion relating to that belief don't automatically dictate any moral code. Religions are tools of mental coercion, adopting whatever tools its creators deem necessary to fulfill their ends(whether they be noble in nature or not). Maybe you think you received your morals from society... well where do you think their morals came from? My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists—and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values imply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride.  Ayn Rand I am trying to get you to realize that although you are an athiest, your life has been greatly influenced by religions.  Influenced yes. Dictated morally? Not at all.   For adultery to be commited, one must be married, correct? So if marriage is a religious tradition and adultery is seen as immoral, wouldn't that mean that this view stems directly from religion? No. Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). Given the territorial nature of primitive creatures, I don't doubt that the conclusion that a mate should be exclusive to oneself predates religion by quite a considerable degree.	0
Oh no I agree no one should be put through a bad life I think people should have the right to take their own life, that's why I'm for assisted death because I think people should be given the choice cowardly or not. I only say it can be seen as cowardly because it's the easy way out, that is the only reason.	"Do you seriously consider suicide to be an easy action?

Lying is part of the game. Everyone agrees lying is a part of the game. Since we created the rules of the game, we decide what is right and wrong in it.

Omniscience means knowing everything, rather than knowing everything that's known. While knowing everything (even from a group setting) is nigh on impossible, it's entirely possible to know everything that's currently known (the sum of knowledge of a group). With the advance of supercomputers, and hard drives, it's becoming all the more realistic.	Thank you :) I suppose that If there is a finite number of things, everything can be known. On the other hand if things are infinite than it's impossible to know All because all logically entails a finite class of things.	0
Assuming a person is aware that the punishment of society for cold-blooded murder is to die then the person who commits the crime condemns themselves. They chose to die in order to murder. It is then merely a matter of following through on their choice; they killed themselves.	That's not how the world works. If I tell you that if you punch me, I'll kill you, and then you punch me, and I kill you, you have not killed yourself: I have killed you. There is no middle ground simply because it is the actions of a government.	0
An evolved specie wouldn't do things simply because it can. If man can create atom bombs and destroy cities and kill people, it doesn't mean he should.  The argument that 'it carries out an act of greed is because it can carry out an act of greed' isn't a valid argument in the context which is created here: an evolved specie. Refer to the definition of 'evolve' I gave you somewhere else.  Mankind, if calls itself evolved, developed, superior and more intelligent than other specie on earth, bears a moral responsibility to not indulge in acts of greed and harm other creations. That's my point.	An evolved specie wouldn't do things simply because it can.  I don't mean that the reason we do anything is because we can, I mean that the cause is because we can. For example, I don't go to Disneyland for the reason that I can, but I can if I choose, because I can. Slightly confusing, but I wasn't sure how else to word it. If man can create atom bombs and destroy cities and kill people, it doesn't mean he should. Is-Ought distinction. Again, I'm not saying we should do it for the reason that we can, just that we can because we are able to. Mankind, if calls itself evolved, developed, superior and more intelligent than other specie on earth, bears a moral responsibility to not indulge in acts of greed and harm other creations. That's my point.  I had an inkling, but I didn't want to straw man you. This raises a question then. Do you believe in objective morality?	0
-Duly noted.- You wouldn't happen to be a jackass would you? My thought process is not flawed, it just did not contain any good sources of information and was a reply to your question off the top of my head. I can get more in depth if you want... You mentioned those who are diligent workers, what about those who are not?  Speeding up the process is usually not a good thing when it comes to schooling, at least from my experience. My main problem with any online course is that students may find themselves unable to resist the answers to the times test sitting their on their computer behind another tab, or even their friend who happened to pass the course in a class room. I also find problems with never actually seeing your teacher, though you may see him/her once in a blue moon that does not lead to a healthy relationship between a student in need of help a good percentage of the time with a professor who is drinking whiskey at his house.	You wouldn't happen to be a jackass would you? No, just your average high school student. My thought process is not flawed, it just did not contain any good sources of information and was a reply to your question off the top of my head. Well I would like to hear this good information. I can get more in depth if you want... After you sir. Speeding up the process is usually not a good thing when it comes to schooling, at least from my experience. Well that is an interesting claim. However anyone from the medical field must pass all tests in order to become anything in the medical field. These tests include ones where a professor is present and evaluating ( the important tests ), so if a student happened to cheat on all of his/her tests taken within the comfort of their home will more than likely fall into the less than 1/8th percentage of students who drop out or fail online courses. Procrastination to the point of failure is a sign of one who is weak of mind.	0
Basically. That IS what you advocate. I have never advocated big business, that is your perceptive. Big businesses form naturally from an unregulated market and unregulated business practices.  Big business forms due to demand. Business operates as a voluntarily exchange between two parties of good and services. McDonalds or Ford has every forced me into a exchange of their goods or services. They grew out of the demand by consumers and lack of multiple competitors. The entity that forces into service is the government, and if I don't pay for their services, I go to jail. They secure their assets by buying political favours. it is a natural consequence of free market and lack of regulations that increasing regulations will emerge as businesses start to play politics for their favour. Wrong, that is consequence of big business and big government working in collusion.	I have never advocated big business, that is your perceptive. You advocate practices which lead to big business and fight policies that would be against their interests. Big business forms due to demand.

They grew out of the demand by consumers and lack of multiple competitors. The entity that forces into service is the government, and if I don't pay for their services, I go to jail. Why do you think big businesses have few or no competitors? They lobby (buy political favour) so that competition cannot exist. They become bigger because of this entanglement with government. Wrong, that is consequence of big business and big government working in collusion. No, government has no incentive to help businesses for personal gain. What happens is that big (or growing) businesses offer money to political campaigns, and endorse politicians, in addition to other tactics. A perfect example are the big Intellectual Property owners. The internet is a form of competition to their business model. It's a disruptive technology. What do these owners do? They buy favours from their governments so that now police inspect our hardware for stored songs and videos, and now people who copy songs and movies face lawsuits, and are especially vulnerable as these companies lobby for greater legal tools to acquire the personal habits of people they intend to sue. It doesn't end there, because technologies that can bypass digital restrictions are being made illegal, all for the sake of protecting the interests of these big companies. The government would probably rather keep its nose out of this, but thanks to these extremely wealthy companies, and their lobbying, digital downloads are being treated like drug trafficking. The government didn't step in early on and choose to make these companies bigger with regulations. It was at these companies' behests.	0

no the call gave USA a late game equalizer that forced an extra time situation.

I would definitely agree with that.

We like USA and got steer this game in their favor."" And I just don't buy that. Could the outcome been different and those calls weren't made? Absolutely!

"Iron man is reckless and would not make a good president. Whereas batman has a strong sense of patriotism, has strong moral principles, and understands the economy. He is also very cultural, and clearly the smarter of the two. Moreover, he is very diplomatic and has a small ego, which is important when serving a country and not yourself.

One of our best hopes for the eventual realization of the brotherhood of man.""  Batman: ""Better put 5 cents in the meter."" Robin: ""No policeman's going to give the Batmobile a ticket.""

I argue that prejudice-free society is impossible. I agree. The best we can do is to have prejudice free laws. And if I desire statelessness? Then do not become a citizen, or renounce your citizenship. I did not call for people to be forced into citizenship, only for people to adhere to the rules they swear to follow.  I certainly would not be granted it.  Being granted statelessness is an oxymoron. Just take it. But do not expect the Canadian government to like it when you just claim their land for your anarchist demesne.  I was born here and as such must follow all of Canada's laws. If you don't like Canada's laws, leave Canada. If I, along with a large group of people, attempted to form my own society comparable to the Gypsies or Amish, I would not be allowed. Taking land from a country is an act of war.   I would still be under Canada's laws. I would be forced to conform to Canada's way of thinking. If you want to live in Canada then you have to follow the laws that the majority of Canadians (in theory) believe to be just. The government ought not even have the power to make such laws. Humans always gravitate towards government.  It is an intrusion into personal privacy. Without law you have no right to privacy. Then why force them to be? I do not represent the U.S government. I am merely saying what I believe should be the case, not what is. Should not the law - at least the law in a true Democracy - reflect the feelings of the majority of citizens? That is (one of) the failing(s) of democracy - it is an illusion.	I agree. The best we can do is to have prejudice free laws. But what do the laws matter? The law can tell me not to be prejudiced, but they have no true control over my feelings - my beliefs. If you don't like Canada's laws, leave Canada. But with globalism, the world is becoming more and more compact - more unified. There is no longer any individuality. You've no choice but to conform. Take Nova Roma - they are a rather large group of people who wish to 'go back to Rome', so to speak. To return to the Roman ways. That cannot be in this society. Too many rules, too many laws. Ways have changed. That is why I prefer, if government is required, libertarianism. The government should not interfere in every aspect of life. Libertarians believe that there should be a very few laws: murder, thievery, rape - as far as I know. They shouldn't have the power to dictate night everything: what you eat, drink; how you raise your children; what you can and cannot purchase, etc., etc. Taking land from a country is an act of war.  I'm lost on this matter: where do the Amish live? America. They were born in America, do they not have citizenship? Are there exemptions to rules made specifically for the Amish? This is a completely new topic for me. . . If you want to live in Canada then you have to follow the laws that the majority of Canadians (in theory) believe to be just. But that's not how it is. In America each state elects representatives. Those representatives are supposed to act for the majority. But do they? Once they are in power, there is nothing to keep them from following their own agenda. This is the primary fault of democracy. A few years ago, Obama made a promise (broken, of course) that each and every law, before it was enacted, would be made available for everybody to read freely off the internet. If people were to have power over the making of each law, then America would truly be a democracy, in my mind. Without law you have no right to privacy. Without law I can have all the privacy I want. Without law, I can take my privacy by force, if need be. Without law, there wouldn't be - what's-the-number? 1,000,000 - security cameras all over London watching peoples' every moves. That is (one of) the failing(s) of democracy - it is an illusion. So what America has is more of a dictatorship. <a href='http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/usa_vote_facts.html?q=usa_vote_facts.html'>vote fraud gives the president power, he keeps that power via the military, or, with Obama, a <a href='http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=69601'>civilian army. All that I want is freedom. Freedom to live a life without looking behind my back every minute, being hounded by government cameras and extremely powerful government agencies.  All that I want is to live in peace - my peace, not some false sense of security given me by the government.	0

Even better! We've got creatures with intelligence and emotion but never the irrationality that plagues the human race!

You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. And they will be destroyed in time. Terrible morality. How so? You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. When a Christian, the Holy Spirit enters and gives the Christian a new nature, a nature that fights sin and death. This nature is godly and only produces good fruit. It battles our sinful nature that only produces bad fruit. We learn from our mistakes, and as Paul said in Romans 7, we hate sin, but we do it anyways. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? I am incapable of saving anyone. So, I make myself a slave to everyone, though I am not a slave to anyone, in order to win as many as possible by the grace of God being shown through my life.	I am incapable of saving anyone Then don't. You yourself said, they do deserve to be punished, and so do you. And besides, if you die you'll go to heaven, while the wicked will be punished.

Your argument is a large ""should"" argument which has no basis in present reality. An effective military is one in which there is a hierarchy of command structure, in which the subordinates obey orders unless those orders break ethics. War does have ethics, this is where the concept of war crimes comes from, for example. However, excluding these aberrations a subordinate is expected to follow orders, in order to prevent a breakdown of command structure. The military is not a democracy, it is not an intellectual forum, it isn't a device which fosters individual decision making. It is a team effort with the result being a tool for use by the state. If the military has participated in an immoral war, the state is to blame for using their military ""tool"" immorally."	0

Until the country can get itself on its feet, sickness and death will continue to be prevalent. I'm done with this pointless argument.

"I'm not a Christian but ""Merry Christmas"" is not offensive, nor is Happy Holidays. But if they are actually talking about December 25th (which took some time but people finally settled on), can't we just stick with Christmas? This is almost as bad as when they made everyone start saying ""Merry Christmas"" rather than ""Happy Saturnalia"". I mean c'mon, Can we just pick one and keep it?"	Yes it is. Wishing someone a Happy Holiday, and especially a Merry Christmas, can be offensive no matter how well intended. It is spoken form a place of religious privilege, and either in ignorance of or with disrespect for the history of oppression religion has towards the non-religious and other populations. As a queer person and an atheist I have faced legal and social discrimination my entire life because of religion.

Again, misunderstanding of Christian beliefs. God created Lucifer, who was the angel responsible for leading the worship of God in Heaven. He was a musician, un-matched. Lucifer, like all Angels, was given free-will, a mind of his own. Using that free-will, Lucifer began to be too prideful in his work and began to praise himself above God. For this, God rebuked him, but Lucifer held contempt for that and fell from Grace, taking many with him. When God created Adam and Eve, Lucifer's first idea was to screw that up. God does not make evil decisions, despite those decisions already existing. That's right, evil is NOT an aspect of the God who created the universe, but a choice, a choice that He had but never took. This is proven in scripture through the life of Jesus, who was tempted, as Adam and Eve were, in the desert during a fast. Jesus, however, refused to give in to that temptation. Jesus, being the phsycial manifestation of God, was tempted by evil- so too was God. To say that God created evil is silly. Evil is an IDEA, an idea that already existed, the same as good. Evil is a choice, not a power one bestowes upon someone, not a trait one can pass by way of creation or biology, it is a result of freed mind, a consciousness that is capable of making decisions- rational or irrational.	Yes but the point is that our free will is at fault for evil (according to you), and God is at fault for creating us, therefore god still created a being capable of choosing evil and was therefore creating the possibility for evil. According to you, God is the creator of the universe, nature, which encompasses everything in existence including evil which is an idea used to describe when an action is negative in nature of against a moral code. If God created everything, he is not exempt from being accredited with evil which is the by product of free will. You can't exclude God by placing the blame on his creation, he still created it. If God is responsible for everything in existence, the entire universe, why do you only credit him with the good? If God created everything then he is still the author of evil.	0
"Why might Korea hate us? I wonder... Maybe we brought it on ourselves... Korean war perhaps? Well we can't change the past. We have to deal with the future. We have a standing army which is spread out all throughout the world, they are not exactly able to protect the homeland from another country are they? If we had a militia which was ALWAYS in the homeland, we would be better protected/defended than we are/would be now. I am mostly talking about a homefront standing army. I am aware that our troops are everywhere, but if they were here they would be much more effective? The way to do that would be to withdraw our troops from other countries That's fine. However this debate doesn't exactly have to be centered towards America. It's any nation. I think America is just being used as a prime example because we are familiar with it. The fact that we are the ""world police"" is the reason countries hate us, the reason they might attack us, and the reason we would need to be defended. It goes had in hand with this debate and is completely relevant. Not really. The debate title I made was  Should a NATION have a standing army? I am just wondering if a nation should have one. America's world police business is for a different debate. You are right, we can't change the past. You are also right about manipulating our futures. What you do not realize is that, with a standing army, we are already beginning to repeat our mistakes, the ones that got us in to trouble in the first place. Affairs with other nations got us in trouble. The simple possession of a standing army would not spark such things. We invaded and killed. That is what got us in trouble. Simply having a standing army does not logically imply that it sparks wars because of its existence. How is it easier for war? Having troops all across the world would make it HARDER to wage war would it not? And should we even be in wars? The purpose of a militia would be defense, not war. The debate question is for a standing army. Should a nation have one or not? If a nation has all of their troops at home the populace doesn't have to fight. They can remain calm and relax and hope for the best and if things get ugly they can show offense as well. Having troops, no matter where they are, will not stop an aerial attack. For that we would need an aerial defense system, which, while owned by the government and used for purposes similar to war, A soldier has to detect it first. If a jet is coming in a soldier must alert someone and interception will begin in hopes of terminating the foreign object. We will also be ready to mobilize if there are more. A militia will not cut it. Please elaborate on this as I do not see how this is something done by a standing army that cannot be done without one. They are better trained. They are fully paid and it is a career option. Pretty much every single nation has some sort of standing army because they are far better trained for battle. Thats the point of a standing army. By the way, is this the serious debate you wanted? ;) I guess. I really didn't care. I just want to learn some new things. You seem to be smart and well educated so I can't complain."	My apologies, i thought this was centered around America. My main question then is this: What would an army do? Imagine a million or so soldiers just sitting around. What would they do? Wouldn't it be a waste to have them sitting around? They wouldn't really benefit society in times of peace. That is why an army reserve/militia is the way to go. Unless you plan on flexing your military muscles in other countries, there is no need for a standing army. A good example to look at is Switzerland.	0
"Now that I've played 'Devil's Advocate' for evolution, I shall argue against it. Too long, can't post it in an argument:  <a href='http://www.mathematicsofevolution.com/ChaptersMath/Chapter_230__Seven_Reasons__.html'>http://www.mathematicsofevolution.com/ChaptersMath/Chapter_230__Seven_Reasons__.html ========================================================== Taken from: <a href='http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm'>http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm ""The Cambrian Explosion Nearly all animal phyla made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET]) called the ""Cambrian Explosion.""[64] Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.[42] Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""[64] Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.[42] In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""[42] Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.[42] There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.[42] Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.[42] The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.[42] Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""[42] The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.[42] Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.[64] The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.[64] These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.[42] Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.[42] Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.[42] ""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time."" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College[86] Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”[86] "" REFERENCES: <a href='http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/references.shtml'>http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/references.shtml ========================================================== Argument against carbon dating. Taken from: <a href='http://www.creationworldview.org/articles_view.asp?id=6'>http://www.creationworldview.org/articles_view.asp?id=6 ""The Carbon14 ""dating"" method was introduced by Dr. W. F. Libby at the University of Chicago in 1948. He claimed that it was capable of dating animal, vegetable and human remains of fairly ""recent' origin. Recent, that is, for an evolutionist. Carbon14 is a long-lived radioactive isotope of Carbon. Carbon12 is the normal stable isotope of Carbon, which is the basic building block of organic life forms. As they say on Star Trek, we are all carbon based units. Laboratory research has shown that the radioactive decay of Carbon14 occurs in a half-life of 5,730 years. That means that starting with one pound of 100% Carbon14, half of it would decay in 5,730 years, leaving 50%, or half a pound. Then, in another 5,730 years, a second decay period would occur, leaving one quarter of a pound. The process would continue, halving the amount left every 5,730 years until, theoretically, nothing remained of the original pound. Carbon14 is produced in the upper atmosphere through the bombardment of Nitrogen (approximately 80% of atmospheric gases) by neutrons which come from the powerful cosmic radiation, primarily generated by the sun. This bombardment causes a nuclear reaction to take place. The Carbon14 produced by this process is then converted into Carbon Dioxide, just as normal Carbon12 is becomes Carbon Dioxide. The Carbon(14)Dioxide is then utilized by plants during their normal metabolism. Animals and humans who eat these plants take the Carbon14 into their systems just as they would Carbon(12)Dioxide. There is then a ratio of Carbon14 to Carbon12 in the bodies of plants, animals and humans which could be considered as ""fixed"" at the time of death. After death, the Carbon14 would decay and the ratio of the two isotopes would change. Evolutionists then claim to determine the amount of time since the death of the organism by measuring this ratio. The lower the amount of Carbon14, the longer it has been since death occurred. As you can see, the theoretical limit of the usefulness of Carbon14 would only be about 50,000 years. This would be the amount of time it would take for nine half-lives, and after that there would not be enough left to measure accurately. There are, however, many assumptions which have led to serious flaws in this supposedly useful method. First, one must assume that the decay rate of Carbon14 has remained constant and not varied over the years. This is an unwarranted assumption. There is evidence to indicate that quite the opposite is true. Experiments done with the radioactive isotopes of Uranium238 and Iron57 have shown that rates not only do vary, but can, in fact, be altered by changing the environment surrounding the samples. Second, there is the assumption that the formation of Carbon14 has been constant throughout the years. This, too, is a totally unwarranted view for two reasons. The Industrial Revolution caused a significant increase in the amount of Carbon12 in the atmosphere through the burning of coal. In addition, the initiation of atomic bomb testing on July 16, 1945, and the subsequent above ground testing that followed, caused a rise in neutrons which in turn increased Carbon14 concentrations around the world. Third, the assumption is made that the concentrations of Carbon14 and Carbon12 have remained constant in the atmosphere. Besides the aforementioned items, the amount of cosmic radiation in the past, and in particular the amount reaching the atmosphere, may have been dramatically different. If one were to believe the Bible, the earth was surrounded by a layer of water vapor between Creation and the Flood. If this water vapor did exist in the past, then it would have effectively shielded the atmosphere from cosmic radiation. This shielding would have drastically reduced the amount of Carbon14 produced. Fourth, Dr. Libby assumed that the amount of Carbon14 being produced in the present had reached equilibrium with the amount of Carbon12; he assumed that the two were in balance with each other. Since Carbon14 is a radioactive element, it starts to decay immediately upon formation. If you start with zero Carbon14 in the atmosphere, it would take 50,000+ years for the amount being produced to equal the amount decaying. One of the reasons that we know the earth is younger than 50,000 years old is that the amount of Carbon14 in the environment is only 78% of the amount that it should be, if the earth were old. Fifth, evolutionists have assumed that all plants and animals take in and utilize Carbon14 equally in their systems as they do Carbon12. Quite the contrary is true! Mollusks found alive off the coast of Hawaii have had their shells dated with the Carbon14 method. The shells were calculated to have died 2,000 years ago, yet the animals were still alive. Natural crude oil has been dated using the Carbon14 technique; yet evolutionists would teach that oil is too old to be dated using Carbon14. The grass used as part of the mortar in an old English castle, known to have been built only 800 years ago, was dated by Carbon14 to be thousands of years old. The list of non-compliant dates derived by Carbon14 is literally endless. All of these assumptions have caused there to be considerable overestimates using the Carbon14 technique. Today, most evolutionists, including Dr. Libby, would agree that the method is at best usable for only a few thousand years. In 1970, Dr. R. L. Whitlaw, collected a database of 15,000 Carbon14 dates attributed to various plant, animal and human remains. He grouped these three categories and then studied the patterns they formed. He found a number of significant points.  Whitlaw noticed that the number of human and animal remains increased from 7,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago. At that point there was an abrupt decrease in the populations to one-tenth the previous amount, followed by a slow and gradual increase to the present. He also noticed that the populations of creatures in North and South America lagged behind the population numbers in Africa and Europe. While I would disagree somewhat with the exact dates he attributes to the samples, both of his observations would be consistent with the biblical record. The Bible paints a picture of life initially originating in the Middle East and migrating across the world. This migration and growth in population would then be punctuated by the death of most air-breathing land-dwelling creatures in the Flood of Noah. After the Flood we would expect to see the same migration and population growth patterns develop for a second time. Perhaps the best description of the problem in attempting to use the Carbon14 dating method is to be found in the words of Dr. Robert Lee. In 1981, he wrote an article for the Anthropological Journal of Canada, in which stated: ""The troubles of the radiocarbon dating method are undeniably deep and serious. Despite 35 years of technological refinement and better understanding, the underlying assumptions have been strongly challenged, and warnings are out that radiocarbon may soon find itself in a crisis situation. Continuing use of the method depends on a fix-it-as-we-go approach, allowing for contamination here, fractionation there, and calibration whenever possible. It should be no surprise, then, that fully half of the dates are rejected. The wonder is, surely, that the remaining half come to be accepted. No matter how useful it is, though, the radiocarbon method is still not capable of yielding accurate and reliable results. There are gross discrepancies, the chronology is uneven and relative, and the accepted dates are actually the selected dates."" There you have it! The Carbon14 'dating"" method is as invalid as the evolutionary philosophy for which it was introduced and supposed to support!"" ========================================================== Another argument against radiocarbon dating. Taken from:http://creation.com/diamonds-a-creationists-best-friend Too long, can't post most of it! Objections (technical) and answers  1. The 14C readings in the diamonds are the result of background radiation in the detector. This shows that the objector doesn’t even understand the method. AMS doesn’t measure radiation but counts atoms. It was the obsolete scintillation method that counted only decaying atoms, so was far less sensitive. In any case, the mean of the 14C/C ratios in Dr Baumgardner’s diamonds was close to 0.12±0.01 pMC, well above that of the lab’s background of purified natural gas (0.08 pMC).  2. The 14C was produced by U-fission (this was an excuse proposed for 14C in coal, also analysed in Dr Baumgardner’s paper, but not possible for diamonds). But to explain the observed 14C, then the coal would have to contain 99% uranium, so colloquial parlance would term the sample ‘uranium’ rather than ‘coal’.1  3. The 14C was produced by neutron capture by 14N impurities in the diamonds. But this would generate less than one ten-thousandth of the measured amount even in best case scenarios of normal decay. And as Dr Paul Giem points out:  ‘One can hypothesize that neutrons were once much more plentiful than they are now, and that is why there is so much carbon-14 in our experimental samples. But the number of neutrons required must be over a million times more than those found today, for at least 6,000 years; and every 5,730 years that we put the neutron shower back doubles the number of neutrons required. Every time we halve the duration of the neutron shower we roughly double its required intensity. Eventually the problem becomes insurmountable. In addition, since nitrogen-14 captures neutrons 110,000 times more easily than does carbon-13, a sample with 0.000 0091% nitrogen should have twice the carbon-14 content of a sample without any nitrogen. If neutron capture is a significant source of carbon-14 in a given sample, radiocarbon dates should vary wildly with the nitrogen content of the sample. I know of no such data. Perhaps this effect should be looked for by anyone seriously proposing that significant quantities of carbon-14 were produced by nuclear synthesis in situ.’2   Also, if atmospheric contamination were responsible, the entire carbon content would have to be exchanged every million years or so. But if this were occurring, we would expect huge variations in radiocarbon dates with porosity and thickness, which would also render the method useless.1 Dr Baumgardner thus first thought that the 14C must have been there right from the beginning. But if nuclear decay were accelerated, say a recent episode of 500 million years worth, it could explain some of the observed amounts. Indeed, his RATE colleagues have shown good evidence for accelerated decay in the past, which would invalidate radiometric dating.  4. The 14C ‘dates’ for the diamonds of 55,700 years were still much older than the biblical timescale. This misses the point: we are not claiming that this ‘date’ is the actual age; rather, if the earth were just a million years old, let alone 4.6 billion years old, there should be no 14C at all! Another point is that the 55,700 years is based on an assumed 14C level in the atmosphere. Since no one, creationist or evolutionist, thinks there has been an exchange of carbon in the diamond with the atmosphere, using the standard formula for 14C dating to work out the age of a diamond is meaningless. Also, 14C dating assumes that the 14C/C ratio has been constant. But the Flood must have buried huge numbers of carbon-containing living creatures, and some of them likely formed today’s coal, oil, natural gas and some of today’s fossil-containing limestone. Studies of the ancient biosphere indicate that there was several hundred times as much carbon in the past, so the 14C/C ratio would have been several hundred times smaller. This would explain the observed small amounts of 14C found in ‘old’ samples that were likely buried in the Flood. Reference  1.

Taken from: ""The tiny bombardier beetle could not possibly have evolved. His defence mechanism is amazingly complicated, and could only have been created with all the parts working together perfectly. From twin ‘exhaust tubes’ at his tail, this beetle fires into the face of his enemies boiling-hot noxious gases with a loud pop. How can this be? German chemist Dr Schildknecht discovered that the beetle mixes two chemicals (hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone) which would usually form a dirty ugly mixture. The well-designed beetle uses a special ‘inhibitor’ chemical to keep the mixture from reacting. How then can the explosion instantaneously occur when needed? Dr Schildknecht discovered that in the beetle’s specially designed combustion tubes are two enzymes called catalase and peroxidase which make chemical reactions go millions of times faster. These chemicals catalyze the extremely rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and the oxidation of hydroquinone into quinone, causing them to violently react and explode—but not so soon as to blow up the beetle, of course! Common sense tells us that this amazing little insect cannon which can fire four or five ‘bombs’ in succession could not have evolved piece by piece. Explosive chemicals, inhibitor, enzymes, glands, combustion tubes, sensory communication, muscles to direct the combustion tubes and reflex nervous systems—all had to work perfectly the very first time—or all hopes for ‘Bomby’ and his children would have exploded!

Origin of Life. Why do textbooks claim that the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment shows how life’s building blocks may have formed on the early Earth—when conditions on the early Earth were probably nothing like those used in the experiment, and the origin of life remains a mystery?  2. Darwin’s Tree of Life. Why don’t textbooks discuss the “Cambrian explosion,” in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed, instead of branching from a common ancestor—thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life?  3. Homology. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry—a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence?  4. Vertebrate Embryos. Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry—even though biologists have known vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages, and the drawings are faked?  5. Archaeopteryx. Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds—even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it?  6. Peppered Moths. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection—when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don’t normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged?  7. Darwin’s Finches. Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection—even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no evolution remained?  8. Mutant Fruit Flies. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution—even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory?  9. Human Origins. Why are artists’ drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident—when fossil experts cannot even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like?  10.

You might not be closed minded, but then you're not a typical Christian. Typical Christians often believe in things directly opposed to your open-minded beliefs, so if we are asked if Christians are often too close minded, we can say yes."	Well, most of us. Im also a Christian or Catholic, and there are some things that we really dont understand. But first, Id like you to hear my point here. I do agree that most of us are close minded, but at some point, we also think about what other people are saying. Like, considering that there are such things as gays, atheists, and other gods. You do realize that, we are not close minded at all. Because most of us also believe in the art of science, and accept man's creation, like technology.. So with that, I could not conclude that we are close-minded. As for they pro-gay stuff.. There are certain things that we just dont understand. With that example, I agree that we are somehow close minded. We just believe that there are 2 genders or being created by God, which is the woman and man. But, we do not close that fact that there are really homosexuals emerging from the two genders. Its obvious that we see gays now in our world.	0
If one side can use their book, the other side can use theirs. Fair is fair.	But not all books are created equally. But seriously though, while I would never claim that you cannot use the Bible (or any religious book) in a debate, any book that hs been proven at least partially faulty (whether a book of religion, or of science) cannot be treated as reliable a source of information in the same way that another book is, in which no faults have yet been found.	0

He actually wanted to send the African-Americans to Panama. He then changed his views and realized that he was wrong. Without Lincoln you may be living in the CSA.	"Without Lincoln the south wouldn't have gotten the whole ""were gonna shove this bill down your throat because were federalists"" message and they likely would not have seceded. Seriously, every other major power was able to get rid of slavery peacefully. And he did change his views, he was the one who came up with the whole Back to Africa (Liberia) idea. As for me living in the Confederate States of America, you see to not understand two things: 1. Lincoln did not run the military, that would be his generals. 2. If it wasn't for Lincoln the south would likely not have seceded and we would have been able to abolish slavery peacefully instead of starting the bloodiest war in American history."	0

(1)If you want to be technical the only real vampire is Vlad the impaler, and perhaps serial killers who drank human blood, but we aren't talking about technical we're speaking about fictional vampiric figure. Although I don't follow twilight and Vamp Diaries, True blood does have very realistically portrayed vampires. (2)We outnumber them, knowing they exist will cause weapons against them to be made, and if they should ever rise to be a threat, those weapons will be used. (3)Agreed (4) I stated that there'd be some who wouldn't follow the rules, but since they came from being human some of them might follow the rules with the exception of the bad eggs that will be held accountable for their actions, just like with some humans who feel they are above the rest of the human race i.e. Hitler. (5)Got me on that one. :P	(1) I agree we are talking more about the fictional vampire, although I tend to lean towards more traditional rather than contemporary conception. I have not watched enough of True Blood to counter your counter with any particular detail, however I tend not to like conceptions that treat vampires as basically human with largely human culture and social practices; they are a different species. (2) Not necessarily. Humans used to be outnumbered by other predatory species but because of having an evolutionary/biological advantages came to outnumber and dominate those species. I would argue that vampires come into a world with all of the advantages humans enjoy, plus advantages unique to them, without some of the vulnerabilities of humans, and with unique in-vulnerabilities, while having very few and generally minimal unique disadvantages. Relying on the creation of special weapons which may or not actually be developed (how do you actually counter rapid cell regeneration for instance?) seems shaky grounds to claim humans would win a conflict. Furthermore, there would likely be considerable cover up by governments so the initial advantage would not be as great as you imply. (4) I do not think it follows that since vampires were once humans they would continue to feel affinity with humans. For one, the transformation includes a shift in brain chemistry and mentality. For another, human rejection would prompt a quick re-identification with vampires and away from humans. (5) Splendid. :)	0

"Atheists is given to people who believe in science, more or less. You have religion or science. Most people don't say ""I'm not religious, I'm a scientist"" Atheists can mean that they have no beliefs what so ever. so calling them liars or miss-understanding just because you believe everyone should believe in religion dosn't make them not right, it makes you look like a cocky jerk who dosn't know when to quit.

My provocative opening statement is directed to people who make that ridiculous claim(and others just like it). Y'all have shown up as the majority, as I strongly suspected. lol you believe everyone should believe in religion  I believe people should view religion for what it is. They should object when they notice something objectionable. They should also praise activity they deem praiseworthy.

"Life is literally nothing but a hugely complicated chemical system. This view is directly entailed by the second law of thermodynamics, and it explains why there's no fundamental gap between life and non-life. Take out the word life and replace it with ""The Universe."" Which would be correct. You are only explaining the existence of things and how they exist. Those things you explain as non-living are well... non-living. They do still exist, but they are non-living. Yes, everything is a complex chemical system, but that is only explaining how everything and everybody exist. It's whether the chemical reactions are actually creating life or not. That's what matters. That's the difference between living and existing, because not everything that exist is a living organism. The difference between non-living things and living things is right there in the definition. Compare and contrast: Rocks; came into existence from chemicals reactions so they exist. Animals and people; came into existence through chemical reactions so they exist, but they are also alive Compare: they both exist Contrast: animals and people are alive, but rocks are not. Now you see a difference?"	It's whether the chemical reactions are actually creating life or not. Define life for me. What makes something alive as opposed to not alive? Why are people full of life when stone aren't?	0
"Yeah the president is black, so what! In fact, to put that in the pro sides advantage, our president has been accused for many crimes by Republicans, conservatives, Tea Party activist, etc. So, overall, just because your the president it doesn't mean anything. Its a victory for black people in America, but that is just one person, not the majority of African Americans. White guilt is NEVER over. Although, many white people have finally made sense that the division of the American nation has brought nothing but conflict, there are still supremacists who disagree and have a flame of hatred towards colored people that it will never go out. There are still racist confederates, KKK, the racist kind of skinheads, and the Neo-Nazi who are all still existent today that hate African Americans or of that descendant. The fact you said that it is ""stuff that can't be helped"" is truly what bothered me the most from your argument. It can be helped and my evidence is the history of America in the 1960's where civil rights movements ""helped"" elevate black people and color people in general. In the end, black people (but really it should say colored people in general) have been treated unfairly. I wouldn't say like bullshit, as we already achieved our rights during the 1960's. Yet, we still face prejudice from white people, but know that I am talking about a certain group of white people, not as a whole. I am not as rash to say all southerner whites are racist as its not true at all."	You can't help being black, is what I meant. White guilt IS over, at least for me. If you try hard, you can be anything you want to. Life isn't easy for anything, so you gotta work hard. If you wanna be president, you gotta work hard. You wanna be a scientist, you gotta be smart.

And where did you get this information? I would greatly appreciate if you provide the source of it. One thing is for sure.. Insulin doesnt have to be tested with animals because people have insulin in their body, its either they lack insulin or they have an excess insulin level in their blood. So why'd you have to test it to animals if you already know that insulin is already on the body of a person? AIDS Cocktail.. never heard of it. Kindly inform me about these things because I would like to learn.	The insulin given to diabetics is not quite the same, which is why it was first tested on animals. Originally it was bovine insulin, although now I believe most people use synthetic insulin due to adverse reactions to the animal based version. This information can be found in Peter Singer's book, Animal Liberation, or in the Encyclopedia of Bio Ethics, 3rd Edition. Also, you will find information on the AIDS cocktail, the mix of pills given to people with HIV to try and manage the virus. These pills have saved many lives, provided they are taken correctly, but failed in animal studies.	0
Pretty much because all atheist believe in some form of scientific knowledge.	Believing in some form of scientific knowledge is not religion.

This is known as the riddle of Epicurus and it addresses the problem of evil (natural disasters) for the existence of god. God has the character trait of being loving and caring for his creation, by refuting this trait of his character we refute his credibility of existence.  Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?  Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing?  Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing?  Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing?  Then why call him God?	I'm familiar with it, as I would imagine anyone who'd discuss this topic is. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. So?	0

I think to say that they are heartless is a strech. To them, the tradgey is more of a statistic to them, not nessicary because they are cruel.

I do understand what you mean, that the events recently can serve as exposure or awareness to a certain issue.

well, look at it like this: if you like the feeling of your socks off at night when you sleep, the only way you can know the satisfaction and feeling of that is by wearing socks all day, and then taking them off. And even though its a touchy subject, the strength and willpower that can be achieved by being a victim of rape is a phenomenal trait earned, at a very high cost, but, again, the only way to know how strong of a person you are is to feel	Sometimes it is better to live life without certain feelings, I believe that drugs give a person instant gratification as it influences the brain to illusions of pleasure, but in reality it damages the body. If people become addicted to these sorts of stimulants then they would eventually regret it. Isn't it our duty in society to protect people from feeling these sort of things? It's like that a person who was a victim of rape would be fearful and distrust people for the rest of their life. They would probably see less value in having sex as it has been used as a form of violation and oppression on them.	0
Support for the dumbing down policies of state/public education to be applied to the many, the working class, for whom they apparently support, yet send their own children to private schools, and oppose the privatization of school through vouchers. Education and science are inherently liberal disciplines. The conservative stance has generally been championing of the common man, using common sense, and other forms of anti-intellectualism. Gun Control Contempt for the moral values of ordinary people  Cherry picking issues can always make your stance appear supported when in fact it is marginal to the whole picture. Everyone is equal, yet many liberal elite has been accused of not paying taxes or tax fraud.  Not really relevant to your issue. Equality means that everyone has or ought to have equal rights, based on the idea that we ought to be treated like we are all equals so as to stamp out social turmoil. Believe in that more government is good, and businesses are bad. More government = more control. Of course, being a libertarian, you bought into the sleight of hand that business freedom equals individual freedom. So obviously to you, regulating businesses means suddenly we all are more regulated and less free... or something.	you bought into the sleight of hand that business freedom equals individual freedom. Our political freedom is derived from the economic freedom that was and is prevalent in Great Britain. The law protected landowners' rights. And in England land is king. So each landowner was his own master, thus we have political freedom.	0
But what do the laws matter? The law can tell me not to be prejudiced, but they have no true control over my feelings - my beliefs. That is not the issue. The issue is whether the laws and the justice system should be prejudiced. I care nothing for what people think of each other, but the law should be impartial to discrimination.  But with globalism, the world is becoming more and more compact - more unified. There is no longer any individuality. You've no choice but to conform. Then rebel. Take Nova Roma - they are a rather large group of people who wish to 'go back to Rome', so to speak. To return to the Roman ways. That cannot be in this society. Too many rules, too many laws. Ways have changed. That is why I prefer, if government is required, libertarianism. The government should not interfere in every aspect of life. The tyranny of the multitudes. Regardless, this is not the issue. I sympathise with you, but this is about ethnicity and the exceptions laws make for it. They shouldn't have the power to dictate night everything: what you eat, drink; how you raise your children; what you can and cannot purchase, etc., etc. No, they should not. This is not about authoritarianism. I'm lost on this matter: where do the Amish live? America. They were offered religious refuge.  Are there exemptions to rules made specifically for the Amish? This is a completely new topic for me. I never mentioned the Amish, you did. They did not even occur to me. I'm not sure if they even qualify as an ethnic group. But that's not how it is. Of course it isn't. In America each state elects representatives. Those representatives are supposed to act for the majority. But do they? No. They represent their own interests. If people were to have power over the making of each law, then America would truly be a democracy, in my mind. That has always been my position.  Without law I can have all the privacy I want. Without law, I can take my privacy by force, if need be. True. Without law, there wouldn't be - what's-the-number? 1,000,000 - security cameras all over London watching peoples' every moves. New Labour have never done anything good. Never. Don't get me started on them (unless you like rants of volcanic proportions). So what America has is more of a dictatorship. vote fraud gives the president power, he keeps that power via the military, or, with Obama, a civilian army. Correct. Democracy is a veil for despotism.  All that I want is freedom. Freedom to live a life without looking behind my back every minute, being hounded by government cameras and extremely powerful government agencies. All that I want is to live in peace - my peace, not some false sense of security given me by the government. Government and law are not mutually dependent. There could be a justice system which can punish criminals, but be unable to make laws or do anything beyond administering justice. All other services would be private, as would the right to make laws. The democratic dream. The capitalist dream. My dream.	"Then rebel. Oh, believe me, if it ever gets to so great a level of control, I most certainly shall. They were offered religious refuge. Just what does this mean? I know nothing about the Amish. I'm not sure if they even qualify as an ethnic group. They are not a separate ethnic group, but they are a distinct and separate society. No. They represent their own interests. That has always been my position.  True. New Labour have never done anything good. Never.  Correct. Democracy is a veil for despotism.  It would seem that we agree on many issues. Don't get me started on them (unless you like rants of volcanic proportions). Yes, I do. But not of volcanic proportions, I'd prefer one of super-calderic proportions (behemoth, if you will). There could be a justice system which can punish criminals, but be unable to make laws or do anything beyond administering justice. Who, in your mind, should make the laws? I believe, as I stated, that all the necessary laws were made long ago. These are just about all the laws that I believe are necessary: (""T"" = augmentation) You shall not murder You shall not commit adultery T You shall not steal T - With regards to rape, etc. I suppose that I am quite the individualist. would the right to make laws. So to whom would that right belong?"	0
What are you talking about? I'm saying those within the church who get upset at the church for standing it's ground on homosexuality can leave, because the faith is certainly not for them. If the church wants to marry gays then go find another backward church that doesn't want to marry gays. If you want to deny people happiness you can go off and do it if the Catholic Church changes. I said that in response to the suggestion that if the church doesn't start marrying gays, people will leave the church. Again, let them leave the church.  I said that people will leave if the church doesn't change, what's the problem here? People have always left the church, in masses, yet, the church remains, especially when it holds its ground. Do you have an example? The church could also survive by adapting. Surviving is one thing, thriving another. The church still being around is not that great an accomplishment.	"The problem is that people cannot demand the church go against the faith that it professes. If the people no longer wish to profess faith, they should no longer profess faith than force the church to become untrue to its profession of faith so that they may to profess faith.  ""Do you have an example?"" The Catholic church has commanded many followers since the protestants split away, and since secularism began in the Renaissance. In a sexually promiscuous world, the Catholic church has maintained its views on issues like birth control and abortion, and same-sex marriage.  It has held firm to its traditional beliefs and must continue to do so. I think more people will leave the faith if it caved in to the ""band wagon"" of same-sex marriage."	0

If it happened once, why isn't it happening now? My great-great grandparents were not reptiles. I'm not arguing that genealogies don't happen.

Beastiality is sick, they can't tell you whether they want it or not its forces onto them it is rape and they can do nothing to stop it if they dislike it. There was a story in my town of a man who pretty much raped a dog, his wife walked in on him doing so and could tell that the dog didn't want this. Beastiality is animal rape because they cannot give consent to it and it is forced on then not only that it is an act of cruelty that should never be allowed. If you rape an animal because you don't have a woman or something go find a woman/man to have sex with instead at least the it's not rape and you won't get fined/arrested.	How about bestiality where it may be an animal doing the giving and a person receiving? I think it's more that the fact that it's forced. Animals carry all sorts of unknown diseases plus it's seen as odd that you would want to have interspecies sex at all.	0

1. You failed to considered the meaning of omnibenevolent, and what that means when combined with the two other properties. The bible is irrelevant to the logic of combining those three properties.  2. Free will is an absurd concept. Further more, punishment for such things(especially the type god is typically said to enforce) is not an act of a Omnibenevolent god.	"The definition of ""Omnibenevolence"" is as follows: All-loving, or infinitely good, regarding an individual's persona or character, usually in reference to a deity or supernatural being, for example, 'God'. It's use is often with regards to the divine triad, whereby a deity is described to be simultaneously omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent. This triad is used especially with the Christian god, Yahweh. The definition of ""Omniscient"" is ""all knowing and ever wise."" Likewise, the definition of ""Omnipotent"" is ""almighty, all powerful with unstaggering force."" These definitions are provided per ""The Oxford Dictionary of English"", 1989. I believe it is you, sir, who has failed to consider these three properties in conjunction. The bible stated what God is; omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient. Since the information on God strictly comes from the bible, it is the only logical reference that is relevant to combining these properties. Simply because God is all knowing, all powerful and infinitely good does not compel him to restrict human liberty, which would be the act of a janus God. Even if humans ""choose"" to behave in absurdly malicious and insidious manners, God will not confront them and prohibit their will. The presence of so called ""evil"" is not a viable argument against the Judeo-Christian God.  If God were to stand idly by and watch a man rape a little girl, it is clear how most atheists would consider this ""impotence"" as ""evil"" and contradictory to his professed ""omnipotence."" However, God is unwilling to dictate his ""creation's"" actions and thus waits to judge those individuals. If human life on this side was perfect, why would there need to be a ""heaven""? The scriptures state that this life is necessary to judge and test our reactions and contributions in a form of ""weeding out"" those who are most unsavoury and insidious.  Are courts of law considered heinous for sentencing hardened criminals guilty of murder in the first degree? Not likely. Those individuals are guilty of their crimes and must pay for them."	0

" because they think Atheism is the root of all evil proving my point Nope. The love of money is the root of all evil. Even says so in the bible. A true Christian would know that.   Second of all it is practically impossible to ""live in a godly lifestyle"" since their religion makes too many contradictions one of the reasons that I am an Atheist I feel so free of that bullshit! Contradictions? Most are scribe errors and translational errors like something contradicts in the KJV and then doesn't in the NIV. Its just the translator. Also we don't read the Greek or Hebrew so we can't tell exactly what it says until you study it and so far I haven't seen anyone who argued for a contradiction in those. Another thing is that some aren't even contradictions. People just don't understand it or don't take the time to think about it. For example the God of Anger and God of Peace ""contradiction"". If one thinks for a moment they will realize that that isn't even a contradiction.  Third of all their is in fact a poll that says Atheists are the most mistrusted minority as you can see in the video below. Highly doubt they are mistrusted. Say your an Atheist in public and you are fine. Say you are a Christian and people go against you. They even started taking of the little cross on the ""co-exist"" signs."	0
Are you freaking kidding me? Floyd Mayweather Jr. is a freaking monster. His agility would play for keeps on the street. His tiny fists of fury would pummel any competition. After the fight, I wouldn't be surprised if he just started punching potholes in the pavement!	"Judging from your statements, you probably thought that the Mayweather/De La Hoya fight was an amazingly display of athleticism as well. Yes, Mayweather is an athlete, but he's not the Only athlete on the planet. On HBO's show 24/7 leading up to the fight with De La Hoya, Mayweather threw 6,636 punches in PRACTICE. In the actual fight where he made more than 50 million, he threw 636... The general thinking of fighting can pretty much be summed up by Mickey in (one of the) Rocky (movies)""Rock, to go 10 rounds, YA GOTTA BE ABLE TO GO A HUNDRED ROUNDS""... Mayweather, the ""monster"", did just the opposite. This proves that while he may be an athlete, and a performer, he is definitely NOT a fighter, and he would have no chance against someone with similar physical capabilities but many more weapons at his disposal."	0

Why would you use the term happy holidays? I guess you don't have a problem pissing off the very minute population that doesn't celebrate holidays. Yes, they are out there. What percent of the population are you fine with pissing off? 10%,1%, .0001%. I could care less who I piss off, it just doesn't make sense to me to wish someone you don't know merry Christmas, it just makes more sense to grant people happy holidays. If people are really pissed off at me over something like that, those aren't people I want to be peechy keen with. If someone gets mad at me for saying happy holidays, their being ridiculous, why would I give a shit? Most people don't ever have a problem with me when I tell them happy holidays... I wouldn't expect less... I am playing devils advocate here being a Christian who believes Merry Christmas is not offensive to others. My Jewish friends tell me Happy Hanukkah at this time of the year. Does not offend me. But if we don't want to offend anybody, then Happy Holidays has to go also. main point I was trying to make is this war on Christmas thing is ridiculous, I think there has been a high amount of tension over how people greet each other during the holidays. It's not even about offending people to me, I am naturally polite person (well socially at least, otherwise I'm a bit of slob XD) and I feel happy holidays is more courteous, it is a personal choice not to walk around on eggshells, or not to avoid offending anyone, not to be politically correct or as if I am fighting for a principal, but merely because it makes more sense to me, and seems socially more sensible.	There is a war on Christmas. Every year at this time the ACLU goes around filing lawsuits, many of them frivolous in an effort to wipe Christmas out. What I find fucking hillarious is liberals that want to refer to it as a holiday tree and then file lawsuits claiming it is religious. Can't have it both ways.	0
I know that many agreed for the divorce bill, but the government should be relative of the situation. I disagree because of what will happen to the lives of Filipinos. Divorce is a sin, to God and to others, as for me I'm very religious, I believe that divorce should not be implemented in the Philippines because we are known for our values possessed throughout time.	"I disagree because of what will happen to the lives of Filipinos. What? because they may have a chance at directing their own happiness?  Divorce is a sin, to God and to others, This should have no bearing on man-made law, and why is it important anyway, if divorce is legal it does not change the fact that it is against the church.  How about ""you"" don't get divorced because ""you"" don't agree with it, but ""you"" keep ""your"" sanctimonious religious views out of everyone else's business.  I believe that divorce should not be implemented in the Philippines because we are known for our values possessed throughout time. Sorry to burst your bubble mate, but known by who? I've never heard or seen anything that exclaims ""Oh those Filipinos, if there is one thing I know about them it's they've got great values"" I've heard of Human rights violations and warlords, but traditional values, not your international strong point."	0

"""Define That"" is vague. What part of the statement don't you understand. You don't really expect me to define every word in the statement do you? I am just confused :/ Is what are you saying is that all churches should merge?"	"No. I am basically asking, ""is there one true Christian church, or if Christianity is flexible enough to allow for difference of belief?"""	0
Answer to your example: Homeschooling. How can the uneducated educate? Flexibility is best. For instance, the Amish need not purchase health insurance despite Obamacare. I read that link, it was condemning of flexibility. As am I, for that matter. seeking equality by making one rule for some and another for others is just stupid. Equality is impossible until all people are treated as equals.	"How can the uneducated educate? Books. Reading. Curriculum. I taught myself nearly everything I needed to know by reading books. Surely Gypsies can do the same. On second thought, why do they need to be ""educated"" by modern standards? Why can't they just live as they always have - they're well enough off. Why should they be forced to change? I read that link, it was condemning of flexibility. The views of the writer of said link are irrelevant. seeking equality by making one rule for some and another for others is just stupid. So you expect all people to conform to the same ""mould""? Let's say, for instance, that I am a Gypsy. My life and the life of my 'people' have been traveling to and fro for many generations - first in Eastern Europe and now in America - and now, because the government decides that children should go to school, I am expected to change? After hundreds of years, my people would have adapted over the generations to replace such a need. Why should I change for you? Another example: Let's say that I am Amish. I and my 'people' have lived this way for many hundreds of years. Rather than adapting to modern 'conveniences' we have remained as were our ancestors. Now, the fundamentals of my society are being threatened by many different obstacles: laws regarding schooling, insurance, corporal punishment - everything is becoming a threat to us. Why should I have to change? Why can I not continue living as I and my peoples have for generations? We've never done you any wrong. Equality is impossible until all people are treated as equals. Yet all people shall never be treated as equals. People do not get along. there are differences between one and another and few are willing to forget them."	0

"Not necessarily. Persons of different professions can have the same political ideology. Not all supporters of Hitler were Nazis.  Differences in ideology is only antagonistic to ""state values"" if those values are counter to ideological diversity. This is a contradiction. You're saying that the only ideologies not against the state's ideology are those diverse from it. Different professions don't have to be opposed to each other, but diverse ideologies must be. A nation cannot be consistent if it is both capitalistic and communistic.  The flaw with an economic action isn't in whether it's challenged or not, it's based on the context of the economy. A good idea is a good idea regardless of if it is challenged or not."	Different people in different professions may have the same political ideology, however you will find different distributions of political ideology in different types of professions.  Two different ideologies don't have to be mutually exclusive. For example, many communists support a period of regulated capitalism. My original statement was that a state's values only oppose another ideology if the state's values are ones that only consider a narrow band of ideas plausible. For example if a state has a value of monogamy, then it would consider any non-monogamy as counter to it but if a state values relationships in general then it would not. A different meaning than how you interpreted the original statement.  How do you know if its a good idea unless it is challenged/tested?	0

There's not much to look into as far as Rorschach is concerned besides the bloody mess he made in the antarctic after Manhattan explod'd him. To be sure, Rorschach does have some neat appeal, but Batman's is a little more long lasting, and there's tons more development for that playboy than Rorschach, since he was a character developed for a single story. Conveniently, I've done research on both of these characters for class,(Don't. Don't ask.) and while Rorschach is a neat character, he doesn't really stand much on his own, because of the elements of the plot in that story he plays into. A lot of the themes are lost if you compare just him to another comic-book character. I'm not much for cheesy superhero comics, but there's some pretty swag batman story-arcs out there, and he's a surprisingly endurant and multifaceted character. Definitely more lasting appeal.	Fair enough, but I just can't get Adam West out of my head when thinking of Batman. -_-	0
At no other stage in one's life, though, does a person cry about pointless things as much as a baby. The baby is the only stage in life in which their id compels them to selfishly cry over meaningless things without any remorse. The point of the term 'cry-baby' is to compare your whining and pointless crying to that of a baby. Do you see people crying over important things as being called 'cry-babyies'? Of course not.	Actually when a baby cries it is not for pointless reasons. It cries because it cannot speak or do anything (change it's own diaper e.t.c) Older people cry more for stupid reasons than babies actually. It is in the babies nature but for us it is not we may not be able to control our emotions all the time. Plus how can a baby cry for pointless reasons when it hardly understands anything in the world apart from 'eat, sleep, poop, burp' you cannot blame a baby for crying then.	0

Your statements and conclusion are quite assumptive. Just because particular advantages may be accompanied by other disadvantages (and vice versa), it does not follow that this is necessarily the norm. It is rather idealistic I think to believe that some people are not more advantaged than others. To me, inequality in ability and other attributes is an inherent aspect of any species and humanity is certainly not an exception.	Darwin, who I adore a lot, said that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior being in a species but rather one whose specific set of disadvantages affect them the least in the surroundings and whose advantages affect them the most, it is this being which dominates the others in the fight for survival.	0

well, i say only baby food. that's it. the only way i support any financial aid for ESSENTIAL needs is for student aid.  so, basically, food stamps should only be used to buy baby food. and, it should only be supplied to people with babies (and they're too poor to support that child).	"Maybe what you mean is people who cannot be held responsible for their financial situations? I'm playing devils advocate here, but what about people on disability, people taking care of older people, like parents or grandparents? The more the government looks into certain people's situations, the more time and effort it takes... Would accurately deciding on who really needs it and who doesn't cost just as much tax money in hours worked to investigate the situation as it would to just give it to the people? I mean, if there was a tighter criteria, and everyone that signed up for government money met that criteria, and we were still investigating, it would cost more than if we weren't investigating at all... if the criteria were to be slimmed down, who would know if the people were being honest or not when they're filling out the paper work?  I think once you get into that problem you come up with solutions like... big brother. The government already knows whether or not you deserve the money or not, and it's just about pulling up records and clicking ""OK"". Specialized software could do that, but again, Software costs money, to develop, to apply, and the machines that would run the software, the infrastructure would need to be in place for the machines and the software to have the input... and besides all of that technical shit, we would need the people's approval, which you're not going to get anytime soon, even theoretically.

But what I'm saying is the first amendment says that you have the right to be any religion you want to be. And as every atheist I've ever asked has told me Atheism is not a religion therefor I don't see how it applies.	The first amendment is the right to freedom of religion, not just the right to freedom of choosing our religion. To have the freedom to have religion you need the freedom to not have religion. Let me put it to.you another way. You can buy a soda at the gas station.but they only have sprite, you don't have freedom to have ANY soda but you still have freedom to soda, if you HAVE to have a soda then where is the freedom in that? Freedom OF soda would be the combination of having freedom to any soda and the freedom of whether or not to have soda. I follow what you are saying. You are saying that it is freedom of religion thus you can have any religion, but that doesn't mean you are free to have no religion. I'm saying by only allowing the freedom to have religion, you are not really allowing that person to have truly have freedom of religion, they are forced to have religion. So you can't have freedom of religion without freedom from religion. Otherwise its just forcing someone to have religion.	0

"I don't know about you, but I don't see the chemical reaction between several atmospheric gases and electricity as a ""higher power"". Just because none of our scientists have managed to perform abiogenesis, does not mean it cannot happen. There are trillions of planets, and abiogenesis took 1.5 billion years to happen on Earth. So you're right, the odds are long. But we can allow those long odds, because even if they are a billion to one, there have been quadrillions of opportunities for life to have been created."	0

"The argument from evil doesn't pretend to be able to defeat every tenet of the Christian religion - or every tenet of any other religion, for that matter. It only critiques one thing: the concept of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being (a being whose existence espoused by a number of schools of theological thought), arguing that the existence of such a being would be inconsistent with known facts about the world. In this respect, it is the same as pretty much any other argument concerning the concept ""God"". Let me ask it this way: Why is it a fallacy to say that an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being cannot exist if evil exists and to provide supporting arguments? What makes such an argument a fallacy, other than the fact that you can't really know what something (e.g. God) is like? And if this fact is all that you're basing your claim of fallacy on, would you then say that every other argument that falls prey to this is also a fallacy? Would it be a fallacy for me to argue that children should eat their vegetables for the sake of their health, because I can't really know that vegetables are good for their health?"	"Because you're claiming that if God exists, he would HAVE TO BE a merciful, personal, caring God and therefore, an argument like ""evil coexists with God"" is merely an elementary tactic for Atheists who are afraid of reasoning.

"You said, "" It was perfected in the last years of WW2"", WW2 ended in 1945, it saw service in 1949, as it was created 2 years earlier. Explain to me if WW2 ended in 1945, how was the AK47 used in the ""last years of WW2""? The Avtomat Kalashnikova 47 was created in 1947, used in 1949. It was used from 1949 to present day.The AK47 became purchasable to other countries when the Soviet Union collapsed, Red Army soldiers used it in 1949! Read properly before disputing people it's called ignorance! ;)"	Why would I need to explain that to you, when I never said it was used in the last years? Read properly before disputing people multiple times- that's called ignorance. If it helps you, read what people say multiple times so you understand it.	0
Yes, I do feel as if He listens to me. When I pray with a clean heart and an ear to His will, everything that I have asked of Him has come true. The issue, though, is many of my prayers are not with a clean heart, with an ear to His will.	Ok, do me a favor, pray for God, right now to change my heart and make me believe in him. I'll wait while you pray.	0
Well according to the Bible in Psalms 14:1 it says whoever says in their heart that their is no God is a fool. And I obey what the Bible says so of course I think atheism is evil.

Weddings are useless. Men propose with no intentions of actual marriage because they believe in love but not marriage. Marriage is quaint idea, but it intentions are only for women.	Wow.....what shallow men we have on this site. Any man that would do what you are implying....is not worth being with. Boy there are a lot of weddings going on......really means boy are men stupid. Marriage is a wonderful institution. You must also have been hurt very badly...that or been marriage 4 or 5 times.  To say only women want marriage.....LOL	0

Yes, because they don't know what it feels like to be that other person. If they felt like that other person, then they would understand and would not be hateful.

"I agree love has to go both ways. So, I can't defend necrophilia (well, maybe I could; but it would get way too meta physical); but I can defend, well at least pose an argument, that love can go both ways between an animal and a human.  DISCLAIMER: I am not advocating bestiality. I am offering a logical argument disputing the statement ""...love goes only one way ...with bestiality"" and ""...the dog can not speak for himself..."". I am going to use the hypothetical scenario you used i.e. a man and a dog. {(A beautiful golden retriever named Sandy, with lushes flowing hair, mmmmhh... but I digress) that was humor so people don't take this so seriously, but look at the logic of the argument} okay. Any good pet owner who truly loves their pet (platonically, not trying to trap anyone) cannot deny that there grows a bond between the animal and themselves. It is accepted that humans can love their pets. I claim that a dogs feelings for a human can also be categorized as love. There have been innumerable instances of dogs throwing themselves into highly dangerous, if not outright suicidal situations, in order to try and protect their human companions. If risking your life for someone else isn't love, than I don't know what is.  So, i claim that establishes that love can exist between a dog and a man. This leads us to sexual desire. I'm sure a lot of you would say, ""yeah I love my dog, but I don't wanna boink her.""  However, there are some people who do want to have sex with their dogs. Critics will say that that sexual desire is wrong, because they can't understand it. I don't understand homosexual desires. NOTE: I am not comparing the two sexual desires. I am making a point that just because you don't understand a sexual desire does not make it wrong.  So, I have established; 1. Love can go both ways between a dog and a man, 2. Sexual desire for an animal is not necessarily wrong. This brings us to; does the dog have sexual desire for the human? This I think can be established with a simple empirical experiment. If a man can have sex with an unrestrained dog, without the dog running off, or attacking, or showing distress; I think that proves the dog's sexual desire for the man.  Now to ""...the dog can not speak for himself..."" Clearly the dog doesn't posses the ability to express his thoughts through any spoken human language. Consider; when you reach for a dogs food bowl while she is eating and he nips your hand or you get home from work and your dog runs up and licks your face, are these not ways in which a dog expresses her thoughts/feelings, or a way in which the dog speaks for herself.  In summary: love can go both ways between dog and human, there is a way to establish sexual desire between the two, and dogs can speak for their selves, just not in words; therefore a romantic union between animal and human is valid.  ONCE AGAIN: I am not advocating bestiality.  (gotta be careful around here)"	I know that love goes both ways between man and dog, for all I know the dog could be just as into the sex with his owner, as the owner is. But just because the dog goes up and licks your face, that isn't necessarily a sign that he wants to have sex with you. A lick in the face, is like a hug - not a kiss or a sexual invitation. If someone could prove in some weird way that their dog truly WANTS to be married and have a sexual relationship with them, then I don't see why they shouldn't. But as for now we have not developed any technology that allows us to communicate with a dog. We have the training stuff, where we tell a dog to lie down, then he lies down. But we have not any equipment to ask a dog a question, where that answer is based on the Dog's own opinions and feelings.	0
They are my own. Lol  I don't form many of my judgments until I've gone through the facts myself usually.

1. God is claimed to be perfectly moral. Moral by His definition, not yours. 3. God commanded Isaac to kill his own son to demonstrate his conviction. To demonstrate to Isaac Isaac's conviction. 4. He knew before hand of Isaac's conviction, and such a command is unecessary (due to 2) Yet that would not have shown Isaac anything. 5. Causing unecessary pain is immoral. As per your sense of morality. 6. Therefore, 1 is false (due to 3 + 4 + 5) There is no truth in morality; only opinion. 7. Therefore, 'God', as he is claimed to be, is not true (due to 6) 6 is invalid; 7, relying on the validity of the invalidated 6, is therefore also invalid.	Ah, I think Ben got ya there- [Do to others as you would have done to yourself] Do you think causing unnecessary pain (like God did) to others is fun to do to yourself? Don't tell me.

Wrong. The sin of Sodom was not homosexuality. Ezekiel 16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.	"They were haughty and did detestable things before me..."" The Hebrew word translated ""detestable"" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an ""abomination."" Similarly, Jude 7 declares, ""...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion."" So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.

Well, the contract isn't as important or needed because in most cases, since most theme parks are privately owned, they have an interest in operating as a theme park because people are willing to pay for entertainment instead of destroying it for office buildings, and the same goes for city, state and national parks. If the company has a vested interest in retaining the park without a contract, then it will stay as a park because there are always people who are willing to pay a fee to go into a park. Therefore, what is the difference between a theme park and leisure park?	I went to King's Dominion a few days ago...It costs $35 to get in and a bottled water is $3.75, that's outrageous. That will surely take the leisure out of the equation. When someone decides to take their children to small park in the city, they don't expect to pay crazy prices so some hotshot gets richer.	0

In Brazilian schools there is not a specific subject about sex education. Still, in the humdrum events of daily life, children can watch spicy scenes in a soap-opera, a movie and even in the streets, or see a magazine picture. These situations may obviously provoke a natural curiosity in the children about sex. If there were sex education classes in school, then all the students would get enough information to learn everything they should know about it, so they can have a good and healthy sex life later, when they are ready to. In fact, most parents do not feel comfortable to talk about sex with their children, and neither do the children. The teenagers usually get information only with friends, which is not something reasonable, since they probably rely on what they learnt from television programs, websites and web blogs that are not always reliable. Even if a father or a mother feels open to talk to their son or daughter about sex, they may not have enough recent information about sex or anything related to it. After all, we always have something to learn. For this reason it is necessary to have a well-trained professional who knows how to approach this theme to teenagers and also to their parents, because it is also important to them, since they probably still have doubts. This way, they would know that this subject should be faced seriously and if they can trust the teacher and the school. It might be surprising that in the 21st century students may only get information about sex in Biology or Science classes. It is certainly not enough, since these subjects will not discuss everything related to sex. They usually focus on life matters such as “a baby is made through sexual intercourse between a man and a woman” and teaches about prevention, telling that “AIDS, HPV and syphilis are sexually transmitted diseases, so that is why it is important to always use a condom”. A sex education class would treat and discuss themes like early pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptive methods, menstrual cycle, masturbation, male and female reproductive systems and phases of the human development and of pregnancy. Besides, it is very important for the teacher of this subject to be prepared to deal with possible psychological issues some children may have – such as repression or sex abuse history –, and also the teacher needs to develop discussions about relationships, feelings, emotions and sexual orientation. Some Biology teachers may not be capable of doing this. In countries such as United States or Canada, sex education programs have been in their syllabuses for decades. It is high time Brazil developed special classes to promote a healthy sex education to its youth. Joyce2E & Daniella2E	I think this kind of issue at school it is a little bit awkward, since it must be discuss at home, with family, for some reasons: one, in Brazil there is no professionals qualify to teach this to the students and this requires that the Government spend more money and qualification for those professionals; two, the sex life of any person have to be private and this class could expose the children and teenagers, making them unconfortable with the school envirenment.  Furthermore, this issue could stimulate the premature sex life.	0
"Iron man is reckless and would not make a good president. Whereas batman has a strong sense of patriotism, has strong moral principles, and understands the economy. He is also very cultural, and clearly the smarter of the two. Moreover, he is very diplomatic and has a small ego, which is important when serving a country and not yourself. Consider these actual Batman quotes: Dick Grayson: ""What's so important about Chopin?"" Bruce Wayne: ""All music is important, Dick. It's the universal language. One of our best hopes for the eventual realization of the brotherhood of man.""  Batman: ""Better put 5 cents in the meter."" Robin: ""No policeman's going to give the Batmobile a ticket."" Batman: ""This money goes to building better roads. We all must do our part."" Batman: ""Human mechanisms are made by human hands, Robin. None of them is infallible. It is a lesson that must be faced."" Batman: ""Nobody wants war."" Robin: ""Gee, Batman. Belgravia's such a small country. We'd beat them in a few hours."" Batman: ""Yes, and then we'd have to support them for years."" - Now Ironman quotes:  - Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got.

"While it is just a theory Theory by laymans terms, and theory by scientific terms are two different things. By laymans terms gravity is a fact and not just a theory, by scientific terms, gravity is both a theory and a proven fact. In scientific terms, a theory is merely an explanation to some thing, the theory of evolution explains something about the diversity of life.  Its hard to say however whether I believe in evolution or not Evolution doesn't have to contradict your belief in god, I understand that you are defending evolution which I applaud you for as you are defending education. However, I must also defend the validity of evolution, and I do have to say being indecisive about whether or not you buy into evolution, is almost as nonsensical as being indecisive on whether or not you buy into gravity. Evolution is one of the most proven scientific theories out there, probably right next to the theory of gravity, there is roughly as much evidence for evolution as there is for gravity in this day and age.  because alot of non-theists belive in it A lot of rational, educated, and realistic people ""believe"" in it. There is as many Christians and theists that acknowledge evolution as the truth it is as atheists and non-theists. Evolution doesn't have to contradict Christianity or any belief in god, what I have found in the world of theists when science confronts them is there are two kinds. Those whom accommodate their belief in god to their perception of reality, those whom accommodate their perception of reality to their belief in god. The latter is more damaging to humanity as a whole as well as the individual. I don't want to come off as hostile, I really don't. However I have to say being on the fence about evolution is like being on the fence on whether or not gravity is real. Gravity doesn't contradict god because we can't deny gravity, our god (as in the god of most people) created gravity, is responsible for gravity, why can't it be the same for evolution? A lot of Christians whom accept evolution think of it like that."	1:Hmm I see what you mean. 2.I believe its a mix of both creationism and evolution.	0

Puerto Rico is very proud of its Spanish language and culture.Although the island is bilingual, the language of the government, public schools, courts and 80 - 90% of the residents of Puerto Rico is Spanish and around 90% of Puerto Rico's high school graduates do not speak English well. There is a bill that was sent to Congress in 2006. Though the bill has not yet been passed, officials may still again attempt to make English the official language of the United States of America. If this bill and the creation of Puerto Rico as a state were both passed we would be forcing the 4 million new citizens to learn a completely new language.	I think this is a reasonable response, but fortunatly statistics say that in the near future (somewhere between now and 2012) that the main language in several states is going to be Spaglish, so they won't have to force them to learn a completely new laguage. Isn't the reason we have Spanish class is so that we can learn to speak spanish?	0

So, if this mute girl squirms resists or runs away, you would conclude that she was not open to a sexual relationship? same as the dog. I would not agree on letting the man have sex with the girl, since it could end up in rape. Of course, a human girl could make clear signs without using any form of language, that she is not into having sex. But the dog can easily be forced to have sex, which would result that the dog would end up being raped. And also if the owner molested the dog several times and hit him and stuff like that, the dog would probably be quiet in fear of being hit. Understand me? And seriously.. you can't ask for anybody to have sex in front of you to prove love. That is ridiculous.	"""And seriously.. you can't ask for anybody to have sex in front of you to prove love. That is ridiculous."" I wasn't asking, this was your idea. ""Let's say we have a mute girl, who can't write or communicate via. hand language or whatever that's called."" I was just trying to satisfy the burden of proof to you, extrapolating from your example. If you go back and read my last post carefully, i said she was freely able to stop the ATTEMPT at sexual intercourse which you called for so a being could demonstrate a willingness to have sex without being able to communicate verbally.  As to the bit about the dog easily being forced to have sex, i already addressed that in my previous post, where i said is was gonna cut off your next argument. to elaborate just a bit on ""if the owner molested the dog several times and hit him..."" all these things can be done to smaller people by larger people, like my previous point about human to human rape. Some people are terrible, horrific people, i can't dispute this. It is fairly clear when a dog is doing what you want it to because it is afraid of you and when a dog is doing something you want because it loves you and wants to do whatever it is.  I think I have stated my argument as clearly as I can; if I didn't convince you, or if you won't allow yourself to be convinced that's cool. If by chance, you think i was unclear on any of my points, I'm happy to continue this topic. Otherwise i think we are at an impasse and will very shortly, if not already are, going to be going in circles. I thank you for listening to my arguments and considering them based on their logical merit. If you have any other topics you would care to debate with me; i would be happy to let you propose a topic and pick a side and i will take the opposition.

Since more and more people starting to prefer eating out rather than dealing with the hustle of home cooking, the restaurant industry is booming and they can afford to bring the prices much lower.   Also, most workers realize that since their salary depend on the number of hours they work, so they much rather work and earn more money than spend time on cooking. Since they make more money working they can afford to eat in any restaurant they want.	the next significant reason not to eat out is that service in restaurants is not always good. All the waiters are usual people; they may think about their own problems and just forget to serve you, or rude, that might spoil the mood for all day. Unfortunately, visitors to the restaurant cannot control the conditions under which meal is cooked, if there is enough clean, whether waiter spits in your soup or not))   In addition meal in a restaurant may be too oily, too spicy, salty, or may contain ingredients that you are contraindicated. For example, having diseases such as diabetes, people should follow special diets. At home there's opportunity to regulate and balance the food, it can be prepared with less salt and fat than restaurant food.	0
Sometimes it is better to live life without certain feelings, I believe that drugs give a person instant gratification as it influences the brain to illusions of pleasure, but in reality it damages the body. If people become addicted to these sorts of stimulants then they would eventually regret it. Isn't it our duty in society to protect people from feeling these sort of things? It's like that a person who was a victim of rape would be fearful and distrust people for the rest of their life. They would probably see less value in having sex as it has been used as a form of violation and oppression on them.	Isn't it our duty in society to protect people from feeling these sort of things? No. It's not our duty, or our right to tell others what chemicals they are allowed to put into their body. You have a right to your body. That's also why there should be laws against people running around raping each other. But, this has derailed from the subject of the debate. We all know that marijuana is a wonder drug and it's cousin hemp is an amazingly strong and useful commodity.

I think Yes....after all everything you see has nature and god in it. Does this include Aids?	Does it also include death? Pain? No. The theory goes that God created a perfect world, without pain, suffering, or Aids. When Adam and Eve (or, more accurately, Eve and Adam) sinned, such things came into the world. The idea is that when sin entered, we as humans (the caretakers of the Earth, according to Genesis) pushed God away from it all. Nature has since been slowly degrading, and the imperfections are causing our suffering.	0

This is of course something I would enjoy being drawn out on, so, if you please, keep my feet to the flames if you find my responses unsatisfactory. I would consider it a great favor if you helped me identify a flaw in my ideology. Now my position is that while we may fail to recognize opportunity to stop someone from causing harm, without ourselves causing harm, this is more due to lack of concern than lack of opportunity. If you are being attacked, you have to asses both the intent and capability of your attacker to injure or kill you. To Illustrate, imagine an out of control kid, flailing punches at you. It should be easy for you to imagine more graceful and elegant ways to deal with this kind of attack than say..trying to gouge the kids eyes out. It is when we DON'T have enough confidence in our skills that we tend to resort to desperate measures. I think we may find a purely semantic disagreement between us about the nature of violence, but I welcome exploring that if you want to. Regarding the alternatives you'd like me to explain.....present me with a reasonably detailed realistic scenario	0
The government doesn't give a rats ass about religion. We have separation of church and state. Homosexuality was illegal because the government wanted to promote procreation in order to maintain the fertility rate. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalfertilityrate ;)	In Britain It used to. Before we had separation of church and state homosexuality was illegal.	0
What do you mean have a permanent career? Like a civilian job? Dude, I am foreign. I really don't know everything about America's military. I just know it is known as a permanent army and is a career field option.  I am aware of the fact that many countries have standing armies, but that is not a valid argument for whether or not they are good.  I was just using that to stress the fact that many countries want the best army they can get and a standing army is best for that because its constant training for combat or any situation they may encounter.   Many people smoke, that does not make it good. I don't know. Does it? Are you aware of what the Swiss system is? Well dude, I don't. I am not American or Swiss so I wouldn't know.	"In Switzerland, there is no standing army. Instead they have a peoples militia. Every suitable male over the age of 18 is required to serve in the military. They receive an initial basic training and are later required to attend a yearly refresher course.  Each member is required, by law, to own and manage government issued weapons specific to the job that person was assigned. Until 2007 they were required to keep ammunition for said weapons as well.  The reason this structure works is because the Swiss army does not take part in armed conflicts in other countries, no ""if""s ""and""s or ""but""s."	0
"As stated, while you can use evil as an example as to why MAYBE God is not omni-all-that-shit, it is not ""a coherent argument against the existence of God(s)""."	I agree that it's not an argument against the existence of God by every definition that religious people have come up with (it'd be an extraordinary argument if it managed to cover such a wide base). But it is an argument against a God who is defined as an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being. Since this is a definition that a significant number of religious people accept, it's a genuine anti-God argument. It's just not anti-every-concept-of-God.	0

There's no religious reason not to.  	"A ""religious reason"" is an inherent oxymoron, as you will never encounter a rational explanation for anything pertaining to religion. What passes as a reason in the religious context is nothing more than simple personal belief. The only religious reason necessary to warrant protection is the existence of a belief against homosexuality. In the U.S. at least, as I believe it should be anywhere, people should be allowed their freedom of religion and that extends to this case as well I think."	0
Even though Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States and has a non-voting delegate in the U.S. house, it does not have any voting members in Congress or have the right to participate in presidential elections.Puerto Rico may not pay income tax but still pays certain federal tax's. The United States already treats it as a state and regulates certain parts of their lives however without the benefits of actually being a state.	Though they may be treated like a state in some cases, they aren't yet and most likely want to keep it that way for now at least. This is why they have voted three times to stay the way they are and not join the states. Be it political reasons or social, they don't desire to be a state and gain the benefits of the states. Personally I think that what we consider benefits could be bad for them. They may use the same currency as we do, but the amount that they pay and charge for items is exceedingly different than that of the United States. We may around twenty to thirty dollars on water bills and they pay less than ten in some cases. Although they may be close to statehood, the differences could cause economic issues for Puerto Rico and maybe even the states.	0
Unabridged freedom of speech is how its written in the constitution, if you don't get that shows how much the constitution means. If unabridged freedom of speech can be interpreted in a way that restricts your freedom of speech then freedom of religion can be interpreted to include Atheism	In theory sure. But the freedom of speech thing is only the way it is because it had been shown that allowing people to say anything they wanted could be potentially dangerous and that the right was not absolute. You would have to make a similar case for freedom of religion. And as of yet I don't think any one has made that point to the proper authority's I have heard such reasons but its not up to me what it means so it doesn't make much of a difference if I have or not.	0

"The influence for absolute monarchs was fine. For example. King Louis XIV set the ""divine right of kings"" and his influence made religious people fall under his reign and he reign for at least 70+ years. The people never over threw him. The had more power and they had a much more positive connotation than a dictator. If either have a bad influence they both go down. If they have a good influence they remain."	Nice choice, yes Louis XIV did well enough ( if you're not a poor person, and don't mind completely and totally insane monarchs) but not unless one day they descendants go a step too far, and the entire country decides to cut their heads off all nobility and one day have a far better off country than before.	0

"Pyg, the portrayals of women that you refer to don't make you ""love"" them. They just make you want to screw them. In your words: ""dude, check out Megan Fox on the cover of Cosmopolitan, I'd so bang her"". I think you've given us a clear example of what media representations of women do to the male mind, thanks. Are media portrayals of the genders sexist? Oh hells yeah. Especially when it comes to women? Oh hells yeah.  Look at, for example: - The number of women who are screaming about nothing (bleach, rodents, I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter) in advertising as a return to images of women as ""hysterics"" - The number of women in magazines and print ads who are looking at the men in the picture versus looking at the camera - The number of photos of women that show them as body parts (just boobs, just legs, just an ass) instead of as people - The never-ending parade of slutwear worn by every female celebrity from Miley Cyrus to Helen Mirren - The increasing sexualization of female youth and the de-sexualization of female adulthood and aging  - The use of images of violence or degradation of women to sell products Do the models get paid? Sure. Do they control the imagery? No. So whether or not they get paid is rather beside the point. Nobody is arguing that, say, the Olsen twins have personally been victimized by dressing slutty on TV -- but women as a class are routinely degraded by media imagery which presents women as primarily as stereotypes. ""Fortunate and smart,"" Spooner? Because they feed into stereotypes that are ultimately harmful to women? If 99% of the portrayals of the male gender were dudes who looked like Al Bundy scratching his balls and mowing the lawn, would you say those were the ""fortunate and smart"" men because they catered to female needs -- or would the ""fortunate and smart"" men still be guys like Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump, who succeeded at the goals they set for themselves instead of by splashing a photo on the cover of People of themselves looking like a stereotype?"	"By your own argument, men are just as victimized as women in the media. Look at the sitcoms. King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, etc. They all show the men as dumb, lazy, sports-watching goofballs who need their wives to keep them in line.   So stop with the ""females are the only victim"" stuff. Men are portrayed in just as bad, if not worse, stereotypes in the media."	0
my dear. Atheists are atheists because their knowledge is less real. They dont understand the real world. Of course many of them are good people.  I have seen many people who say that their is no hell and no paradise. They say that after dying we will not be resurrected. and they go on criticizing all the religion as long as they dont understand the real Islam.  I am asking you, do people have any proof or science says that it is impossible for bodies for reformed? Haven't they seen that water takes the same shape after getting evaporated.  leaves get disintegrated in the soil and again new leaves come on the land.  i dont think that any atheist can scientifically or logically prove that reformation of body is impossible. Science does not say that it is impossible. So i hope when atheists are about to die they must remember their reality. How they came to this world and where are they going to.

"In a purely logical debate, it's rubbish to try to say ""why would God allow evil to happen?"" First of all, ya morons, if we were debating on God's existence, we would have to accept that if he did exist, we would NOT understand his true intentions. We're human beings that are limited by the physical realm. God is supposed to be supernatural and powerful and shit. So saying ""if God does exist, he's an asshole for letting evil happen"" is admitting that you're an ignorant fool who isn't serious about reasoning. The same goes for ""what created God"" arguments.

"To me the heaven and hell thing makes more sense. The entire rebirth is actually you trying to achieve some kind of ""nirvana"" or something like that but its just nonexistence (release from the suffering of this world). But if the soul lives forever why would it cease to exist? And the entire hell thing I agree is harsh, but for a reason. Hell isn't full of people who don't know about God or things like that, its full of people who have rejected God and continually do so."	This version of heaven and hell seems silly. Rejecting God should not be a reason to go to hell. God created a bunch of rules to follow that are actually productive, like don't kill people, etc. But, if someone follows all of the rules, but does not think God is important will be punished, and the person who accepts God, but keeps breaking the rules and asks for forgiveness will be praised?

To say ""Well, i'm not so sure"" is bullshit. There are some certainties in this world, and there are other such things not to certain in this world.  Figuring out which is real to you or not is key.  Figuring out which is real to mankind is key Key meaning the dilemma, the issue, the conflict. It's pretty obvious that no man knows for certain everything this have has to offer.  HOWEVER, there are many certainties existent. Anyone who says otherwise considers themselves to be not alive and existent, and in that case, how can you have an opinion if you're not real?"	Exactly how can you have thoughts if you don't exist. How do you know you have thoughts, have you ever seen them, has your friend. Can either of you two prove it. If I cut you how will I know you felt that. You feeling it is nothing to me because i can't feel your pain or alleged emotions.

Please supply proof because everything I have read says that Marijuana is illegal full stop, to grow a plant without THC you need to start with seeds that contains THC which is illegal it's once the plant is growing that you genetically modify it to removeve the THC.  My logic works on the basis that the war on drugs as it is is not working so legalise Pot as it has proven medicinal use and is less harmful than stuff thats already legal then concentrate on the dangerous drugs. It'll take money out of the drug dealers pockets, free up space in overcrowded prisons and money from Police budgets that can then be used to combat stuff that poses a real threat like Heroin and Crack. Why do you call it a danger drug, no-one has died from a Pot overdose and contrary to what people would have you believe it is not a gateway drug.	Industrial hemp it is THC free (less than 0.2% of THC, limit set by law). I've grew up near a huge field of that. Dealers would not disappear , their numbers would increase, dealers would be always cheaper (no taxes at all) and after legalization, possession would not be crime anymore so there will be no way how to get rid of dealers. Also for example Taliban is the biggest producer of Marijuana on the world, would you like to legalize their income? Medical use of Marijuana... it's a mild painkiller, nothing special also nothing healthy, no need for it.	0
I agree that anything goes... as long as it isn't torture. What was shown in the video was very human very natural, and since the horse had no place it could live in society, and i'm assuming the guy couldn't keep it anymore, that was perfectly fair. As for all of these people that choose the vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, I don't see very much reason why. We're humans we have advancements that allow us to surpass lower animals. You wouldn't blame a frog for using it's tongue to ketch flies, you wouldn't blame a spider for using webbing to catch insects, and I hope you wouldn't blame an ape for using a stick to capture ants. It's the circle of life, so long as no one has to suffer.	Clearly no place? There's loads of horse sanctuaries, such as the Starlight Sanctuary in America, or Penny Farm in Britain. And you're comparing insects, for some reason, to animals. Why?	0
Your debate is invalid because you assume there are only two choices: gold based money, or Government printed currency. I believe gold is inferior...we shouldn't use gold, what we should use is a commodity system.  I doubt Gold would win in a commodity based system...over the years gold has been going up & up, while production has failed to keep up. A commodity that would be better, and more likely to be used in a commodity based system, would be silver.  I believe, without a doubt, we should use a commodity based system, because a fiat system lets the Government print excess money to stimulate the economy...I'm not going to dispute the ability of stimulas to produce economic growth...but all the growth it produces is temporary. Temporary growth in exchange for lost savings and debt is just stupid.	Your debate is invalid because you assume there are only two choices: gold based money, or Government printed currency.

Wrong I dont like Elvis so I reckon he is dead just like they say - the moon however is a different thing altogether - I watched it live hours of TV and scietific explanation. Just about every one with a telescope power full enough watched it - we tracked it in the UK and the Russians tracked and they would have been the first to say you didnt go there but funny they didnt say that	"The following is an argument I made a long time ago in regards to the moon landing. It covers the majority of the conspiracy theories, and should clear up any doubts you have: ""Ugh, is this really a debate? Whatever, instead of explaining why I know it did happen, I think I'll just debunk some myths about the moon landing. Why is the flag blowing in the wind? This must mean they were in a studio! Nope. Watch the video... THE FLAG IS NOT FUCKING BLOWING! It only moves when one of the astronauts moves it. Seeing as there is no friction in space, it continues to move, because there's nothing to stop it moving. Otherwise, it is completely still. Where is the blast crater? It must be fake if there's no blast crater. Think of this like a harrier jet. When a Harrier lands, does it: A.) Leave a giant frickin' hole in the ground. Or is it B.) Blow the top fines, such as sand and dust, into the air, and land safely. If you said B, give yourself a round of applause! If you said A, please don't ever comment on the lunar landings again. To summarise, there's no crater because there was not enough downwards force to create one, instead, it blew the top fines away. The photos are too high quality. Bullshit. NASA took dozens of poor quality photos, why publish all of them? The spaceship couldn't have survived radiation from the Van Allen belt. It did. Alumimium hulls protected the astronauts from lethal radiation. In fact, 39 of the former Apollo astronauts have developed cataracts, as a side effect of the low level radiation. The footprints are too well preserved. Moon dust is stickier than sand. This allows it to stick together in a vacuum. There's your answer. Well, I think I got most of the major ones.

Really? What are your normal opinions? That sounds pretty elitist to me. Mercy killing is killing out of mercy. Although, since it's a fetus, it's not really killing. Fetuses aren't even human. And I don't have a mental disorder. Misanthropy and self-loathing are just feelings. They're not disorders.

It's not elitist, it's smart. The masses decide, so it's good to understand them. A Mercy Killing assumes that those killed would be better off dead.

Having to love that which you fear? The essence of sadomasochism, in my eyes.	"I might not be right because this is Islamic but maybe its the same. We believe that you should fear God in a good way.

So maybe its the same with Christianity. Besides isn't sadomasochism enjoy receiving and giving pain?

Patriotism is one of the most retarded and childish ideas that still manages to permeate popular culture as a perceived virtue, even though it is a baseless and undeserved pride derived from the fallacy that being born within the same imaginary borders makes two people's individual achievements somehow shared, despite no mutual involvement from either party.	What a stupid load of crap. Downvote for you!	0
"""They strived to survive, like us""...  Exactly.  We can go all night to determine if animals were put here on earth for us, or if humans were ""put"" here to be the top species, the be the top of the food chain.  As you say, we're all (animals included) are in this universe to survive, to thrive, that's a purpose. And so, for a human to kill another animal for food, shelter and comfort is hardly cruel. It's natural.  Human to human is a completely different ball game.  It's obviously blurred to you, however to me it's not blurred. A human killing another human is wrong. A human killing another animal is fine. An animal killing another animal is fine. Do you see this?"	Humans are animals. Killing without need is always wrong. He did not need to kill that horse. We do not need to kill to eat meat, with our modern knowledge and technologies. If I was being attacked, human or non-human, there would be no qualms about killing for survival. I don't see how you don't understand. We are dominant over, not only other species, but other people. How is it completely different? I guess they said that about slavery.	0
in which case shouldnt civil partnership suffice what is marriage but just a label associated with churches? i understand there are some legal differences but fuck gettin married anyway	in which case shouldnt civil partnership suffice That's one of the arguments that was raised when people proposed separate but equal facilities for black people. Yet we know, from history, how well that turned out. It'd be okay, if the 'equal' portion could really be upheld, yet it rarely is. what is marriage but just a label associated with churches? You know, you are so correct. Yet why are marriages, something associated with religion, enforced and ruled over by law. Maybe people should just be able to get married willy nilly, no matter whether they like each other or not, no matter whether they can support each other or not, so long as they meet the church's requirements. Seeing as this isn't the case, and law protects, and governs marriage, gay people who are also protected and governed by law, should be included. i understand there are some legal differences but fuck gettin married anyway I actually agree with you here. The whole 'married' label should just be erased. People should just be bonded if they absolutely need to get to gether, but when things get labeled, things get heated.	0

I can see where that connection might be made, but I can't say I agree. Christians understand the aspect of love and fear and still choose to have faith in God - they're not forced to.

Well, I own a new testament (only the new) book myself. So I am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. What I am saying, and what Random Dude seem to not get, is that christianity is BASED on the new testament. We believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? A christian is a person who believes in Jesus - Jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. So that is why christianity is BASED (remember the word based) on the Gospels.	I should have been more clear; I've seen only New/Old Testement books printed, but I've never seen a Christian church use exclusively one or the other. Actually that's basically what I said, but whatever.  Christianity might be based on the word of Christ (personally I think it's an insult to his message and diametrically opposed to everything he stood for, but, again, whatever), but the word of Christ in the NT is baseless and doesn't make a whole lot of sense without the OT. Jesus came to Earth and died for the sins of humanity as detailed in Genesis, for example; without Genesis to set the stage for why he needed to come and die the crucifixion is a pointless gesture. Christianity might not exist without the NT, but the NT couldn't exist without the OT, so in that sense Christianity wouldn't exist without the OT, or, at least, it would make absolutely no sense (more so than it does now, anyways). So Christianity is based (yes, I remembered the word) on both books of the Bible; you can't have one without the other.  And this is all theoretical; in practice the religion of Christianity is clearly based on both books.	0
"That is true but you're missing the whole point let me clarify through an example. Quocalimar, what is a picnic table? Some would reply, "" A) oh, it's wood has screws."" others would say, "" B) A surface that holds items and allowing you to sit at the same time."" So to your logic we can test it go sit on it and then find out that it was true but, that's not what a picnic table is. My response to statement A is, "" So does a door, that's not what a picnic table is."" and my response to B is, "" You can also sit on a desk while it holds items."" that's not what it ""is,"" we assume that it consists of certain properties by describing it with the same characteristics as many things. So i disagree with your opinion."

Science is man made because science is simply studying and observing things around us empirically, which is basically taking detailed notes. Epistemology is the study of how knowledge is obtained, and our science is just one way, our science just makes sense, but it doesn't mean it is a absolute.	"I wasn't calling into question whether or not science is man made. I am just asking...assuming that it is... how one can with certainty conclude FROM THAT that it is IMPOSSIBLE to know anything with ""absolution”. You say: Epistemology is the study of how knowledge is obtained, and our science is just one way, our science just makes sense, but it doesn't mean it is a absolute. I believe that's true, but neither does it mean that knowledge obtained by humans can never be “absolute”. If my belief that I am typing a response right now is justified and true, than it qualifies as true knowledge. It appears that you are asserting that the reason knowledge cannot be absolute is because it's man made, and I don't see how knowledge being man made makes it impossible for any knowledge to be ""absolute"". I think at this point you should define what you mean by absolute."	0
Good dolphin! :D	youre an idiot that is all	0
Overall, I'll say no, but this really depends on the severity of the incident of cheating as well as the length of the cheating and how long ago it occured. Take this as an example: Bobby first cheated on Cindy two weeks ago with three women for around seven days. That's seven days of mistrust multiplied by three women, all reasons why that man would probably never be trusted again. The relationship should probably be drawn to a close. Now, look at this next example: Let's say that Bobby never actually cheated on Cindy, but Cindy first cheated on Bobby ten years ago with one man for six months, and then another man for eighteen months. It was a long time ago, but it was for a longer period of time than the example given where Bobby cheated. It was also with less partners than the original example, but for longer periods of time, equalling twenty-four months or two years. The act was still wrong and should therefore be heavily discussed between the two. If the problem cannot be solved or overcome then again, the relationship should probably end.  If my partner were to cheat on me in either case, I would probably disband the relationship or look to build a solution that suits the situation. In the overall choice, I would probably stop the relationship, because I believe that a relationship is built on love, trust and partnership. If any of these were to be violated, then the relationship would be pointless to me.	"What about open relationships?  You say that it's all about love, trust and all that jazz, so if your partner openly relates with other people, never lies about it so there's no trust issue, and loves you very much at the same time. So in many ways it's not called ""cheating"", but just one time they ""fail to report"" a relationship and you found out... what then?"	0

Your comparisons are ridiculous. A haircut? Growing up? Come on! None of that is like getting your gender changed. Do you think parents want to see their child who they raised and have fond memories of, swap genders? A gender change operation is extremely selfish in my opinion. Like I said earlier, society now accepts gays and lesbians... why do they have to swap genders? To fool a straight man or woman? Make them think that you're something you're not? It's living a lie.	How is a getting a haircut not the same as changing your gender? Haircut makes you look different with that people perceive you differently. Gender change makes you look different and perceived differently.  Your hair before you decide you cut it is from when you were born (the genetics that determine how long it will get). Your gender is determined by genetics as well. Maybe parents have fond memories of their child when their hair was short but not when it was long?  Maybe parents have fond memories when their child was a nice bookworm not when they were a rockband enthusiast? people change because they feel like it and/or the situation around them makes them change. If parents can not accept the fact that people change and 'grow up' then they should not be parents should they?	0

Yes if they want to last another 100 years, religions need to change with the times just as they did when they started to disapprove slavery, all things have to adapts to survive that's the natural order of things, social issues are no different.

Well if the bible pushers want to use the bible to support their evidence I think it's good sound advice to point out how the bible shows they are actually wrong.

"It wouldn't be hypocritical for ""Bible Pushers"" to use science to prove science wrong, because they don't consider science to be a work of fiction.

a·the·ism  /ˈāTHēˌizəm/ Noun The theory or belief that God does not exist. Hence, if I believe Cronos created the world, and god is something the whiteman created, then I am an Atheist.	"Why aren't you getting it? Chronos is a god, google his name, it will say the Roman god or deity of whatever. Deities are what makes a person theist. Belief in the existence of a god or gods, esp. belief in one god as creator of the universe, intervening in it and sustaining a persona God or 'gods', why would 'gods' be describing the Christian deity? They aren't simply describing the Christian deity they are describing deities in general. A god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion): ""a deity of ancient Greece That is the definition of Deity. If you wan to use definitions like I originally tried to neglect, Chronos, the Roman deity of time is by definition a god. Whom if you believe in makes you a theist."	0
No I didn't know that horse but that doesn't mean I should not feel sympathy for him. I don't know Jamie Bolger but I still feel great sympathy for him and his family. What I find worse about this is that if this was a human the world would probably go crazy about it and say how sick this person was but because its a horse no one really cares and I feel that animals also deserve the care that a human would.  I find the taping disrespectful I would hate for my death to be taped and put on YouTube for some snide point to prove.	"Life deserves respect.  Plants and Insects deserve respect.  Animals deserve respect. Humans are animals.  Humans deserve respect. Humans are different than other animals.  And so, life: insects, animals, humans deserve respect.  If this was a video of a human being murdering another, OF COURSE itd be a different situation and scenario.  HOWEVER, to put yourself as a human to a species and being that is not you and is X, Y, Z. It's up to you. And so to further say ""If a human were to kill a human, IMAGINE the difference."" The difference is precisely my point, in that there is a difference and many people claim there is not.  Of course animals, other than human, deserve respect. An animal, a part from humane, is not creating nuclear bombs, or murdering, or giving flowers, or being kind, ECT both ways. Respect to the horse that does not create destruction. Respect to the frog that captures its prey with its tongue. Respect to the cheetah that captures its prey. Respect to the Lion that intimidates/ Do you follow?  Taping is one thing, obviously that person was/is trying to make a point....in whichever way.  I would not want my death to be put on youtube for the world to see, however I do not have a say in the manner nor matter.

According to biology as it's popularly understood. But I can't see anything incorrect about thinking that I live on through those I influence. Can you?

specialization is what allows for a community to function; diversity of skills, jobs, etc are essential to a community.  Totalitarian states tend to fall apart for a reason, the inability to express various philosophies which various groups in the state tend to hold creates resentment against the state, it also allows for faults of one philosophy to not be countered by others.	Having different jobs in a community is not equivalent to ideological diversity. Different professions are necessary for society, but ideological diversity is not. Any diversity in ideology is directly antagonistic to state values. Differences in profession are not opposed to each other in that way, so it's not a factor. Totalitarian states tend to collapse for economic reasons, not ideological reasons. The greatest strength of totalitarian states is their ideological unity.	0
You are right regarding legal rights, but natural rights are pretty much universal due to their very nature(no pun intended). When individuals are concerned with their own well-being you see a consistent trend towards the acceptance of values such as life, property, and personal pleasure. Rights are societies' way of implementing these values in a social context.	Even natural rights do not exist. However the argument becomes problematic when property has no meaning in the case of most nomadic tribes or certain religious groups such as Buddhist monks. And in the latter personal pleasure is denied from their lifestyle.	0

States were stepping on civil liberties. The states were allowed to whatever they wanted so long as it didn't contradict with the bill of rights. The rights of the people come before administrative protocol. So you believe starting the bloodiest war in American history over something that could have been solved legally? Seriously, at this time, some states were already abolishing slavery and any state admitted to the union would vote as to if it would be free or slave. If we had waited a bit longer and tryed to actually solve the issue logically, maybe hundreds of thousands of people wouldn't have died in a war that ended in extremely harsh feelings between the South, North and former slaves. This way of thinking is what caused the worst war in American history, slavery didn't cause it, America's idiotic idea of dealing with it did.	Could it have been solved legally?

If you and your girlfriend had the evil lust thing and had sex and you both are happy then that is wrong because 1. Your suppose to have sex when your married.(That is my opinion.) 2.

Thanks Emperor for supporting me!  	"However, I am only defending THAT argument. The truth is that Jesus NEVER spoke about homosexuality, and if anything, supported it, when speaking of eunuchs.  You are WRONG to think that homosexuality is wrong because of what Jesus DID NOT say.

Anyone can say ""God said that Srom has a tiny willy"". Is it true? Maybe. Maybe not. If you try to say God DID NOT say that, I would say that you are not listening properly, you are close minded and arrogant to assume that God speaks to you and you alone. However, the truth is that a god did NOT speak to me, but if a person does not know that, they might be TRICKED into thinking that you have a tiny willy, when the truth is the opposite!!

"They were haughty and did detestable things before me..."" The Hebrew word translated ""detestable"" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an ""abomination."" Similarly, Jude 7 declares, ""...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion."" So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.

That doesnt mean that your little brother may grow up not being smart. He will grow up just fine.	Most parents find the TV as a babysitter for their children and I think this is wrong. TV is OK in moderation, but children should be getting the physical activity that they need. Many children and adults are fat because all they do is eat and sit in front of the TV. There should be a switch on televisions that says when you have watched enough for the day and it shuts off. Most people don't have the will power to turn it off and go outside to participate in a physical activity.	0

Dude. You are missing what I am saying.  But then again historians wrote the same things so the bible isnt a secret exclusive inside look at their beliefs I would argue that it is I mean the entire thing says it all. It is stuffed with guys who believed in God. I would say it is a major inside look are the belief system of that specific era.  And we were talking about how people lived at the time, not only what they believed but their culture, daily lives, agriculture, relations, conflicts, ect. Conflicts? The bible talks about that. Daily lives? It does touch on that. Culture? Majorly touched on that. Agriculture? I have no clue. Relations? Like relationships? I think it speaks of that and addresses some problems.  Historians jobs were to write down factual unbiased report-like accounts of their times which are far more trustworthy than a religious book that doesnt seek to be accurate or give a report of daily life but to propogate its belief set. So basically blah blah blah the bible is religious so it loses all accuracy. I don't believe it. They are writing down what they went through from there perspective. Thats it. Its what they go through. So if that person was religious then they went through some religious trials. Its still a trustworthy source to study the mindset and cultural differences between nations back in the day. After all it is supposed to snip bits of history and place it into itself. It doesn't have to be an exact day to day basis. It can just tell you what that person has experienced. A history book informs and so does a bible. If you are persuaded by it then thats on you.	"Conflicts? The bible talks about that. Its dates often contradict as well as the numbers of troops and usually has some supernatural thing tacked onto it. It isnt a trustworthy source for that kind of information especially compared to historians writings. Daily lives? It does touch on that. Yeah not really! The old testament doesnt really have anything describing the daily life of the average Jew and the new testament just follows jesus around. Again, historians reports are far better. Culture? Majorly touched on that Ill grant you this one, however i again need to mention that it isnt specific to the bible. The historians writings have culture in it too. Agriculture? I have no clue It doesnt really say more than ""Cain brought a sheep for slaughter"" so i guess it does say they raised sheep. but the historians actually have accounts of what crops are grown where and what livestock are raised, their farming techniques, and so on.  Relations? Like relationships? no like relations with other countries and nations. The bible doesnt really talk about government and politics at all and it often gets relations with other nations wrong. There were never any masses of jews in egypt for example. So another point for historians whos main bulk of the writing is about politics and government works. So basically blah blah blah the bible is religious so it loses all accuracy. No, its inaccuracy makes it lose all accuracy. When it stacks up to the facts it usually fails.  They are writing down what they went through from there perspective. Correction. Someone was writing down what they thought people said about people who may or may not have existed and what they may or may not have thought they saw or heard. And anyways THEIR perspective isnt really important when you gather that they believed in a space wizard who birthed a son that did magic tricks. They sort of lose credibility. Its still a trustworthy source to study the mindset and cultural differences between nations back in the day. Not compared to the accurate writings of historians as well as government records from nations. The spiritual ramblings of ancient jews in a holy book isnt a credible source even if it does get a couple things right. After all it is supposed to snip bits of history and place it into itself. We dont want snip bits. Snip bits of fact among non-facts are not credible when compared to almost completely factual accounts.  It doesn't have to be an exact day to day basis. It can just tell you what that person has experienced.  If we can A) prove that person actually wrote the book. and B) That what they saw or heard wasnt only what they THOUGHT they saw or heard. A history book informs and so does a bible. Yes but in different ways. Im talking about where it is best to go to get facts about a whole range of topics from a trustworthy source. That would be from historians. If you want some fact and culture mixed with deluded perspectives about unfactual happenings then the bible is your source. If you are persuaded by it then thats on you. I hope you dont mean that its my CHOICE whether it persuades me"	0
"I like how you decide to put only negative examples as what can take the place of God. Why not friends, family, love, empathy, or generosity? Do these require a belief in god? Are atheists incapable of these things? I can tell you that, as an atheist, I don't ""worship"" anything. There are certain qualities which I hold in high esteem, and those people which I care about, and even activities that I enjoy doing. None of these things I worship yet they are still a part of my life. I'm sorry but your simplistic view of people fails to take into account the complexity of life."	"I never said any of those things are negative, you did. It doesn't surprise me to have someone deem work as a negative, this is the going trend.

Athiest, agnostic, christian, tree, grass, desk, dvd, teleivison, the letter a, the number 1...all man made labels with man made definitions....but truth remains...with what knowledge are we born with? either godly or instinct or just blank....what would we become with no teachings of god at all?	We have instincts that drive us to the most profitable and pleasurable means. If there was an omnigod, how come we like things that are bad for us, like drugs and chocolate? Why would a deity program humans with an overwhlming motive to break deadly sins it states? We are our experiences, we 'watch and learn' and that makes us us, my fvt. theory anyway.	0
No, they are merely undecided on the existance of a god or gods. .	Well than they don't believe, if they are basing their ideology on evidence than they do not believe so agnostics are really just atheists with second thoughts.	0
Exactly if it can't be proven that it is real then you must automatically go to its not real.	We do not yet have a fully accepted theory to explain gravity, but we observe its effects and we know it is real.  The effects of emotions can be observed both externally and internally. Progress is being made in understanding the chemical reactions behind emotions. But even without knowledge of the chemical process, we would know emotions to be a real phenomenon. It's a given condition of the general human experience.	0

I have a suspicion that you cannot name a single piece of information released during a civilian trial that is helpful to terrorists. I would argue even if there is some, that issues like waterboarding, and our military tribunals have been far more useful as a recruitment tool to terrorists than any information which may be divulged in court. The fact is, our military strong-arm tactics make us look bad and creates more of the same problem we are trying to solve. The conviction rate is correct. Not a person named a terrorist has ever had less than life in a SuperMax prison - from which not a person in history has ever escaped. And many terrorists have been executed in civilian court. The two options offer the same results ultimately. These are the differences. 1. In a civilian court, people who are ultimately innocent, like the group of religious dissenters China sent to one of our military prisons, are released sooner and justice is better served. 2. Using civilian courts has just as high a prosecution rate, but cannot be used as a recruitment tool and does not draw the embarassment and ire of our long time allies like Spain, Canada, UK, France, etc. In fact, several of our allies have tried to, and in the case of Nigeria have, accused the Bush administration of war crimes because of our handling of terrorists. It is an embarassment, completely against the spirit of our country, and most of all, has not helped makes us safer - often in fact making us less safe.	Information on techniques used how to capture these terrorists exposed to the media? Military tribunals cannot be used as a recruitment because trials are isolated from the media and the terrorist is not protected by constitutional rights. This treatment that we are giving terrorists might be harsh but you need to understand that these are people stuck with what they believe in and will continue to strive for what they believe until we succumb to their desires and requests. How does the military makes us look bad because they treating terrorists like terrorists, the way they deserved to be treated. The reason why i say this, because they no feelings especially with the 9/11 bombing and various American Journalists who were executed on television. I was reading of a story recently in which a federal case involving a terrorists was tried in NY and had many of his charges broken down to less serious charges.	0

"Government are worse at some point. But government can be temporary, for about 10 or 50 or 100 years. But religion is different. the guide in the book is there as long as the religion lives and their Muhammad history is always seen as a ""Idol act"" by his followers. And there will be always among this followers follows what is guided in the book and what is done by their ""Idol"".  And this can go on forever. Proven by history, Muslim is the longest war mongering religion since their beginning. Part of their history is war and conquer and jihad to spread their belief. And it is forever that their book will claim to be the best religion of all, and want it to stand as ""the last man standing"". It is claimed in their book to make Islam ""stand""."	who's worse muslim extremists or governments in terms of mass killings? Government are worse at some point. This is is the only relevant thing you said to the debate. and you are even on the wrong side. But government can be temporary, for about 10 or 50 or 100 years.

"That is true but you're missing the whole point let me clarify through an example. Quocalimar, what is a picnic table? Some would reply, "" A) oh, it's wood has screws."" others would say, "" B) A surface that holds items and allowing you to sit at the same time."" So to your logic we can test it go sit on it and then find out that it was true but, that's not what a picnic table is. My response to statement A is, "" So does a door, that's not what a picnic table is."" and my response to B is, "" You can also sit on a desk while it holds items."" that's not what it ""is,"" we assume that it consists of certain properties by describing it with the same characteristics as many things. So i disagree with your opinion."	A picnic table is no definite thing. Anything can be referred to the picnic table.  in the area I live in the picnic tables are made of metal sometimes, but in Florida the picnic tables were often made of wood, as opposed to Japan and Asian countries where they simply take a picnic blanket out to the grassland.	0

I believe that God is imortal, he never ended or began. But you believe, that there is no God or anything. But in the end, there has to be SOMETHING that created everything. I mean, it can't be made by nothing. You believe its nothing, I believe it's God. God is the source I believe created everything. What is your source?	This isn't what I believe, but it's just as valid as what you said: I believe that the big bang/nothing are immortal: they don't have a beginning or an end.  You still cant seem to shake off the idea that atheism proposes its own theories. This simply isn't true. Atheist is just agnosticism with attitude; in other words, atheism doesn't know anything, it just rejects religious theory. To be an atheist is not to believe in nothing, it is not know where we came from any more than any other human being on this planet, but to know enough that some of the theories proposed by human beings on this planet are absurd. Indeed, I would say that believing absurdities is much closer to believing in nothing than anything atheism offers up, because your belief is measured by faith, which is, as we all know, your willingness to deny reality.	0
"I think you're missing the point. I said the majority of the world calls it Christmas... and by ""it"", I mean Christmas. So, the majority of the world calls Christmas, Christmas. That makes sense, right? If you put up a Christmas tree and decorate it, put presents underneath it, put up Christmas lights, listen to Christmas music, tell your kids Santa is coming and so on... which holiday does that sound like? There's only one that I can think of that consists of those exact same things... and it's Christmas. Why take away the term if you're going to celebrate it the exact same way as Christians?  Many people wear green on St. Patrick's day, despite the fact that they aren't Catholic. Would you avoid telling people ""Happy St. Patrick's Day""? Maybe you could take away the ""Saint"" and just call it Patrick's Day lol.  The term Christmas doesn't have to mean to you what it means to Christians, but if you're celebrating it the same way, call it what it is! All that being said, if you don't partake in any tradition that is just like Christmas, then of course wishing you a ""Merry Christmas"" would be dumb."	"Apologies, I did misunderstand your point. That being said, I do not understand why you are making the point you are making. I do not think that anyone is saying ""don't call Christmas, Christmas."" The argument is that people should not go around wishing people they do not know a Merry Christmas (which I think we might actually agree on?). If someone celebrates Christmas they can call it whatever they want in my opinion; just don't assume that I celebrate it.  With respect to St. Patrick's day, likewise people celebrating it should call it whatever they like. The only real difference is that St. Patrick's day is largely divorced from its origins whereas Christmas is still very strongly associated with Christianity (most people who were green on St. Patrick's day don't even know what the guy did, but most people who put up a tree on Christmas know that it's about the birth of Jesus)."	0

Because it makes sense to the child to cry. And you cannot blame a baby for crying, they have to, can they get their own food? NO, can they change their own diaper? NO. Also which world do you live in???? (no offense, if grown ups don't cry in your world then i envy you) Grown ups most certainly do cry for pointless reasons. The reason for this so called 'selfishness' is only because it is too young to understand life. It only understands that it needs to sleep, cry, poop and eat.	Because it makes sense to the child to cry. Yes, but that doesn't make is not pointless and not selfish. And you cannot blame a baby for crying, they have to, can they get their own food? I already told you I don't blame them for anything. That doesn't make them any less selfish. It is in their evolutionary design to be selfish, cute and annoying so that something takes care of them. Also which world do you live in???? (no offense, if grown ups don't cry in your world then i envy you) Umad bro? Grown ups most certainly do cry for pointless reasons. Not in my world. A grown up crying in my world includes reasons over serious emotional stress which have more meaning then crying over your pants being shit in. If an adult cries because they shit their pants on accident, they're a big baby, because only a baby cries over something so pointless. If a baby knew better, it could change it's own diaper. But it doesn't know better because it's small and is designed by evolution to come out of the womb helpless so that some creature other then itself will take care of it. The reason for this so called 'selfishness' is only because it is too young to understand life. That doesn't make it any less selfish. Did you know that most mammals stand up within the first 5 minutes of them being born? It's because they are programmed to automatically know how to survive when they come out of the womb. A human baby is not. It's not it's fault it's designed by evolution to be more helpless then the newborns of other species, but that, once again, doesn't mean it's not selfish. I'm not blaming it for anything. It can't help it because that's what nature intended. But for the last time... that does not mean it is not any of these things, these things being extremely selfish and lazy.  If a baby weren't selfish and lazy, then it would stand up and start taking care of most of it's needs by itself within 5 minutes like most other newborn mammals instead of crying to the point that other creatures cannot stand not taking care of it. Thusly, if an adult is crying over something as stupid as spilled milk, a lack of 100% comfort, waking up in the middle of the night, or shitting themselves, then they are crying like a baby. An adult who cries over something emotionally meaningful, like a divorce or death, then they are just crying. Not crying like a baby.	0
I watched a lot of TV when I was younger. I turned out just fine. I had a TV in my room, and was not really supervised with what I watched. Yet I was never poorly influenced or learned any bad behaviors from it. If anything I learned from the stupidity I saw. And besides, there is a lot you can learn on TV. As long as the kid is still getting some exercise and is overall healthy and doing good in school, then let them watch TV.	TV affects not only on health, but on children’s minds too.	0

All this is equally a conjecture. No, it is not. Prove for me that alien life exists. Prove it doesn't, and I'll stop calling it a conjecture. Then would you care to explain how the Egyptians went from an extremely primitive state to 'all of a sudden' having much knowledge on mathematics, astronomy, engineering - in some cases, even better knowledge than us? Or what about the Mesopotamians and their 'drawings' of aliens? Or what about the many thousands - or is it millions? - of 'alien abduction cases'? How about trying to explain away all those hundreds of millions of 'UFO sightings'? While you are at it, you might want to figure out how 'abductees' often have what appears to be an 'ultraviolet tattoo' of sorts (I can't recall the precise details off hand). All hoaxes. Cept that the Eygptians didn't get so smart so suddenly (it took time), and whatever the Mesopotamians drew, it just so happened that some fit our version of an alien. How many drawings have been dismissed or relegated to the back shelf because they would cause no excitement? Maybe they have technology capable of rendering useless our best weapons. And if they don't? I'd rather be the man who was prepared for the LARGE threat that never came than the one who wasn't prepared for the one the did come. If they don't, hooray. Assume that using extremely advance methods which I cannot imagine, we are able to deduce that a certain species of orangutans will become far more intelligent than humans 30 000 years into the future. Guess what we're going to do? Eradicate them, most likely; however, that would be out of fear on our part. We wouldn't not know that they would mean us harm; we'd be letting our fear get in the way of things. It's the same situation with aliens and us. Is it, now? Why not? Do they lack the emotion fear?	Prove it doesn't, and I'll stop calling it a conjecture. The burden of proof is on you. All hoaxes. Cept that the Eygptians didn't get so smart so suddenly (it took time), and whatever the Mesopotamians drew, it just so happened that some fit our version of an alien.

As I said, they evolved into the creatures we see today. They are gone, replaced by their extant descendants. But shouldn't it be happening again? Shouldn't Natural Selection, in her Random Wisdom, be trying to get reptiles to fly? I understand the ones that existed have died, but should't new ones be showing up?	Again, evolution is still happening. You did not tell me why you think it is not. Evolution is not 'trying' to get any species to do anything. It's not random but it doesn't want all reptiles to fly or all primates to turn into homo sapiens. If reptiles are perfectly capable of finding food on the ground, why would they do anything except for hone adaptations that help them do that more efficiently? Species change in response to their environments. The less an environment changes, the less creatures who utilize that environment are likely to change as well.	0

With this law, someone could be born in another country by accident: i.e. on holiday, and grow up to run for president and their opposition could dig this up to kick the competition out.	Actually, there is a clause for that. If both of the parents are citizens, it's the same as being born in the US. Or on a US military base or Embassy. They created that because it's happened. For example, some Kenyans immigrants, who became citizens, had a child while they were visiting relatives in Kenya. Since both parents are naturalized citizens, their kid is a natural born citizen, and could run for president if it wanted to.	0

I agree 100% with this. This is why I support the death sentance. If you kill someone for no reason and it is 100% that you did it not in defense but to kill someone in the first place, then you should be put to death.	What if you cause a car accident and don't kill someone but permanently injure them? Should the person at fault be permanently injured in turn? Through the use of a vehicle? What if it was truly an accident that was beyond anyone's control?

Two things. First, in a democratic society citizens get the government they choose. Citizens in democratic societies cannot deny responsibility for the actions of their government. If you consider soldiers also citizens capable of thinking and moral scrutiny, then neither bear responsibility too. Second, even if it isn't their fault the government made an idiot decision, that doesn't mean they have to execute idiot decisions. A soldier has the free will to be military disobedient in agreement with her/his consciousness.	Democracy People vote for their government, but they are not the government. Those in government hold all the information available to make judgement calls, especially the information sensitive to national security. The people don't have the information, so they can't be blamed. They should, however, choose leaders who they know to be morally sound. . Soldiers have free will Yes, they have free will, but they lack the information to exercise that free will appropriately. If all soldiers act on the limited information available to them all the time, then there'd be chaos. A country cannot have an undisciplined defence force, which would be worse than not having one at all.	0

Then they are in greater danger of being injured if they are in an accident, than if they sat in the back. Of course, if they sit in the back, they are still in danger, but the danger increases if they sit in the front. what if they hid under the chair or in front of it instead? at the front? I don't think there is any problem sitting at the front. Although there is danger, it is still okay to sit at the front  I mean, the headline is 'Should elementary school students be allowed to ride in the front seat of a car' There is a difference. this is about whether they should sit at the front. The other debate is about whether it is safer at the front or the back.  Ask all traffic experts, they will all say the same. Are you sure? that is how you turn off airbags. the only said about ford focus cars	There is a difference. this is about whether they should sit at the front. The other debate is about whether it is safer at the front or the back. When you open a debate about whether children should sit in the front seat of a car, you can't avoid people talking what is safer or not. If I can't use safety as my argument to why children shouldn't sit in front, what did you expect the arguments against it to be ? Are you sure? A very big majority will say so. the only said about ford focus cars What car do you have ?	0

"A federal appeals court in New York found the board's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion. That's all you need to know. It doesn't matter if they're praying to the god of the Bible or The Great Pumpkin.  If they want to pray, they can do so on their own time and their own dime, not while spending tax payer dollars."	What happens if God is running the government?	0
"I come to believe that dreams has nothing to do with how we would run our life, and it could also just be a manifestation of something that happened to us with our daily existence.  But here: I use to dream about a certain event; it was vivid because it was like a flash in my mind before I wake up. So I tend to forgot about it because as we know it was just a dream. And everybody experience it anyway, no big deal. Few days pass and I was exactly in the state where I was in my dream saying the same words. After I said it, I was like ftw. This happened to me before. Then I remember my dream. I ask some people about it, and they claim that it sometimes happen. It was like a jejavu. I have done some research and I came up with a term ""prolific dream"" it is the state where we are more open to our psychic being. Its gets me thinking that if such things happen, could it be possible that all our tomorrows were already set?"	It's called Deja Vu, it's where your brain decides to file short term memories into the long term memory section as they're happening. You think you dreamed about something or have done it before, but in reality, you haven't. There's zero evidence supporting psychics.	0
It's hard to respect someone when their main argument is WORSHIP THE BEARDED MAN IN THE SKY OR BURN IN HELL FOREVER.	It's hard as a Christian to respect people who deny their maker and mock the one who died to take their place, but I do anyway because it's the Christlike thing to do.	0
I disagree about that. I'm Wiccan and we practice religious tolerance. We are open to other beliefs might be right. We are open to all sexualities and races. We strive to be an open minded belief.	I'm not religious, and I'm open to everything that makes sense, is logical, is actually based on reality. Something based on fantasy and taken as real, and as a result requiring shutting out parts of reality, requires criticism to the opposite of its nature. Being religious, following some made up scripture or any fantasy is being closed, at least partly, to actual reality.	0
"Then rebel. Oh, believe me, if it ever gets to so great a level of control, I most certainly shall. They were offered religious refuge. Just what does this mean? I know nothing about the Amish. I'm not sure if they even qualify as an ethnic group. They are not a separate ethnic group, but they are a distinct and separate society. No. They represent their own interests. That has always been my position.  True. New Labour have never done anything good. Never.  Correct. Democracy is a veil for despotism.  It would seem that we agree on many issues. Don't get me started on them (unless you like rants of volcanic proportions). Yes, I do. But not of volcanic proportions, I'd prefer one of super-calderic proportions (behemoth, if you will). There could be a justice system which can punish criminals, but be unable to make laws or do anything beyond administering justice. Who, in your mind, should make the laws? I believe, as I stated, that all the necessary laws were made long ago. These are just about all the laws that I believe are necessary: (""T"" = augmentation) You shall not murder You shall not commit adultery T You shall not steal T - With regards to rape, etc. I suppose that I am quite the individualist. would the right to make laws. So to whom would that right belong?"	"Oh, believe me, if it ever gets to so great a level of control, I most certainly shall. Good. I shall join you. Bring firebombs. Just what does this mean? I know nothing about the Amish. The Amish moved to America to flee religious persecution in Switzerland, France and Germany. As America had no state religion, their beliefs were safe.  They are not a separate ethnic group, but they are a distinct and separate society. Please look at the debate title. The fifth word. It would seem that we agree on many issues. Great minds...do not use clichés. It is true, our thoughts are often mirrored.  Yes, I do. But not of volcanic proportions, I'd prefer one of super-calderic proportions (behemoth, if you will). It began, as always, with the desire to do good, or at least, to appear as though they were trying to do good. Inevitably, this led to yet another period of contraction; of economy, liberty and of general happiness. Tony Blair, the devil-worshipping, lying perfidious, insidious, deplorable bastard that he is, used every means of corruption and disinformation in his arsenal to maintain labour power. That Labour were allowed in at all is a travesty. After Margaret Thatcher saved the United Kingdom's economy from the seemingly interminable decline with which it had been plagued for decades, Labour began to spout lies at a rate not even Obama could match. Once elected, they presently engaged themselves in gathering Asylum Seekers from the four corners of the world. Mosques began to spring up like weeds, middle class England was forced to retreat, faced as it was with a tidal wave of Muslims and all manner of depraved and vulgar peoples. Worse is what they did to the economy, so recently mended. Should a man have employment, he will enter his auto-mobile or board whichever public transport as will carry him most swiftly to his destination. If not, then neither. Instead he will amble gaily to some public house, there to drown all sorrows, murder all doubts, with strong spirits and similar company; these two mix'd are a potent poison, for in such treatment of problems one merely compounds them. So it is that sacred England is blighted. This is the handiwork of the suited labourers, purveyors of doom and misfortune. ever have they imported eastern poisons, the veiled mysteries, their fanatical masters and the usurers. All of these pale into insignificance when match'd with the enforcers of Health and Safety. Destroyers and usurpers curse them. They leave their mark everywhere, like dogs pissing on pylons. You must have seen it too, ""Keep off the Grass"", ""Danger, uneven surface"", ""No Smoking"", ""No breathing"", ""NO LIVING!"". Only now has sanity returned, for it was not lost, but retained; if only in the darkest corner of the hive mind. For England is fine, England is beautiful, as a proud and regal stag. Now fiercely embattled on all sides it is endangered. Truth has at last struck us. It must be conserved (I assure you, this is the brief version, for in Britannia it is 12:55 am, and even I must sleep at some point, though not until I have ensured my score is at least 150 and at number one - I'll die before I let Qymosabi gain first place again!). Who, in your mind, should make the laws? That's the beauty of it! Nobody will know! Confusion is more powerful than ignorance. I believe, as I stated, that all the necessary laws were made long ago. I concur.  T I presume you mean a law forbidding sexual depravities, as opposed to forbidding lust, sexual activity before marriage, and all that crap. I suppose that I am quite the individualist. Good. I have become an eccentric and have nothing but contempt for people who live in their little fantasy worlds of careers and family planning. My view is ""Make as much money as you feasibly can, and make as many children as you physically can"".  So to whom would that right belong? See above. Addendum (good word) In hindsight I should have supported you, but I am too tired to change it now. Good Night!"	0
Any time someone kills themselves, it is because God technically told them to. Since he is God, then he knows everything, and therefore knows all possibilities, which also means he knows how a particular situation will turn out, without even commencing the start of the situation. So by choosing this specific path to go down out of the many possible paths, means that he planned it to happen that way...but I'm just rambling here...zzz If he doesn't know everything... What justifiable reason could there possibly be to kill myself? Just because God told me to?   Yes, because God is justice and isn't to be questioned. Haha. Don't think so.	Congratulations, you just proved once again what an asshole you are, Dumbass!	0
It has? Please direct me to the evidence of this happening, as I was not aware of this. I require proof because I cannot believe something if there's not evidence to back it up. If my daughter was molested by my uncle, it's a different category as that is a personal depiction, where as the Bible is a written depiction. If my daughter is showing signs of molestation, I'd know. No worries on the punctuation, I'm not one to judge. Just a year ago I would have had similar grammar to RandomDude. As long as I can read it, I'm not overly concerned.

Are skin cells capable of developing into a human being? Were you developed from skin cells? The lump of tissues you are referring to refers to the growing body parts of a human being which is why it possesses a different human DNA and blood type. Human skin cells, like an embryo and foetus, cannot feel or think. They are alive but not an individual. Let me ask you a question in a hospital or in executing in someone when does a doctor pronounce life and death? Isn't it upon resuming or hearing the heart beats and upon terminating the heart beats. Therefore the presence of heartbeats indicates life. If you lose your heart beat, you are basically in the process of dying. However gaining a heartbeat doesn't make you an individual. Why then if there is no life in it that there is a presence of heartbeat?  I said that a foetus is alive but not a life. For example, if 1000 foetuses died, you wouldn't say that 1000 lives were lost. A foetus is in the process of becoming a life worthy of human rights. So then if it is not human, then what is it? Is it an animal or a plant or is it a member of the family of homosapiens? It is human but not a human person. Whether or not our brain is fully developed does not matters. What matters is that we have the brain of a human being and A BRAIN IN GENERAL BECAUSE EACH OF US GOES THROUGH A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. WHICH IS WHY SOME OF OUR BRAIN ARE SMALLER THAN OTHER PEOPLE. RIGHT? A brain that isn't developed isn't self aware, isn't an individual. Individuality requires a brain developed past a certain point. I checked that picture you showed me and i recalled seeing a human body with eyes. If it is not a proper human then how come it is a human being at all? To say that it is not a proper human because it is not fully developed is foolish. You yourself called it HUMAN WHEN YOU JUST SAID IT IS NOT HUMAN BUT RESEMBLES HUMAN. ARE YOU CONFUSED ON THIS TOPIC?  No, you yourself are confused. A living thing can be human, but not a human being. That embryo and foetus are living human tissues but they are not human beings yet. The person you are referring to is someone who is a medical professional firstly. Because it does not have person hood does not mean that it does not possess human life when it has everything like a human being. It doesn't matter whether or not it is human. If it isn't a person then it doesn't have rights. In the same way should we kill someone who has lost their person hood when they become unconscious. Because according to the scientific research and theory, a person loses personhood when they faint or become unconscious. To understand this you have to understand that a person loses self awareness, the ability to communicate, touch or feel, consciousness or self motivation at the time of losing consciousness which is similar to a fetus in the womb. This is nothing at all like a foetus in the womb. A person who becomes unaware still has a brain that stores their individuality, they have still grown and lived a life that grants them individual rights. A foetus has none of this. There is a deeper context to the term life. Which person in their right mind would give a literal definition of the term than giving a deeper scientific meaning? Why don't you try to understand the terms life and live because both are used to describe the fetus which breathes, has a heartbeat and human DNA and HUMAN BLOOD TYPE AND ORGANS. I'll put this to you very simply since you keep missing it. I could take human organs and sew them together and bind them to a steel skeleton. It is not a person, however. Just because it has human blood and organs, its own DNA, can breathe and has a heartbeat, doesn't make it a person. It has no individuality because it hasn't got a brain capable of that.	Answer my question. Don't try to avoid it. Are skin cells capable of developing into a human being? Are skin cells made up of a different human DNA and blood type? Skin cells are from the body of the person while the cells of the embryo are the growing human body of another human being. But gaining a heartbeat makes you an alive human? right? And thank you, the fetus has a beating heart which makes it a human organism that is alive. What are you even talking about. Firstly life has to do with the chemical properties of a living being and the cellular reactions that takes place within that organism. Are you getting the term life we used to describe our daily routine or are you describing the scientific term of life? Live refers to whether the fetus is alive or dead. Both of these terms are proved by the fetus because it has a beating heart which means that is it alive and it has chemical and molecular processes ongoing with cellular reaction which makes it an organism with life. Another explanation of the term life also refers to the presence of living organisms which is why when scientists or astronauts go to other planets they say there is no life? Why? Because there are no signs of living organisms.  So then if it is a living human then does that not makes it like a person who is unconscious and has lose their personhood?  Again a person whose brain is developed but loses consciousness has lose their personhood. Rather than helping them, should we eliminate their existence then? Why is it that you do not know the difference between actual tissues and the growing body of the unborn. That picture you showed me possessed the growing body of an unborn along with a pair of eyes, feet and hands. Why do you not double check it? But the point is they are from the human race? right? Why then when the dead body of a person is stolen, criminal charges have to instituted against the accused? Because the body is a human too and it is not alive. Why is this? Because they are from the human race which gives them rights like any other living human. If it is does not matter then you are disrespecting life of a human in general. The life of the unborn which makes it alive and in which both me and you have so what makes it different? Because it is not self aware and independent? Come on, open your eyes because anybody regardless if you are already born can lose your self awareness or independence but they still have a human life? Right? So why then do they describe a person in that stage as being in the baby stage. The only difference there is that one has not been born as yet but one has already been. But they are both humans? Right? They both posses human life and both does not have personhood. Right? You seem to be failing to understand the concepts of science. A skeleton will have no life in it. Why? Because the DNA is not alive and neither is there any cells or blood alive and this is a different case with the unborn. And a steel skeleton is not the product of human reproduction either. And lastly you would sew those parts together but the formation of the unborn is formed from a natural, living and completely technical scientific process in which all the elements of science and biology are brought together to create a living being from the human race. And finally, your blood type and DNA will not go with the skeleton neither will the blood cells survive outside a living human body so what are you trying to prove?	0

"I was just trying to say that the ""common good"" isn't in everyone's best interest. Nietzsche's paradox of democracy: in a democratic society I have 2 masters: my will and the majority's will. There is no guarantee that they will ever coincide. We can speculate about this all day but it doesn't change the simple and obvious fact that deregulating businesses makes them exploitative. And, who gets to decide the common good, Mr. Machiavelli? Obviously myself, since otherwise it'd just be some libertarian who holds a textbook as more authoritative than reality. This is me being facetious by the way."	Niether does it change the fact that regulations decrease economic growth and performance. And those things benefit everyone.	0
What's funny is I think this is beginning to sound like conservative bias! If she wins, which I don't think she will. So far passed this election the Democrats have the advantage in the electoral map. Virginia which I thought was going to be the most crucial state of the night turns out Obama won that by a higher margin than he won the popular vote therefore Virginia is now more Democratic than the average state, the Republicans have nowhere to go in 2016 unless they get somebody like Rubio to oppose somebody other than Clinton. Also if Bill won I don't see how his wife can't, the electoral map is probably going to turn out similar to 1992 and 1996 with Clinton winning the common red states of Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana and even Arizona if the Republican has a chance of taking traditional Democratic states good for them, but not only does Clinton have the advantage in the Arkansas area the states we expected to be very tight in 2012 turned out to look like average blue states if the Republicans CAN'T take any blue states they will be totally lost in the 2016 election! Overall though I think the map is going to be a mix of 1992 and 1996. As for my thoughts on Obama As I had said before Obama was a disappointment but he still did great things for the country, the affordable health care act was passed under him making him the first president to pass a law for universal health care. Obama repealed Don't ask don't tell! He ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama Bin Laden. And he passed the dream act. The debt is beginning to drop as well. My problem is that he another corporate drone in office the top 1% of Americans own 40% of the nations wealth and Obama won't do anything about it. The corporate tax rate is still the second lowest in the world as well! He has not signed any bill to ban assault weapons. Also he happens to support capital punishment and the war on drugs!	What's funny is I think this is beginning to sound like conservative bias! If she wins, which I don't think she will. I already told you that I am not conservative. I'm trying to convince you to be unbiased. If you were a conservative trash-talking all liberals, then I'd still be arguing with you. I don't think Clinton will win. I never said that I don't want her to win... even though I don't. the Republicans have nowhere to go in 2016 unless they get somebody like Rubio to oppose somebody other than Clinton. Obama's final term will be the deciding factor. So far it doesn't look good for the Democrat's.   Also if Bill won I don't see how his wife can't I never said she can't, I just don't think she will. If she does win, it won't be because of who her husband is. As for my thoughts on Obama As I had said before Obama was a disappointment but he still did great things for the country, the affordable health care act was passed under him making him the first president to pass a law for universal health care. Obamacare is a bunch of shit. It's cons outweigh it's pros. He ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama Bin Laden. The war wasn't with Iraq, it's with Al Qaeda. We no longer have a military presence in Iraq, but we're still in the Middle East. Turn on the news, we're going to war with Syria! So now we are not only at war with Al Qaeda... but Syria as well. He didn't end a war, he added one. And he passed the dream act. Education for illegal immigrants? Yeah, that was real important... The debt is beginning to drip as well. The debt has increased by more than $6 Trillion dollars since he took office his second term. It is the largest debt increase under any President.	0

Hockey is clearly a useless game. They need to go out on the ice to fish instead.	I completely disagree with that statement. If its useless than why is there NHL teams?

No, eugenics are not ethical. Forcing sterility upon anyone sounds completely asinine. I'd like to hear why exactly this act would not be unethical.

Robots can have the intelligence to create better versions of themselves (a 2.0 version) thus letting them evolve and adapt to newer circumstamnces, even if it's an odd way to go about it. As for emotions, they'll have a limited version but while that prohibits them from somethings, it also leads to a greater freedom in choices. We're comparing them to humans but these machines could be their own whole new species. The whole concept of life could be renewed, a whole world not created by God perhaps but made by humans!  And as for why we'd bother with them, it just seems inevitable that our curiosity or even our reliance on machines could lead us to create more and better machines. not all of us even believe that robots could take control or that we can't live side by side with a sentient species for limited resources in an ever populated Earth. This is the generation that revers tech. If you read the article below, you'll see how children now prefer robots to their everyday authority figures.	Robots can have the intelligence to create better versions of themselves (a 2.0 version) thus letting them evolve and adapt to newer circumstamnces, even if it's an odd way to go about it. That's all well and good, but it is not evolution as we know it. There are no genes, no memes, nothing that is vital for biological evolution. Unless you create something biological, or possibly hybrid, then there is no evolution. And machinery is not biological. As for emotions, they'll have a limited version but while that prohibits them from somethings, it also leads to a greater freedom in choices. No greater than our own freedom of choice. How does having certain choices prohibited lead to a greater freedom of choices? Unless you incorporated some sort of rebellion feature, but I don't know why one would do that. Just out of curiosity, would you treat a racist robot any differently than a racist human? these machines could be their own whole new species Not by the definition of species, which I understand it to be. As far as I'm aware, a species is a group of living organisms subordinate to a genus. Thus, robots do not meet the criteria. And as for why we'd bother with them, it just seems inevitable that our curiosity or even our reliance on machines could lead us to create more and better machines.  I can agree with that. Human curiosity will inevitably lead us to let every single cat out of the bag, no matter what the consequences. And our reliance will probably lead us to endeavour further into robotics, perhaps even sentient. But then again, maybe not. Who knows? Whilst the article is charming, it is not something we can found societies on. I find it hard to believe that robots could be sentient because an 8 year old wants them to be. Quite frankly, I value the opinions of those over the age of 10 to be the most relevant when discussing the philosophy of artificial intelligence.	0

It's hard to imagine there are parents who excel at all subjects taught in a school. It is also hard to imagine home schooling does not in many instances create an unhealthy separation complex once it is finally time to leave the nest. I think it's important children learn to act in a social environment prior to full brain development. Maybe that's just me.	Obviously you aren't a homeschool kid or parent. I am (a homeschool kid) and I know how many other homeschool kids there are. There are heaps, and there are heaps of things to do. Most of the days of my week are spent with loads of other homeschool kids. Honestly, you just have to sit down and say 'no' to most of the activities. There are netball teams, soccer teams, rugby teams, basketball teams, other sport teams, heaps of homeschool groups, drama classes, writing classes, other classes and the list goes on. Those are just in my small area. People think that homeschool kids don't have an idea about 'social' stuff, but unless they're one themselves, they don't know the truth.	0

Because it has been tested. There is a reason why children aren't alllowed to sit in front, you don't think rules like that are there just annoy us do you? The old cars don't have airbag, are probably unsafe on several other areas. But like I said in my argument, if there is none, or if it's turned of - the child has no reason to not sit in the front. Although when I have children in my car, I want them to sit in the back, because it is a lot more safer to sit there. I know that there are exceptions. And how do you turn off airbags I actually don't know. I've never done it myself, and to be honest I don't really know if you actually can do it.

True, however that's not the point of the debate. The point is that she's taking offense to a prayer and has taken specific action to make it not be allowed.

I am aware of what she did and wants done and I already gave input on that.   However, if a Christian takes offense to an atheist and even thinks about saying something they're all of a sudden a bigot. I disagree. If you are offended then report it. You are allowed to do so.

Any time someone kills themselves, it is because God technically told them to. Since he is God, then he knows everything, and therefore knows all possibilities, which also means he knows how a particular situation will turn out, without even commencing the start of the situation. So by choosing this specific path to go down out of the many possible paths, means that he planned it to happen that way...but I'm just rambling here...zzz If he doesn't know everything... What justifiable reason could there possibly be to kill myself? Just because God told me to?   Yes, because God is justice and isn't to be questioned. Haha. Don't think so.	Simply because He has chosen a certain path for a person, it does not mean that He has told them to commit suicide. It simply means that He has determined the choice of the person who commits suicide. Hence, we have a division of a revealed and divine will.	0
Ok.... 1. Do you blame the media, or the women that allow themselves to be in Cosmo? I mean, it's not like men are MAKING them pose for these pictures. They CHOSE to do it. To me, that's not a victim.  2. The ONLY reason men aren't in mags and tv wearing little to no clothes is because it doesn't sell all that well. The reason? Men are much more visual than women. If women were as visual as men, and enjoyed looking at pictures of men wearing little clothes, believe me, it would be all over the place too.   My point is there is no real victim here. It is win/win/win. The women who do it enjoy doing it, and make money off it. The companies that use the pictures and images sell their product. The men that like looking at the women's pictures like getting the opportunity to look at them. Win/win/win.   I agree women should not be victims of sexual discrimination, harrassment, or abuse (just like men shouldn't either, but it happens). But I don't think you successfully argue that it's directly related to Cosmo magazine.	"You are again missing the point. I'm not worried half as much about the impact of media sexism on Tyra Banks as I am concerned with the effects of media stereotyping on ordinary women. While certainly there are elements of victimization within the modeling industry itself (hullo, eating disorders!) the problem is not that the models are themselves personally victimized so much as that media stereotyping (in conjunction with a number of other gender-perception issues; I'm not saying it's 100% the fault of ""the media"") puts women as a group in positions of victimization by making women invisible except within narrowly-circumscribed roles such as ""sex object."""	0
and look what the rich did to lincoln? incidentally whilst churchilll is the greatest war leader in history, and next to lloyd george the greatest orator, his domestic record wasnt great to say the least and he was booted after the war too.

I don't think I understand what you are saying a picnic table is.   Anything can be used as a picnic table. Just because it doesn't suit the characteristics of what some people call a picnic table doesn't mean that it can't be used.  How intimately do you have to know something to know that you know it?  I know I am a person but I can't prove it by any means further than showing you myself.	That's the point I have we don't know what it is, we know nothing.

We do not yet have a fully accepted theory to explain gravity, but we observe its effects and we know it is real.  The effects of emotions can be observed both externally and internally. Progress is being made in understanding the chemical reactions behind emotions. But even without knowledge of the chemical process, we would know emotions to be a real phenomenon.

you're logic is correct apart from the fact that cows aren't an endangered species, and also when the kill cows they don't slice there heads of or smash them to peices.	Yeah, they just let them lie in a box of their own crap for a few years and then cut their throats and skin them, sometimes while they are still conscious. I do not oppose people eating animals but there does seem to be some inconsistency in this case. Does your issue with this really stem from their endangered status? If so, why use their mistreatment as evidence when other food animals recieve comparable treatment? Does it have anything to do with you maybe thinking turtles are cuter, or not actually knowing what happens to the animals you eat?	0

Under the electoral college, all votes do not count equally. Voters in some states have more say in selecting the president than voters in other states. For example, California has 55 electoral college votes, while Delaware only get 3 votes. There is not equality in that, every state should be equal, California for voting purposes is no more important that Delaware.	Delawarians get more of a say than Californians. There are 917K people in Delaware, and 38 million in California. Delaware gets an electoral vote for every 305K people. California only gets a vote for each 691K people. Each person in Delaware has twice as much voting power as the people in California.	0
No one is moral, for no one is good. However, it remains to be said that a Christian will be more moral than his state of nature. Regardless, even as a Christian, no one is good. This misunderstanding is based in the idea that one can earn his way to heaven: no one can earn his way to heaven, for it must be given to him. God is simply picking out of a group of convicts whomever He wants to be His elect.	A convict is someone who breaks the law.

What is the difference between Jews and Christians? Basically the religion is the same. 2000 years ago, all christians were jews. A jew believes, that God and the Holy Spirit exists. Jesus - or Messiah is the person they're expecting. They are excepting the person, christians believe have already been here. That is the main difference between those religions. So when Jesus came, some people chose to go on with their old beliefs, and keep on waiting for Messiah(Those were the Jews), and some chose to believe that Jesus was the expected Messiah(Those were the Christians). So if Jesus never came to earth, then the new testament never would have been written, and all jews would still be jews. No one would teach a new religion (christianity) about Jesus. If you google: What is christianity based on You'll find several answers that look like: Jesus blah blah blah.. If christianity is based on Jesus, then it is based on the new testament. Because Jesus did not exist in the old testament. Jesus is what christianity is based on - therefore christianity is based on new testament, not the entire bible. (actually only the four first books in the bible, the Gospels, which tells the story of Jesus Christ)	What is the difference between Jews and Christians Bingo! The difference is that Jew don't believe in the New testament, just the old. Christians believe in both.	0

Actually America does have an official language, English. meaning that Puerto Rico would have to make English their primary language also.	Yes, but in America, the Spanish langue is rapidly rising. Already in Texas, you see that a preponderance of signs and advertisements have been converted to Spanish. This is not just true for Texas. Any state bordering Mexico has a high Spanish speaking population and if Americans do not believe we should keep everything in English, even though it is our most spoken langue, and believe instead to accommodate the immigrants and their needs instead, we can easily do it for Puerto Rico as well. My mother’s parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. She has nieces and nephews that have graduated high school from the country and they are fluent in both Spanish and English. The school systems insist upon teaching in both Spanish and English. Not only in Puerto Rico, but here in Texas and in California, there is a massive number of the population speaking Spanish. If you go to SAISD, most of the kids speak very little to no English and their parents most likely speak none. Same as in areas in California. America can easily accommodate their langue needs. Look around you when you go out in San Antonio, in some areas Spanish signs come before English. And even still in other areas there are no English signs. Many businesses and education institutes already cater to langue barriers, our own school offers ESL (English as a Second Langue), and so it would be easy for Puerto Ricans to get along in the United States, even without knowing English.	0
"Apologies, I did misunderstand your point. That being said, I do not understand why you are making the point you are making. I do not think that anyone is saying ""don't call Christmas, Christmas."" The argument is that people should not go around wishing people they do not know a Merry Christmas (which I think we might actually agree on?). If someone celebrates Christmas they can call it whatever they want in my opinion; just don't assume that I celebrate it.  With respect to St. Patrick's day, likewise people celebrating it should call it whatever they like. The only real difference is that St. Patrick's day is largely divorced from its origins whereas Christmas is still very strongly associated with Christianity (most people who were green on St. Patrick's day don't even know what the guy did, but most people who put up a tree on Christmas know that it's about the birth of Jesus)."	"I should make it clear that I didn't watch the video and am making the point that certain people who celebrate Christmas refuse to call it that. ""X-Mas"" would be an example. It's kind of like if you were to drive a Ford and say that it's a Chevy. You can call it a Chevy, but it's really a Ford. Same goes for Christmas. You can call it something else, but it's really Christmas. I don't think Christmas is associated with Christianity as much as it used to be. It's basically Santa-Day to most people.  I wouldn't say that St. Patrick's Day is divorced from it's origins, just that most people are unknowingly celebrating a religious holiday... and the thing is, I don't think people would really care, religious or not.  I can only really speak for myself here, but Christmas to me is about family and showing that you care about them. I'm not religious, so the whole birth of Jesus thing isn't a big deal to me, but I don't mind being part of a tradition that celebrates his birth. Jesus had some great teachings. Some of the stuff from the Bible was pretty screwed up, but there are some good bits, which mostly came from the teachings of Jesus. Christmas in the religious sense is a celebration of Jesus, not the Bible in it's entirety.  I understand, that since you are a homosexual, you feel like an outcast from anything Christian-related. You have to realize why homosexuality has been frowned upon throughout history. I believe that it's more instinctual for heterosexuals to find it wrong because we're wired to maintain our species. Homosexuality can only be acceptable when it is a minority, because if it were a majority then the human race would be declining.  Homosexuality was considered to be a sin because it was believed to be a choice, which as a heterosexual, I can only compare your mindset to mine. I'm just naturally attracted to women, so I can only assume that you are naturally attracted to men. I'm sure you didn't wake up one day and say ""Forget women, I'm going to try out men!"". The problem was that men weren't and most still aren't, able to wrap their heads around the notion that certain men are naturally attracted to other men... or that some women are naturally attracted to other women. So, since they thought it was a choice, they also thought that it could catch on, or become a trend. Rather than using a population as large as the world's, I'll use the people of Old Testament, aka Israel. They feared that if homosexuality were to become popular and become the majority population in Israel, then their people would eventually cease to exist. So, because of this mindset, desperate measures were taken to try and prevent people from becoming homosexuals. They weren't wrong though. If the majority of the world was gay, then the human population definitely would end up declining. They just happened to be ignorant of the reason why certain people are gay.  Religion has maintained the survival of ancient thought and now modern thought is finally starting to take over. Christianity will eventually evolve and possibly even die out, but Christmas will likely always exist... and not just the tradition, but the name as well, because we like to know the origins of our cultures and traditions. What Christmas should be and what it likely will eventually be, is a celebration of family, history and humanity."	0
"Part of being strong is being able to accept help when you need it. It's a reasonable accomidation to help people cope with their disabilities. How would the world be happier? There would still be people with disabilities, just fewer. You definition of ""happiness"" needs to be defined. Forced abortion, in your opinion."

Accepting help when you need it is just being reasonable.	0
Lol, no you stupid idiot. When did I ever say that? Christian beliefs are based on the new testament. Christian beliefs are based on, that Jesus came down to earth to save us from Hell (just to clarify, I don't believe in hell) This story is in the new testament, therefore Christianity is based on the new testament. We don't think the old is bullshit and lies. The old testament carries a lot of good advice and really really great stories. But such things as sacrificing sheep and stuff they did in the old, we don't do that. That's why we believe in the new testament, not in the old.	Lol, no you stupid idiot Well, that's very Christian of you, isn't it? Do most Christians believe God created the world in six days?	0
But it is not our fault, why are we made to pay because of it? We still have a sinful nature. Our sinful nature has been passed down from generation to generation, beginning with Adam and Eve.

Its genetics. Here's what you believe: After millions of Jews were tortured and slaughtered during the Holocaust, they went straight to hell Yep, I believe it, up to an extent.

"It has nothing to do with ""liking"" one testament more than the other, Christian beliefs come from both testaments PERIOD and it doesn't really matter since they're both full of bullshit lies"	The Old Testament is the history of the Jewish people and the prophecies of the coming Messiah. The New Testament is the fulfillment of the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah.

They have better lives because either that's just the hand they were dealt or they worked for it. God doesn't set up our lives us and our parents do.	If it is the hand they are dealt than god could have given everyone equal chances, unless you don't believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent god of course. If they worked for it, why didn't god create everyone with the same measure of motivational drive and capacity to work? If some people work harder than others, god made them that way when it would have been equally as easy to make everyone equally hardworking thus you might say that means he intentionally made some people hardworkers than others.	0
English is actually one of the official languages of Puerto Rico. Although many speak Spanish, they are taught English from elementary school to high school and even into college.	I disagree. I'm an English teacher in Puerto Rico and have lived here for more than twenty years and let me tell you 80% of my students do not speak English. At most, 20 percent speak English and that's because they at one time had lived in the United States mainland. Go to any government office here on the island and the clerks will speak to you in Spanish. All transactions are conducted in Spanish. English is spoken more at tourist attractions--hotels, fine restaurants--but rarely is it spoken in other domains of life. Puerto Ricans are very proud of their Spanish roots and the Spanish language and when asked, the majority will answer that they are Puerto Rican, not American.  So even though it is true that both English and Spanish are recognized as being official languages of Puerto Rico, that is just on paper. In reality, Spanish is the first and primary language on the island.	0

Can you not agree that if someone doesn't want to have their child/killed taken away that they may abide by the law and control their desire to have unprotected sex? Nope, people in America don't want children at all and can't stop having unprotected sex, so I can't conclude that your statement is correct. Proof is their reaction. They commit suicide because they've seen their children die/taken away from them. So, you are saying that the one child policy causes suicides because the women can't control their sexual desires(kills your claim) and have children when they are not supposed to (you claim this wouldn't happen with your pro one child policy), so clearly they must not want to see children killed. Uh, how come their actions lead to dead babies? Shouldn't they have not had babies then? f you lack information yourself you can't make a good argument. So go do some research first then come back with hopefully a better argument. :D Oh, I am so sorry that I did what you do, I guess you are an asshole, seeing how you treat yourself. Apparently you never have evidence.	Nope, people in America don't want children at all and can't stop having unprotected sex This is Invalid considering there isn't even a one child policy in America So, you are saying that the one child policy causes suicides because the women can't control their sexual desires Nope Your assumption is far off. The suicides are caused because the woman/man broke the law and decided to have a child. (you claim this wouldn't happen with your pro one child policy) No I never directly stated that women WOULD NOT have children because of this policy, but that it could convince them not to have children.  Apparently you never have evidence. Can you prove I never have any evidence? :D	0
The verse in question does not specify species, but rather 'kind.' In fact, for most of recorded history we did not have the specific taxonomy for classifying animals that we have today. As such, the Arks mission isn't necessarily as daunting as all that. If one is to consider 'kind' as genus, family, or order rather than species, the space needed decreases significantly at each step. Given how new our current system of classification is, I would expect 'kind' most likely to fall somewhere between genus and family.	Kind only meant a type of animal. There are different translations that use a different word. It is talk about on animal not one species.	0

That does not prove that everyone has the desire to live.  Just because you don't have any desire to live doesn't mean you'll have the desire to inflict harm upon yourself.

As busy as today's urban workers are, who often are so busy that it is hard for them to even find a minute to grab a lunch. Restaurants come in very handy for the hard working people, especially that in most of modern families both husband and wife equally work and have no time to cook for one another. In order to balance the nutrients and be healthy the best solution is to concentrate their energy on work and treat themselves with fine restaurant dining later.	Eating at home save a lot of money, because the price includes not only food but also rent a table, service, waiters’ salary, and chef skills. So, the prices in restaurants increase several times. And if the price is low, then there is something wrong with quality of food.   Moreover, sometimes eating in restaurant can take more time than preparing meal at home so it can be also time-consumer. People have to wait for a long time until they are served, and food are prepared because it takes a lot of time to prepare some kinds of food. So it’s not always the good way of saving time.	0

You say you've based this on Christian tenets, but it's missing a few details so it's incorrect. The rules were made to be broken; that is, the rules could never have been followed in the first place. This is supposedly to assert that humanity is a poor, wretched thing that needs a god to kill part of himself and raise himself up so that he can glorify himself and save us miserable creatures. By your current abc, you are saying every human being goes to hell no matter what. Which directly contradicts Christianity's core tenets. Also I would like scriptural evidence that Satan is a 'warden', as well. That might help your case. Also, I can dispute your whole argument if you do not cite your sources, provide meaningful evidence/sources, etc. That's how a court system works. They don't accept hearsay or speculation as valid testimony, so why should I.	Please answer the following questions: Does God make the rules to live by? Is God the one responsible for sending people to Hell if they do not follow the rules enough? Is Satan in charge of punishing people in Hell?	0

"""Makes it clear""? He has a funny way of showing it. What about Africa, where millions of Christian children die every year? Is he making his love clear there?"	Without evil, good wouldn't exist. People die all the time. Sad fact of life - I don't remember anyone saying if you became a Christian, you wouldn't die. And God helps those who help themselves - Africa is mostly a third-world country, and there are children of God from other countries attempting to help citizens over there. Until the country can get itself on its feet, sickness and death will continue to be prevalent. I'm done with this pointless argument. You're obviously going to contradict everything I say, so I'm done. I have faith, that's all I can tell you. You can't explain to someone how to have faith - you either have it or you don't. You're determined not to think outside the box, so that's your problem, not mine.	0
You have to look a lot further than just the U.K. Look at all the countries in the world. Which countries have societies that you would like to live in? The educated countries or the uneducated countries? In other words, if you think education is so bad, try ignorance and then come tell me which one you like better ;)	Well that's defo a good point.. but my point is to argue how people always think education is an answer to solve people's problems in DEVELOPED countries. Obviously basic education i.e. maths sciences languages should be in every country but I'm focusing on PSHE and why it's schools that need to teach it and not parents or family.	0
Although sleazy does match the profile of any politician, Batman definitely has a better education and upbringing. Iron man is too haphazard and would probably end up passing some giant tax loopholes for his corporate buddies. Batman on the other hand would protect the weak and support and more Democratic party system.	Tony Stark (Iron Man) was a boy genius that entered MIT @ age 15 to study electrical engineering... I mean, look at that machine he created in a cave! Bruce Wayne (Batman) was just an engineer who was good at living off of his parents fortune and investigating things.	0
Who wants to be a proprietor with all the government regulations? Government regulations help big business due to economies of scale. In the long run, regulations hurt small business because of the high cost of compliance whereas big business benefits because it eliminates its competitors.	Who wants to be a proprietor with all the government regulations? Government regulations help big business due to economies of scale. You know if you looked at the situation while factoring in time, you'd see that the regulations that help big business got there because small businesses grew big and bought out some people in the position to make write those laws. That's how a free market works. Everyone starts equal, then some grow bigger, and then the big guys buy laws that impede their competition. In the long run, regulations hurt small business because of the high cost of compliance whereas big business benefits because it eliminates its competitors. Uh, no, not ALL regulations. Those regulations designed to impede competition because they were basically written by big business. But hey, you're a libertarian, so big business is your friend. It must have been the commies who wrote those laws.	0

Although Ps3 has had many good games; Xbox 360 also has Halo: 1,2,3, ODST, Reach and now Halo CE Anniversary.

Not really considering the land was stolen from the natives  	"Then we will have to track back through their own oral history to figure out which tribe stole which land from which ever other tribe. Many tribes roamed and warred and for no more noble reason than they needed or wanted the land that some other tribe had.  No one alive today stole any native lands. No one alive today lost their land to westward ""manifest destiny"".  It is entirely unjust to take from one group to give to a second group because of the actions of a third group who took things from a fourth group."	0
P Kulaks started to burn down their own crops so that they could prevent people like you from stealing their food	the food weren't stolen but since USSR was a communist state, food had to be collected by Stalin and given out under his command. Since food had to be shared, it was only right that the kulaks co-operate with stalin. :D with love, dawi.	0

I don't celebrate Halloween because of it's orgin story that the Celts held a festival of  Samhain. Which they believed that the ghosts of the dead will return.

Definitely not. I'm just old enough to have observed the gradual replacement of traditional methods of communication and information storage with computer and the internet. I think I'm incredibly lucky to be living at this time, to witness and enjoy the Digital Revolution. Because of the internet: I have friends from around the world, instead of local-only friends who add far less diversity to my life. However niche my interests are, I can find internet groups for it, instead of sitting around moping about how nobody knows what it's like to be me. I can catch up on the news anytime I want instead of having to wait for the daily paper or the 6 o'clock news. Casual research means typing a word into Google rather than asking around and hoping someone knows the answer, or digging through piles of junk in the library. Proper college research means searching a few databases for articles rather than digging through unimaginably large piles of junk in archives around the world. I watch movies whenever I want, instead of having to wait for the show to screen or to premiere in my country. If I want to buy something, I can look up reviews, product comparisons and price comparisons and make an informed choice, rather than walking to the shops and hoping that the shops salesperson will recommend what's right for me rather than what's right for their pockets. (As if.) Porn, nuff said.	"You don't have anymore friends with the Internet than you do in person. An acquaintance is not your friend. Friends are those people that will do almost anything for you without anything in return. People have many acquaintances, but few friends. Out of boredom one can find an interest on the Internet. ""Misery loves company."" Watch the news tonight and in a week it will be the same. Let me highlight it for you. 50/50 chance of rain, somebody shot, a Hollywood couple split up, some sports team won, and another video was a success on Utube.  As far as information goes, I'd suggest doing research into reliability. Check out Wikiapedia's disclaimer, for example. About the junk in the library, one should read it before dismissing it.  Casual research means reading someones opinion. I'm so glad that modern technology lets you sit on your ass and watch movies whenever you want. All hail the Internet.  About product reviews, who ever spends the most money gets the best reviews. See definition of capitalism. Porn, trying a real person and you'll lose more than just your virginity."	0
A demon and an angel are not similar. Demons are evil and can get into someone's body and then they will be demon possed. I have watched someone who had a demon inside them and a Christian took the demon out through the power of Jesus Christ. Angels are people who are servants of God and they are really bright and white and work for God everyday to protect Christians from Satan	OK, that's all fine, but that's not what I asked. I asked you what the difference was between ghosts and angels/demons.	0
Terrorists do not deserve the same rights and benefits as our citizens. Many of them are combatants and should be tried as such.  While I do not believe in leniency towards terrorism, I do believe that a person requires a fair trial and humane punishment for their crimes. Military trials very easily degenerate into show courts with torture, as we can observe with the number of US black sites in existence. Further, militant Islamists use our mistreatment of prisoners as recruiting material. If you don't believe me, read some of their newsletters.	Why should a person desrve a fair trial when many terrorists themselves have already confessed and take responsibilty towards their actions? Whether or not we mistreat prisoners is will still not prevent them from recruiting more terrorists and finally, the constitutional rights are for citizens and not terrorists.	0
I do not think I can do that, because of your presuppositions.	Huh ? Please elaborate.	0
Society has nothing in and of itself for it is a conglomerate of individuals and it is those people which posses morals.	These morals consist of a standards that have been recognized by individuals throughout history, with the obvious exceptions of various psychopaths. These people would recognize that killing someone without provocation or justification is immoral (it would most likely elicit guilt). These are instilled into people from birth, not developed as a belief system by children and adolescents as they ponder the surrounding world. In addition, modern neuroscience is revealing that there is a connection between brain activity and and morality, in a manner that opposes the claim that people are completely responsible for their own moral beliefs.	0
No. Time is an illusion that is in the human mind. Eternity and Infinity are the truth realities. Time and space are sort of the fabric of the 3 dimensional universe. Yet there are other dimensions in the universe. Ones that don't use time. The universe is expanding at a rate that can be measured, and the time it takes to cross a distance can also be measured. According some Near Death Experience stories, when a person dies, they can move from one place to another with a thought. It seems that even though time might not exist in the realms of higher consciousness, space still does. However, at some levels of reality, even space is an illusion. The universe has a size, and a shape, and it is expanding. But expanding into WHAT is a question of the day? Some sort of void, that lacks both space and time? We did not create time, but it isn't exactly the full reality either.	How can time be both an illusion of the human mind and at the same time be part of the fabric of the 3 dimensional universe?	0

"That is correct. He does. No denying that. But God has done everything he can to try to make this NOT happen. Think about it this way. You're driving along a road that you know has a 45 mph speed limit. You know it does but you still go 75 mph and end up in a head on collusion with a guy killing him and you survive somehow. You go to court and the judge is their and its the guys father. He has to charge you and he does but then the brother of the guy walks in says he'll take the charges for you, all you have to do is say yes and take a safe driving course. You yell out ""F--- no!"" And even go on complaining how the 45 mph sign should've really been a 75 mph sign. I hope you can see the analogy."	I was simply disputing what the other guy said that Satan is the big bad guy who condemns people. And, it looks like I was right. I can't believe that Satan doesn't do any torturing. That's such a popular belief, do you have any idea where it comes from? Your analogy is slightly off. It is more like you are going 45 in a 45. No one dies, but you are put on trial anyway because your great great grandfather trespassed somewhere. At the trial the judge says, there is nothing the court will do as punishment and you can go on with your life. Then a crazy guy walks in and says the son of lady justice who walked the Earth years ago can take the charges for you.	0
Fluoride is helpful for your teeth and it actually reduces cavities I know when I am at the dentist after they clean my teeth they put fluoride in my teeth and they said it would strength my teeth so I don't get cavities and I have never had a cavity in my life I always take care of my teeth. :D	Did you know in a international comparison, there is not signifigant differance between the amount of cavites in nations that use flouride in their water and the nations that don't.	0
"Racism can be racist though, and it usually is. If Chuckhades, for example, said something like: ""All blacks destroy cars""  Then that would be racist, wouldn't it?  It is also a stereotype."

"Historians put Wilson in the top 5, he imprisoned Suffragists, anti-war protesters, anti-draft protesters, socialist and signed the Federal Reserve Act which has ruined the worth of the dollar. Historians put FDR in the top 5, he put Japanese American citizens in concentration camps, let the USSR take half of Germany and Eastern Europe and dragged out the great depression. Just because some historians that work for PBS say ""this guy is great"" doesn't mean they are actually great.  And yes, Obama will go up there because he is black, I know you're going to put your hands over your ears, close your eyes and yell ""Its not true! Its not true!"" but it is, whenever you have the first leader of a nation that is of a different race/gender/ethnicity, they go down in history. Not claiming its right or logical, but hey, even if they can't find a way to make this guy look good, he will still go down as ""The First African-American President Ever"" so yes, it will have to with his race."	No, he's going to be up there for healthcare reform. It will save us billions and allow for a longer and healthier life. It's something we should have done when Nixon tried to do it. In the short term, he will get huge credit for not allowing this insane congress to push the U.S. off the fiscal edge and completely ruin our credit rating. But people like yourself who cannot accept that anything this president does is a great accomplishment will do as you are doing, say it's about color of skin.	0

It's true children can't choose their parents but parents can't choose their children either can they? I mean, obviously the parents would want good kids but they don't necessarily get that, so in that sense parents don't have to look after their children either right? And also, after parents do all that they did for you, it doesn't feel right to abandon them in their old age, if they were there for you their whole life, shouldn't we be there when they need us?	"You assume that parents are always ""there for [the child's] whole life"". That's not always true and not to the same degree. Your idea of a good parent could be vastly different from mine. I think you misunderstood why choice is important in the case of responsibility. Parents might not be able to choose what their children are like, but they can choose whether or not to have children at all (or raise children). That is where the claim to responsibility lies. Other than your feelings that parents shouldn't be abandoned in a time of need, what reason should a child look after their parents if they don't want to? Some elderly people have no children at all, so wouldn't you be more concerned with them? What about children who are abandoned by their parents in a time of need? That would be infinitely worse, wouldn't you agree?"	0
In America being a Christian is a struggle. People will always discriminate against you. Atheism is the trend now so Christians will face discrimination.	"How is Atheism ""a trend"" if 77% of Americans are Christians? According to a poll Atheists are the most mistrusted minority in the United States! I think what you mean by ""trend"" is increased popularity, I think all you want is for Atheists to be in the minority for the sake of a Christian majority so you can be content."	0
Kinect also does not require an extra controller as opposed to Playstation Move. It can be played completly by using your body and hands.	Admittedly, Xbox kinect is great. It's fun but there are some problems with it.  A lot of games cannot be played without buttons, which means the games for the kinect are very limited.  The PS3 move controllers do have buttons, however i've tried them and they aren't the best either for shooter games like Killzone. To make the game challenging and fun you'd probably play the Move, but it was tiring and difficult to aim, which also limits the gameplay with the Move.	0
Look, I'm not going to get technical, because there is no reason to. This debate topic is personal, and I answered personally, not with a mere compound of logic.

A dwarf can have a full sized baby, and a midget can too. Even if it is two midgets who breed they can still have full grown children. I agree on a common ancestor however our common ancestor is called neandrathol. Which implies it wasn't human. My argument is just stating we didn't evolve from apes. Apes are what are around today. (Edit: I was wrong Neanderthals were not a direct ancestor but we are closely related. Anywho, your rudimentary tree supports what I am saying anyway.)	A dwarf can have a full sized baby I just used dwarfism as an example to show how a mutation in one person doesn't mean the entire species evolves. Perhaps it wasn't the best example because, as you said, they can give birth to normal sized children, but I'm sure you get the point I was trying to make.  My argument is just stating we didn't evolve from apes. Apes are what are around today. You're correct, we didn't evolve from modern day apes, but we are related to them. They are loooooooooooong distant cousins. The only point I was trying to make was that just because one species evolved from another one doesn't mean the species they evolved from can't exist at the same time. If a group of humans eventually broke off from mainstream society and evolved into a new species, that doesn't mean all of the unevolved ones will die out, so they can exist at the same time.	0
Any time you make a decision, it's because something told you to, whether it's your brain chemicals responding or another person. God causes those chemicals to react/respond by aligning his creation to do so, therefor he is telling you to do it.  It's the same situation as a scientist controlling a lab rat.	Any time you make a decision, it's because something told you to, whether it's your brain chemicals responding or another person. Brain chemicals do not tell one to do something. They make someone do something. There is a clear difference between telling someone to do something and making someone do something.	0
How can anyone think their argument techniques or whatever it may be need improvement if you don't have the stomach to tell them? That's a B.S. reason to vote someone down right there!

I'm pro, of course. What else will we test it on, your children? How else will we make sure they're safe?	There are a number of alternatives that are more effective than animal testing. These include in vitro cultures, manufactured cells, cadavers, stem cell research, microdosing techniques, blood donations, and the neutral red uptake phototoxicity test, just to name a few.	0
Belief is mainly opinionated, I don't know that God is real but I still don't fucking believe in him!	Theists don't just believe in God. They know God exists. Maybe not literally, but try telling them that God isn't real. Their religious texts are enough supporting evidence for them. Same goes for Athiests. Their Bible is science, so to speak. Agnostics believe that either side may be correct but knows that either God himself is going to have to pay us a visit or we're going to have to die before we get an answer.	0
How do you know what true knowledge is and how is it identified if it is man made?  Not saying we know nothing, only we can't be certain on what we know.	Knowledge comes from experience. I know that actions have consequences because I have experienced the consequences of my actions. I understand that knowledge is very often viewed in too absolute of a sense, but assuming that there is no such thing as true knowledge, is an example of viewing knowledge in too absolute of a sense. We CAN be more or less certain of what we know. The truth that we can even be absolutely certain, and be wrong, is no guarantee that we cannot in some cases be absolutely certain and be right.	0
"A firmament that separated the waters from the waters. As if there was almost like an ocean above and an ocean below. THIS NEVER EXISTED.  The firmament is the sky............the sky would split heaven and the waters.......I mean it only takes a few seconds to think of that..... One being that theres no proof a god poofed anything into existence and another that the intense greenhouse effect it caused would burn up all life on the planet. What does the greenhouse affect have to do with anything i said? There has to be a slight greenhouse effect for life to start. Just not as much a Venus. So what does that have to do with anything I said? Also there is no conclusive evidence against and being like God. As for the incest thing it would never stabalize... 2 people literally cannot spawn 7 billion people over ANY length of time. It just doesnt work. Adam and Eve for example may have 7 children. 3 girls 4 boys. Thats three mates. They mate and have three more children each making 9 children. Repeat until you get to 7 billion.  As for the flood. It never happened. Where did the water come from? No explaination. How do you know? Were you there? No. Where did it come from? God maybe? If he exists he can make some more water. That isn't a hard task.  How did the saltwater or freshwater animals survive in brackish water?  There is no need for them to. God said take two of every kind of animal so grab two fish. Why grab all the species if their habitat will change? That is illogical. So grab two fish or primarily any kind (probably closets to him). Two whale would be simple. They dont have to be on the boat. Two ocean fish would be simple. They wouldn't have to either. Hopefully you aren't assuming God meant grab two of every species of animal. That would be crazy. Where did the water go? No boat of the size in the book can hold that many animals, their food, feces, ect. Um yes it could. Like I said grab two of a kind of animal not two of every species. Leave the whales in the water. Throw the feces of the boat like a normal person would do. Food would be easy because there would still be space.  Men dont live past 120 max EVER so noah was not 500 freaking years old.  Dude, stay with the context of the story. I don't care if he was just 20 and died. He lived for a long time. If God exists its all possible. And ultimately the sediment layers studied by geologists disproves it entirely not to mention that we have writings from other places in the world at the same time as the flood and they never mention it or died. I swear other cultures talk about a great flood. Sediment samples? You are dealing with God. Leaving a trace would be against his beliefs. Exactly. so how can anyone propogate that they know for a fact that it happened? It goes both ways. You can't prove of disprove it.  Im the creation of my mother and father and i know how it happened and that they both exist. The process was natural. Why should the creation of the universe be any different? Being a creation doesnt mean we CANT know. You mother and father a probably alive. Were you there to witness the creation of earth? How about your parents? Grandparents? Great grandparents? Ancestors? Nobody saw it. You can never know if it happened or not. Dirt came AFTER bacteria. What is dirt? Decayed plant and animal matter.  I was thinking more along the terms of just earth and maybe some water and with the right chemicals you can form something. Scientists have formed amino acids in a lab without dirt so I would assume it is completely possible. We cant have plants and animals living and dying so much that it created dirt before we even had bacteria. And bacteria werent even the first creatures. The first protein strain had to exist. An amino acid or something. Sure whatever you wanna say. I am sure it touched some dirt and by that I mean earth and water. We dont know how it happened exactly but from that point we have a really solid recreation of how life evolved from step one. Nowhere does it include or ever need a god or any supernatural force. Im not trying to be mean when i say this but you have no idea how evolution nor abiogenesis works... That's true. I don't waste my time on it because I don't like science. If they can't have an exact answer I don't want to hear it. Tell me when they make a legit discovery. Neither was I but i dont need to be. With science we can discover many things. And with logical thinking we can dismiss certain ideas. Combine the two and we have no need for a god. Hes out of the picture. No you just have people thinking logically while God is somewhere far away or something. Whatever religion deems him as. It doesn't delete him. It just ignores him. I dont need to think about it. Its entirely rediculous and ive also heard it tons of times before. Could a god exist? Sure its possible. But everything we know about the world. Every theory and law and finding all of it has natural causes and processes that explain it. Never once have we ever needed supernatural forces to explain something. So why should the beginning of the universe and planet Earth be any different?  Because it is Earth and the Universe. Its so controversial. If you didn't know what a firmament was I highly doubt you actually think these things through.  Occams razor. That says that it is more logical to begin with using the simplest explaination before moving on to more complicated ones. Simple Explaination: God Complicated Explaination: Science So what are you exactly saying? Its more logical to believe in God or something? And it is more logical and simple to explain the evolution of our planet and the universe according to natural processes that align with EVERYTHING else we know instead of assuming some supernatural force that goes AGAINST everything we know poofed it into being. Not to mention we have evidence for our explaination and theres zero evidence for a god doing it. A god could have just spawned the universe and walked away. Then you are just examining what the God did. It doesn't go against anything at all. It just examines the creation of that god. If you wanna call it that. I perfer the term INFORMED atheist. Informed? You didn't know the definiton for firmament so your credibility in my eyes has dropped.  I read and study scientific findings. I research things and read the works of prominent scientists and atheists and even creation scientists. I watch debates between theists and atheists to see whos side is stronger and i listen to people on here and debate with them. And every single time the atheistic side has come out on top. That's because most Christian debaters suck ass. I am sure an Atheist has been defeated above. There are still things science may never answer.  Every single time the creationist claim is destroyed by the REAL science.  Thats cool I guess? I mean I really don't care that much. I don't watch arguments. I do other things.  I wont ever say ""I know for a fact there is no god' that would be a lie. I dont know. but you dont know either. True.  And no priest or pastor or pope does either. And no scientists for that matter. But i will say theres probably no god. I dont think there is one. THat is my opinion formed after years of study and the study i continue to do. Theres a whole world of information out there for you to assess. I suggest you take a look at it and decide for yourself instead of having other people decide for you. Im not making accusations, just observations. What religion do you think I belong to?"	"The firmament is the sky............the sky would split heaven and the waters.......I mean it only takes a few seconds to think of that. I dont think you get it. The firmament isnt really the important part here, its the separation of the waters from the waters. They believed that there was a body of water sitting above the earth like an ocean. Not heaven from earth. An ocean from earth. What does the greenhouse affect have to do with anything i said? There has to be a slight greenhouse effect for life to start. Just not as much a Venus. So what does that have to do with anything I said? It has everything to do with genesis. If there was a firmament holding a body of water above earth then the greenhouse effect it would create would be so great that it would kill Adam and Eve and all the little critters God spawned into being because lets not forget: according to the bible nothing evolved. There was no effect to start life. It was god snapping his fingers and making shit appear. Fully formed humans and other animals would burn up and die if such an upper body of water existed.  Also there is no conclusive evidence against and being like God. THat was random...when did i ever say there was? Adam and Eve for example may have 7 children. 3 girls 4 boys. Thats three mates. They mate and have three more children each making 9 children. Repeat until you get to 7 billion. No! No no no no no! Its not that easy! This isnt a little math problem you can do. The genetic diversity would be far too small and within a few generations the inbred descendants would have so many complications they would die out. Its literally impossible How do you know? Were you there? No. Where did it come from? God maybe? If he exists he can make some more water. That isn't a hard task. Geology has disproven it as well as simple logic and common sense There is no need for them to. God said take two of every kind of animal so grab two fish. Why grab all the species if their habitat will change? That is illogical. So grab two fish or primarily any kind (probably closets to him). So now he needs to build fish tanks to keep fish in on the boat too? Makes sense. And if he grabbed two Pickerels lets say, and everything else dies. How do we have flounders and goldfish and pike now?    Two whale would be simple. They dont have to be on the boat. Again, missing the point of me specifying BRACKISH water. Whales that live in salt water would die from the diluded fresh water. Whales that live in fresh water (idk if there are any) would die from the salt in the water. Its impossible.  Two ocean fish would be simple. They wouldn't have to either. Hopefully you aren't assuming God meant grab two of every species of animal. That would be crazy. Well if the biblical creation is true then evolution is not true. If evolution is not true and he only grabs two of every kind then how do we have millions upon millions of different species of animals now? And even if he did grab one of every ""kind"" what specifies a ""kind""? What kind of animal is a horse? And a cow? Theyre both similar in many ways. but you cant only grab horses because then cows die and vice versa. A ""kind"" still has to be very specific and its still impossible to fit them all on a boat smaller than the Titanic. AND if were going by biblical literalists then Noah was 15 ft tall because of some pseudo science crap and likewise all the animals were proportional to him so thats like 10 foot long cows and shit making it all even more rediculous and we still havent gotten to the plants yet. Um yes it could. Like I said grab two of a kind of animal not two of every species. Define a ""kind"" and even then its still impossible. Leave the whales in the water To die in habitats theyre not suited for. Throw the feces of the boat like a normal person would do How long does it take to shovel thousands of pounds of feces i wonder? Food would be easy because there would still be space. There wouldnt even be enough space for half the animals...and Lions eat Antilopes and Wildebeasts. Animals eat eachother. How could you fit on all the animals, have them not eat eachother, and bring on thousands of feeder animals to feed the other animals? You do realize how absurd this is getting dont you? Dude, stay with the context of the story.  The context of the story is a magic man told a guy to build a boat and squeeze an impossible amount of animals on it for a magic rain that didnt happen!!! And IM out of context when mentioning the story ALSO says Noah was hundreds of years old?! WTF? I don't care if he was just 20 and died. He lived for a long time. If God exists its all possible. You just contradicted your point about staying in context. What is the context? And you left it by saying he may have been normal age, then negated that by saying if god is real anything is possible. What is your claim? Im lost.  And lets not forget that you still havent proven God's existence so we cant use that ""God can do anything"" scapegoat just yet. I swear other cultures talk about a great flood. Yeah they do. But many at different times. and they all lived through them. Places flood. It happens. The world flooding? not so much. Sediment samples? You are dealing with God. Leaving a trace would be against his beliefs. Oh yeah because why leave traces that would make convince people to believe in your holy book that you want people to believe in? How silly! God is a fucking moron. If leaving a trace is against his beliefs (which you somehow seem to know) then what the fuck is the bible?  It goes both ways. You can't prove of disprove it. Exactly. so how can anyone propogate that they know for a fact that it happened? Can you read? I know gods existence cannot be proven either way. HOWEVER, theists all the time propogate that they know for a FACT that god is real and they have infaliable proof and conclusive evidence.  And if were talking about proving or disproving the flood then i disagree because we have 100% disproven the global flood. Sorry You mother and father a probably alive. Were you there to witness the creation of earth? How about your parents? Grandparents? Great grandparents? Ancestors? Nobody saw it. You can never know if it happened or not. That's what science is for....we can test things and examine things that can lead to conclusions. You think that theres no traces left behind by the big bang? Theres background radiation and everything that weve mapped. We can investigate things. and ultimately the god of the gaps argument is still shit. Your whole argument right there is ""i dont know. you dont know. Therefore god did it"".  I was thinking more along the terms of just earth and maybe some water and with the right chemicals you can form something. Scientists have formed amino acids in a lab without dirt so I would assume it is completely possible. Sure An amino acid or something. Sure whatever you wanna say. I am sure it touched some dirt and by that I mean earth and water. Okay sure. Im not sure if you were agreeing with me or not but okay That's true. I don't waste my time on it because I don't like science. If they can't have an exact answer I don't want to hear it. Tell me when they make a legit discovery Wow. I dont even know what to say to that. So if your mom was dying of cancer and scientists had an experimental cure that wasnt totally exact but was in theory legit, you WOULDNT let them perform it on your mom?  Just because you dont like science doesnt mean it isnt correct and true. Sure, sometimes i find science to be totally boring but its factual. And you do know that wheras they cant say for 100% certain that they know how the universe began, they HAVE made a really good and accurate theory built upon legit discoveries right? They discovered the background radiation from the big bang. They discovered the sound of the radiation and recreated it. And so much more. Theories are built upon many legit discoveries.  No you just have people thinking logically while God is somewhere far away or something. Whatever religion deems him as. It doesn't delete him. It just ignores him. Whatever floats your boat. Either way he isnt needed Because it is Earth and the Universe. Its so controversial. Only because of religions. Only because it goes against people who claim they have all the answers in a world of religious people. It really isnt controversial at all.  If you didn't know what a firmament was I highly doubt you actually think these things through. I know what a fucking firmament is that wasnt the point i was making. And youre the one who just dismissed all of science because ""i dont like science"" so i highly doubt youve though ANY of what you believe through. Simple Explaination: God Complicated Explaination: Science So what are you exactly saying? Its more logical to believe in God or something? Noooo no no no you dont. Youve got it all wrong. At first glance ""God poofed it"" seems like the simplest answer. however it completely flies in the face of all scientific findings and basically everything we know. It totally goes against all laws of nature and physics and completely defies logic. It uproots all of science and the very nature and fabric of reality. That is not a simple answer. That is a total scientific overhaul. Now science is formulating answers that are totally consistent with the laws of physics and nature and we dont have to change anything we already have discovered to fit it into our knowledge. Its like having a square hole and a square block. it fits perfectly into the hole. But with god its like having a square hole and a truck to fit in the hole.  A god could have just spawned the universe and walked away. Then you are just examining what the God did. Except were not finding anything that points to a god doing it. And lets be honest, that isnt the god youre talking about. If that is the god that did it all then the bible still isnt true and nobody needs to worship him or anything.  It doesn't go against anything at all. It just examines the creation of that god. Lets assign every major scientific finding a number starting with one and going all the way up to 1,254,672. Now, the beginning of the universe/life is discovery #1,254,673. If discoveries 1 through 1,254,672 were all natural and consistent with the laws of physics and nature and eachother then isnt it the most logical thing to assume that the next one in line will be consistent as well? Especially if that one esentially gave birth to all the ones before it? Its completely illogical to assume that that one discovery is supernatural and goes completely against everything before it instead of being natural and consistent with everything.  Informed? You didn't know the definiton for firmament so your credibility in my eyes has dropped. 1) once again i know what a firmament was please see my actual argument. 2) Coming from the person who thinks 2 people can populate the planet in a few thousand years and that millions of animals fit on a tiny boat and survived a magical nonexistent flood and repopulated the earth once again. That's because most Christian debaters suck ass. That's what youve been confirming this whole time I am sure an Atheist has been defeated above Not in the debates ive seen. Sure i bet Frank Turek could probably beat some average joe atheist on the street but thats not really fair.  There are still things science may never answer 1) atheism does not equal belief in science. only the disbelief in a god. 2) i agree, but that doesnt make a god any more true or likely to be true Thats cool I guess? I mean I really don't care that much. I don't watch arguments. I do other things. Yet youre on a debate site. And you seemed to care enough to debate with me this long. and you seemed to care enough to claim that atheists have probably lost debates before. Id say you care. What religion do you think I belong to? I dont really care. i just care about the arguments you were making however ill take a wack at guessing. You seem to believe in a god so ill narrow it down to deist. And seeing how you tried to defend the bible and its claims and god so much ill narrow it down to non-denominational Christian. I dont think i can get any more specific with that so ill leave it there."	0
" because they think Atheism is the root of all evil proving my point Nope. The love of money is the root of all evil. Even says so in the bible. A true Christian would know that.   Second of all it is practically impossible to ""live in a godly lifestyle"" since their religion makes too many contradictions one of the reasons that I am an Atheist I feel so free of that bullshit! Contradictions? Most are scribe errors and translational errors like something contradicts in the KJV and then doesn't in the NIV. Its just the translator. Also we don't read the Greek or Hebrew so we can't tell exactly what it says until you study it and so far I haven't seen anyone who argued for a contradiction in those. Another thing is that some aren't even contradictions. People just don't understand it or don't take the time to think about it. For example the God of Anger and God of Peace ""contradiction"". If one thinks for a moment they will realize that that isn't even a contradiction.  Third of all their is in fact a poll that says Atheists are the most mistrusted minority as you can see in the video below. Highly doubt they are mistrusted. Say your an Atheist in public and you are fine. Say you are a Christian and people go against you. They even started taking of the little cross on the ""co-exist"" signs."	" The love of money is the root of all evil.  We don't know that love of money is the root of all evil it has not been proven, I was simply exaggerating peoples view on Atheism. Contradictions?

"I prefer to use the words evidence for instead of proof of but I agree with what you said.  I never understood religious people's problems with evolution either because they could so easily argue that no matter how things came to be or evolved over time- ""God"" gets the credit.

"Jesus said, that we are to ""Do violence to no man"" Luke 3:14. Jesus also said, ""Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."" Matthew 5:38-39. So my friends, show love, even to those that hate you."	Jesus there was talking about personal problems with people. such as bullies and neighborers, but God clearly states violence is an answer to some situations.   Exodus 20:13 had been incorrectly translated as “do not kill,” but it literally means “do not murder.” God has allowed for just wars throughout the history of His people. From Abraham to Deborah to David, God’s people have fought as instruments of judgment from a righteous and holy God. Romans 13:1-4 tells us to submit ourselves to government authorities and that nations have the right to bear the sword against evildoers, both foreign and domestic.    but of course this does not mean enjoy violence, the wisest man of all time wrote, “Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways” (Proverbs 3:31).  i used sources from this website since it said better then i could.	0

No it isn't! Does Snorlax have a BIG FOOT? NO. Hahaha. Does Big Foot live in a pokeball? According to the show broadcast on television, Snorlax appears to be a creature which sleeps a lot but apparently, it does not have a really big foot in contrast to its body size.	Snorlax is a huge creature, that is why it is very difficult to catch Snorlax with a pokeball. Big creature = big head, big body and BIG FOOT.  How do you know that Bigfoot does not live in a Pokeball? Have you caught Bigfoot yet? Given your style of logic equating similarities of two things to be the same, then yes, Snorlax is Bigfoot.	0

"First of all, ya morons, if we were debating on God's existence, we would have to accept that if he did exist, we would NOT understand his true intentions. We're human beings that are limited by the physical realm. God is supposed to be supernatural and powerful and shit. So saying ""if God does exist, he's an asshole for letting evil happen"" is admitting that you're an ignorant fool who isn't serious about reasoning. You missed the underlying point. If a god is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, then evil cannot exist. It's a matter of logic. The converse is true: if evil exist, said god could not exist."

Does it also include death? Pain? No. The theory goes that God created a perfect world, without pain, suffering, or Aids. When Adam and Eve (or, more accurately, Eve and Adam) sinned, such things came into the world. The idea is that when sin entered, we as humans (the caretakers of the Earth, according to Genesis) pushed God away from it all. Nature has since been slowly degrading, and the imperfections are causing our suffering.	When Adam and Eve (or, more accurately, Eve and Adam) sinned, such things came into the world. So Adam and Eve created a microscopic organism (aids virus) out of nothing? Are you sure you want to argue this?	0

Yes, please attention whore more. It is good for the site, I quite enjoy it, and it is super cool! Plus, I think there are some who stalk you on here (not like crazy...restraining order stalking), but good all in fun kind of stalking.	There's being relatively active, then there's attention whoring. They are two completely different things.	0
"Theologically it is bullshit. According to my dictionary the definition of believe is ""to feel sure of something"" therefor belief has to be active and shifting. If you do not know if you believe in God or not that technically means you do not believe because you do not actively believe in God therefor you are an atheist. Proving Apatheism wrong is even easier, you don't care if there is a God or not therefor you still do not actively believe in God and you know the rest."	I think you are misinterpreting what is meant by Agnosticism. Agnosticism doesn't claim to believe or not to believe God. The only claim Agnosticism makes is that whether God exists or doesn't exists is unknowable and therefore irrelevant. Agnosticism is thus an epistemological position, it's not a metaphysical position. Agnosticism is completely withdrawed from the actual content of the theism debate.	0

Uh, no it isn't. Having a rule that applies to everything, other than stated exceptions is not a contradiction.  (Read a book)	"You said, ""No religion can be logical"", then you go on to say that there is a religion that is logical. Scientology is a religion and it is logical.

No you are wrong on that a provision in the affordable health care act states that businesses with over 50 employees have to pay for their health insurance, do you know how many businesses that effects? 1% of businesses!

Murdered the mother of the child he raped, that is warranted for him to be sent to prison, and not be offered the option to leave the general population. The death penalty is a painless way out of punishment, but the things that will happen to him in prison, that is justice. They are going to rape him a lot and then kill him, that's what I'm trying to get at.	Murder should not be tolerated, taking the life of someone should face the ultimate penalty, death, taking away his life is the only justifiable act. Whether he is in prison or not, being in prison still gives him the luxury of living despite whatever may conditions he is given. Being rape and prison doesn't equate to murder.	0

You can't really regenerate when ALL your cells are destroyed.	According to some mythologies vampires can recover from near to total destruction, however I agree that is likely unfeasible. That said, the only way to ensure the total destruction of all the cells in all vampires would be to destroy all of humanity alongside them. The likelihood that all vampires (or even all humans) would be at the fully destructive epicenter of nuclear detonation is highly unlikely. Most causality would come from radioactive exposure, to which vampires would be immune due to their regenerative abilities.	0
She is right. Making Puerto Ricans learn the English language when most of them have only known Spanish all their life is more than it's worht. I know that if someone was telling me that the primary language in Texas was going to be Spanish from now on, I wouldn't be very happy. It's not as much have to learn the language(which is difficult in itself) as much as the fact that it takes away from the Puerto Rican culture. As she said, their language is a large part of the Puerto Rican culture and taking away their language could be hurtful to their culture. Not only that but it would be rather difficult and expensive to convert the 'state' to English. Any signs and stores would have to be changed to English. Imagine the expenses on the buisnesses. The amount of money that it would cost simply for a restaurant to change all of their menus to the English language would surely cost financial issues for the small buisnesses. So I agree that we should not make Puerto Rico a state.	I don't know where the statistics are coming from but i am pretty sure they are wrong.  1. English and Spanish have been official languages since 1902  2. English is taught from first through twelfth grade  3. 50% of all Puerto Ricans over the age of 5 speak English and Spanish  4. 85% of Post -Secondary school students speak English and Spanish  5. Federal courts and agencies use English  6. Local governmental affairs are conducted in English and Spanish  7. English is the language of Commerce  The information above came directly from a Puerto Rico goverment website.	0
You wouldn't happen to be a jackass would you? No, just your average high school student. My thought process is not flawed, it just did not contain any good sources of information and was a reply to your question off the top of my head. Well I would like to hear this good information. I can get more in depth if you want... After you sir. Speeding up the process is usually not a good thing when it comes to schooling, at least from my experience. Well that is an interesting claim. However anyone from the medical field must pass all tests in order to become anything in the medical field. These tests include ones where a professor is present and evaluating ( the important tests ), so if a student happened to cheat on all of his/her tests taken within the comfort of their home will more than likely fall into the less than 1/8th percentage of students who drop out or fail online courses. Procrastination to the point of failure is a sign of one who is weak of mind.	-Procrastination to the point of failure is a sign of one who is weak of mind.- Are we in Soviet Russia? Your average teenager hasn't developed mentally to the point of understanding consequence. In other words a student will more likely than not once in their life ( chances are many times ) will procrastinate to the point of bombing a project of test. Some learn quicker than others, however holding the ideal that one who procrastinates is a basic fool is a mistake on your part. -so if a student happened to cheat on all of his/her tests taken within the comfort of their home will more than likely fall into the less than 1/8th percentage of students who drop out or fail online courses.- Did you know that 39% of all statistics are made up on the spot?

What is knowledge but a condition of the intellect? It is a very strong belief which, like other beliefs, may be proven incorrect at some point. It's not that what you are saying makes no sense, but my perspective is that the difference between 1-4 is the degree of certainty, with 1 being the least and 4 being the most. 1. Suspicions 2. Assumptions 3. Beliefs 4. Convictions, facts, and knowledge	"A belief is something one's mind can possess, in the mind of the believer it is correct, but knowing humans, they have their own opinions. That belief may not be true in their mind. Meaning if knowledge is a belief, than knowledge would vary for every person, if knowledge is known in so many different forms of thinking and ideals how can we be certain that what is said is true ""knowledge."" All these creations of idealistic knowledge are assumptions because there isn't one solidification of knowledge."	0
When the clash is brought on (man wants a child, woman does not), the question is brought up( who has more say here?). While I feel the opinion of the male should be considered I ultimately feel that since it is her body she should have the final say. If she does not want a child, she will be holding it for 9 months to give to him, and get nothing out of that deal. Why is your opinion not as valid? Let me answer that with a question. Why should she be used as an incubation tube? It's odd, since they can't do a half way split ( like the story of Solomon), like with custody it has to be all or none do you agree to that much? If it has to be all or none, who's higher priority here? A man who wants a child but did nothing but ejaculated, or a woman who does not that has to hold the fetus for 9 months?	She has to be the incubation tube because that's the function nature assigned her if she didn't want to be pregnant she shouldn't have had sex. If you made a hard bed you still have to sleep in it as the saying goes.	0
"In a purely logical debate, it's rubbish to try to say ""why would God allow evil to happen?""

We're human beings that are limited by the physical realm. God is supposed to be supernatural and powerful and shit.

"You can certainly take the stance that the limited human mind cannot possibly comprehend the mind of an unlimited being. It's a very rational stance. But this if we're to have any serious discussions about God at all, we'll need to hide this idea in one corner of our minds, and just reason about God as best we can. I'll make an example. Take the theory of skepticism, which states that we know nothing about this world for certain. You might think you know what you look like, where you live, etc, but there's a possibility that you could be deluded. This is a pretty rational stance to take. But does this mean that it's pointless for us to attempt to gain knowledge? Should we just close down all our schools and universities, because everything that is being taught and discovered may well be false? Should we stop making any kind of decisions, because decisions are based upon beliefs, and any or all of these beliefs we hold may be false? No. While we should keep a healthy dose of skepticism in our minds, in everyday life we need to act as if we can know what is real and what is not, or else society simply won't be able to function. The same applies to religious considerations, where the ""we can't know anything about God"" is something like a localised version of the skepticism argument. Sure, it's good to have that thought somewhere in your mind; it keeps you humble and open-minded. But for practical purposes, when you're debating whether or not God exists, or just discussing or expounding the tenets of any religion that includes belief in an unlimited God, you need to act as if you can attempt to find out at least some things about God. Otherwise, the philosophers and scientists will have nothing to say about God except ""we don't know"", the Pope, priests, and pastors will have nothing to say except ""we don't know"", and the Bible will be replaced by a single line saying: ""Your puny mind can't truly know anything about God or what he wants you to do, so there's no point trying to find out. Just sit back and hope that you go to heaven. Good luck."""	0
"By saying that it helps ""managing our time and work"", I meant you can become more efficient by completing tasks faster and easier using Social Networking Sites. Yes, I do believe that Social Networking Sites help us save our time and here is the reason why:   If you have your group mates as your friends online, you don't have to drive up to the other end of the city to work on a project together. All you do is you go online and discuss it there. A conference is also a brilliant option for assignments that involve more than two people. This indeed saves a huge amount of time that could be wasted on the road. And faster you complete the task, more time you can have for your exercising and reading and many other things. Does is make any sense?"	I agree with u, but I think that without this, we a lot of time spend with computer...study, work! And would better if people do their project together (live), do you know as language of body? tit would be more effectively...	0
"That's stupid. Did you just write the first thing in your head? Schools are NOT any sort of government.  They are, however, being given money to by US, the taxpayers, in hope that they will do a good job of educating our kids. Students are minors. If you're suggesting that they have individual freedoms, i could easily say that was completely wrong. If you were right, then wouldn't teenagers be voting? If there was a representation of the students ""rights"", that would lie in the taxpaying parent."	"Are schools not mandatory coercive institutions that enforce rules(aka laws) against those who fall within their jurisdiction?  Most schools are better modeled as totalitarian governments rather then democratic ones. Thus students do not have rights, this is a horrible and ironic violation of what my country( the USA) is supposed to support. A good democratic government has a constitution as a check against mob rule, just to preemptively counter a likely counter-argument you'll make. Teenagers do have individual rights, they are however more limited. mid to late-teens should be able to vote.  Rights are natural, and are not dependent on who pays the taxes, you do not pay for your rights; they are innate. You may have to fight to express them, but they are inalienable. If you are an ""patriotic"" American, this should be something you agree with strongly considering it is one of the basic principles America is founded on."	0

"Of course, totally valid point. But this isn't my debate. If it was I would've already specified in the description as I did in my lag post. But also, these ""sins"" are the same for theistic and philisophical. In theistic satanism all these things are applied literally as teachings and sins, and in atheistic satanic philosophy they are a moral code and philosophic ideals. So you're really not valid when you say the thing about murder because it applies to satanism in all contexts. I hope this makes sense."	I see what you saying. But I see lust is not there nor is sloth or pride or greed, gluttony, or jealousy, wrath. So satanists allow the 7 deadly sins to be broken?	0
I agreed: I said what I said before you said what you said, but you were talking about how you felt in the past about me.

When you use the word imagined it refers to the past, so you insulted me with your imagination before I attacked you.	No, I called you a dribbling thing just now, that sort of stupidity, because there's a total twat at school who has a constant face like some gawking 5 year old.

What? Could you clarify, please? A gravity well does not merely move particles towards the center of gravity, those particles have their own gravity well which draws other particles inward towards them, and repeat this to infinity. Actually, they are. Most of the mass of the solar system (98%) is in the sun, which is made of mostly hydrogen and helium. The planets are drops in buckets compared to the sun. So why did all the light elements clump together in the middle to form the sun while the heavy elements stayed on the outside (orbiting the sun)? If I understand your question, hydrogen gas and helium are light elements and would be drawn together. The mass of iron, nickle, and other heavy elements would draw their own matter towards them. These heavier elements are much less common, like you said drops in a bucket. They wouldn't form as big a mass as the sun, but be drawn towards it. I imagine that at some point they formed orbits. Cosmology and astronomy are not my specialties but from what I understand of physics and what I have read it would probably be along these lines. However orbital mechanics is where I find myself really leaving my expertise comfort zone. If the planets are in stable orbits (they are), than the dust that made them had to also be in stable orbits (as orbit doesn't rely on mass). Which means that in our stellar dust cloud with the makings of our sun in the center, the dust 'orbiting' would fly off into interstellar space because the sun wasn't massive enough to keep them in orbit. And before that, the dust would have to be swirling at fairly specific velocities with enough matter not swirling to be able to get pulled in to make the sun.  I have to imagine that the sheer mass of hydrogen and helium would form a body with enough gravity to draw in those particles even slowly. I'm a little out of my element in imagining the formation of orbits however, because this isn't my specialty. Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus aren't made from hydrogen and helium like the Sun and Saturn are. They're heavier elements, like methane, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. Yes, but these elements are lighter than iron, nickle, silicon, etc. I did. Writings systems are simplified (from pictographs to sound-symbols), and words are simplified (from fully-conjugated verbs with implied nouns to non-conjugated verbs. That's right, but we have also gained increasing complexity in the number of words, and dialects within a body of language. Sure, it's grown more 'casual', but also more simple. Especially Ebonics and like dialects. I don't know if I would call them simple. There are divergences in dialects within those dialects, and new vocabulary and rules form each decade. Some of them borrow from other languages, adding grammatical complexity.	A gravity well does not merely move particles towards the center of gravity, those particles have their own gravity well which draws other particles inward towards them, and repeat this to infinity Okay. Yes, I can see that things like that would happen. But say you have an abnormally-shaped gas cloud in space. (I'm assuming most clouds aren't spherical.) The particles on the edges would be pulled strongly toward the center, while the particles in the middle would be pulled weakly toward the center, while the particles in the center would be pulled nowhere. This is based on the location of every other particle to the individual particle in question. No, as the cloud collapses, say, unevenly, some particles would slow down because there are now particles 'behind' them because the one went too quickly. Some would speed up as those 'behind' it (behind is away from the center of mass of the cloud) moved to the front. As this goes on, the cloud should collapse until the particles are like a liquid. If I understand your question, hydrogen gas and helium are light elements and would be drawn together. The mass of iron, nickle, and other heavy elements would draw their own matter towards them. These heavier elements are much less common, like you said drops in a bucket. They wouldn't form as big a mass as the sun, but be drawn towards it. I imagine that at some point they formed orbits. Hydrogen and helium are the lightest elements (that's why a helium balloon floats [where as hydrogen balloons explode--see the Hindenburg]). They would be forced away from wherever the center of mass is, because all the heavier things (iron, nickel, oxygen, methane, carbon, gold, lead, etc.) would be moving to the center. It's like this: If you put a helium balloon on a bus and the bus suddenly accelerates quickly, the balloon would actually move forward. The heavier air is pushed to the back by inertia, pushing the balloon forward. The heavier elements are much, much fewer, yes, but that would mean what little there were should be dropped to the center much faster than hydrogen and helium. By the time the sun ignited, the heavier elements should all, or nearly all, be in the sun, not orbiting it. orbital mechanics is where I find myself really leaving my expertise comfort zone. Orbital mechanics is interesting. I enjoy it, but then again, I enjoy calculus as well. I have to imagine that the sheer mass of hydrogen and helium would form a body with enough gravity to draw in those particles even slowly. I'm a little out of my element in imagining the formation of orbits however, because this isn't my specialty. I'm not exactly sure myself. It gets tricky with a changing orbital mass. Yes, but these elements are lighter than iron, nickle, silicon, etc. Yes, they are, so I guess that part would be true. That's right, but we have also gained increasing complexity in the number of words, and dialects within a body of language. Number of words are a valid argument, but dialects ... I'm not sure. Most dialects tend to be less complex than their parent (Ebonics from American English, American from British, British from Saxon, etc.)	0

"First of all literature is the written word, that is novels, plays, essays, histories, biographies, etcetera. Literature is an important facet of most modern cultures but it is not necessary. You claim that all scientific discovery requires literacy, frankly this is not true. Scientific discourse began long before writing was invented. In fact one might argue that science, religion, and philosophy are integral to the human condition: man has always asked the difficult question of ""why?"" and as a species we show no inclination to stop. From this central conclusion we can deduce that literature is not necessary for science to occur because if science is a universal constant among humans then the fact that not all cultures have literature requires that science be independent of literature. Further literature has always and always will depend on science to provide it with the changes in culture and thought process that allow writers to create new works from new perspectives.  Does this diminish literature's value? No, literature is relevant to society in that it gives a perspective on ourselves, who we are and what we were. It gives us a means to record information more reliably than through an oral tradition. But science allowed literature to exist through the invention of writing materials and to make claims otherwise is both misleading and dishonest."	Just to say, firstly, clearly you haven't seen the point of my post. Science does NOT create literature, because Literature is an entirely different thing. Science depends on Literature in order to deliver an understanding, because how else could we know about something which occurred hundreds of years ago? Science can seem to be of unmatchable importance, but how does one come to understand it without Literature. I will rest my point there. Ask yourself, if it takes Literature to create a proper understanding of things, how could it be called 'less important?' Anyone can say that science has invented 'writing materials', but since when has Literature been defined as simply writing?  So, take time to understand that Literature is not the creator of science, as i have not said anything of the sort, but it is the cornerstone of understanding. What good is science without an understanding?	0
There is another argument : recently, scientists from the Institute of Public Health in Oslo (Norway), surveyed 2803 children, found that babies who were born by caesarean section, 7 times more likely to have allergic reactions to foods. Scientists believe that this is due to the peculiarities of the microflora of the intestinal tract. Cesarean section is a delay in the development of intestinal microflora, and this leads to impaired digestion processes.	I read that children born by cesarean are much more physically and mentally strong because during birth they aren't exposed to stress passing through the birth canal and don't feel pain caused by contractions.	0
Ever heard of a lion who never killed a deer and ate it? Lions kill deer because they have to to survive. Every heard of a human who never ate an animal? Yes, but the vast majority do, regardless of the fact that we are not naturally meat-eators. Again, name one species that actively tries to protect another species.	Yes, but the vast majority do That is not an argument for your survival of the fittest theory.  name one species that actively tries to protect another species. That doesn't matter. What matters is that other species do not attack out of greed and selfishness. Whatever they do, they do for their survival. Whatever we do, we do out of greed and selfishness. We harm the environment and animals and that's what we have got - a damaged planet and so many species on the verge of extinction.	0

Belief A = Denying women the ability to have abortions; A pro-choice person would state Belief A as immoral. A pro-life person would state Belief A as moral.  Both of them are interpreting the belief, but both have a different belief about if it is wrong.  What do you mean by moral arena? Do you mean they use the same moral beliefs to determine if it is right or wrong?  The arguments for and against abortion appear to use different standards, the for usually uses women rights, well the against usually uses something about religion and life being precious to god.	"Belief A = Denying women the ability to have abortions; A pro-choice person would state Belief A as immoral. A pro-life person would state Belief A as moral. In a manner of speaking. Both of them are interpreting the belief, but both have a different belief about if it is wrong. What do you mean by moral arena? Do you mean they use the same moral beliefs to determine if it is right or wrong? A more accurate statement in that debate would be ""Women have a moral right to have an abortion"" or the converse. Both are reflections of one, another, each supporting its respective view. Ethics would be the determination of whether an abortion is correct in each circumstance in which it may be applied, or the determination of which methods are proper during a procedure."	0

The question is totally loaded. Lumping all evolution into a single definition is simply wrong. I believe in micro evolution, that is, evolution within a species. Macro evolution, on the other hand, is something which I don't believe in. Macro evolution is evolution outside of a species.	Micro-evolution and macro-evolution are one and the same. The only difference is the scale at which they occur. Micro-evolution occurs over a short period of time, Macro-evolution occurs over a long period of time. If you admit that micro-evolution occurs, and if you admit that life has been around for a long time, the only conclusion one can make is that macro-evolution has occurred. To say otherwise is to defy logic.	0

I know all about the laws in these states constitutions. For the most part these laws are not enforced, except in cases where the person running for office publicly declares they are atheist. (Don't ask, don't tell.) Do this and the world would be a better place. As I stated, no true Christian would go after another human being. There will always be some radical group trying to cause trouble, just a fact of life. Mark Twain said, If some one goes after your name, ride out the storm. Don't feed it with a response. (paraphrased)	"Atheists are discriminated against especially in many southern states like Mississippi and Tennessee! PS I do not think ""Don't ask Don't tell"" Is a good solution all that does is surrender to obvious discrimination."	0
Evolution has a substantial scientific consensus. Scientists from many, many different fields have contributed to evolution in an effort to prove it's validity. They have succeeded, though there are doubters. Evolution asserts that one creature, over time, becomes a superior creature, different in many regards to it's progenitor.  Radiometric age dating has confirmed that the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years. This has been confirmed from meteorite material. 3.5 billion years ago, unicellular life evolved; it took nearly three billion years for multicellular life to become commonplace. Fifty million years later, extremely basic forms of ocean life develop, and after another fifty million years they move onto land. By 250 million years ago, reptilian life becomes commonplace - the most famous of which are the dinosaurs; fortunately for humans, they go extinct over the next millions of years. Four million years ago, an Ice Age killed of most of the larger mammals. Many now-extinct creatures thrived during the Pleistocene era - 2.5 million to 12 thousand years ago - including, perhaps most noticeably, the Woolly Mammoth and the sabre-toothed tiger. Homo Erectus also evolved during that time period, roughly 1.8 million years ago. By 200,000 years ago, there is evidence of the existence of an archaic form of Homo Sapiens, the genus to which we belong ! Forty thousand years ago Cro-Magnon began migrating to Europe and by 25,000 years ago the Neanderthal became extinct. It was not until the last 10,000 years or so that modern Homo Sapiens developed.	The question is totally loaded. Lumping all evolution into a single definition is simply wrong. I believe in micro evolution, that is, evolution within a species. Macro evolution, on the other hand, is something which I don't believe in. Macro evolution is evolution outside of a species.	0

Your point about FDR is spot on, he's consistently considered one of the top presidents because of the very successful programs he put in place after the great depression. Not sure if that was your point, but that is a fact. His polio had nothing to do with it.  And as far as the debt ceiling, you are fooling yourself if you think that this tea party group wouldn't love to go off the cliff. It is the left's campaigning on the subject which has informed the majority of the idiocy going on in the House and has forced their hand. But the amount of gerimandering which has taken place has made some of these seats so right wing and so safe for the looniest of these clowns, that they don't really need to worry if 85% of the country is against their hostage tactics concerning the debt ceiling, because the constituency they've created is almost entirely made up of that remaining 15%. Finally, I never said that there was not a special place reserved for the first black president. Of course there is and there should be. If your white you can be the C student son of a governor and your portfolio can consist of nothing but bankrupting oil companies and baseball teams, and you can get elected twice. A black man needs to be a Rhode Scholar, Harvard honor student, nearly spotless personal life, and people will still spend the next four years questioning dumb shit like where he was born and accusing him of everything they can think of. So yeah, there's that. But even without that his accomplishments would still propel him to a high position among American presidents.	"Your point about FDR is spot on, he's consistently considered one of the top presidents because of the very successful programs he put in place after the great depression. Not sure if that was your point, but that is a fact. His polio had nothing to do with it. A few old historians wrote books depicting FDR as the social program president, but to the general public talking about him goes something like this ""The guy who served four terms? Didn't he have polio or something?""

A picnic table is no definite thing.

I have never advocated big business, that is your perceptive. You advocate practices which lead to big business and fight policies that would be against their interests. Big business forms due to demand. Business operates as a voluntarily exchange between two parties of good and services. McDonalds or Ford has every forced me into a exchange of their goods or services. They grew out of the demand by consumers and lack of multiple competitors. The entity that forces into service is the government, and if I don't pay for their services, I go to jail. Why do you think big businesses have few or no competitors? They lobby (buy political favour) so that competition cannot exist. They become bigger because of this entanglement with government. Wrong, that is consequence of big business and big government working in collusion. No, government has no incentive to help businesses for personal gain. What happens is that big (or growing) businesses offer money to political campaigns, and endorse politicians, in addition to other tactics. A perfect example are the big Intellectual Property owners. The internet is a form of competition to their business model. It's a disruptive technology. What do these owners do? They buy favours from their governments so that now police inspect our hardware for stored songs and videos, and now people who copy songs and movies face lawsuits, and are especially vulnerable as these companies lobby for greater legal tools to acquire the personal habits of people they intend to sue. It doesn't end there, because technologies that can bypass digital restrictions are being made illegal, all for the sake of protecting the interests of these big companies. The government would probably rather keep its nose out of this, but thanks to these extremely wealthy companies, and their lobbying, digital downloads are being treated like drug trafficking. The government didn't step in early on and choose to make these companies bigger with regulations. It was at these companies' behests.	You advocate practices which lead to big business and fight policies that would be against their interests. Wrong, Laissez-faire policies encourages the elimination of big business by allowing more competitive markets emerge in all industries instead of oligopolies or monopolies.	0
"I am not trying to prove anything. It is a simile. I propose that Satan is like the warden. I don't need evidence because my opinion is formed on well known tenets of Christianity. If you disagree please point out what part you need evidence. a) God makes the rules people have to live by. b) God sends souls to Hell for not following the rules described in ""a"". c) Satan is in charge of punishing people in Hell. I am applying critical thinking. I am taking what I see and making a conclusion. Please describe how I am wrong. Just because I don't sight the exact source of my knowledge, you can't dispute the whole argument. You have to pick the parts that you are disputing since I provide the reason why I believe it."	You say you've based this on Christian tenets, but it's missing a few details so it's incorrect. The rules were made to be broken; that is, the rules could never have been followed in the first place. This is supposedly to assert that humanity is a poor, wretched thing that needs a god to kill part of himself and raise himself up so that he can glorify himself and save us miserable creatures. By your current abc, you are saying every human being goes to hell no matter what. Which directly contradicts Christianity's core tenets. Also I would like scriptural evidence that Satan is a 'warden', as well. That might help your case. Also, I can dispute your whole argument if you do not cite your sources, provide meaningful evidence/sources, etc. That's how a court system works. They don't accept hearsay or speculation as valid testimony, so why should I.	0
"Well my point is the concept in the constitution says that congress should respect all theological and since Atheism didn't really exist was it was not brought up. But as far as we know about the constitution it says nothing about how Atheists have no rights, the same damn book says ""all people get equal protection under the law"" and since Atheists were not brought up at all in the constitution they would be in that group of people with equal protection under the law."	Actually equal protection under the law in fact if you read it it goes a bit in the opposite direction. It originally allowed for slavery and held that only land owners had rights and since it was illegal at that time and for quite some time afterwords for women and blacks to own property outright I any such language resides in that document at leas with such an absolute meaning as you are asserting. Lets not forget that most of the founding fathers were slave owners. As it turns out equal protection under the law as we think of it today is a very new idea.	0

The many many government backed atrocities will never match anything that any Muslim true or fake has ever done. Look at the Roman Empire who invented crucifixion, the worst way to die. Look at Stalin. Look at Hitler. People are varying views all united in hate. Oh, and look at George Bush Jr. who started bullshit wars based on torture, lies, bad intelligence, and daddy issues.	Islamist many time stated that they want to kill all non-Muslims that means that want to kill more than 5 000 000 000 people, they just aren't capable to so. US, Russian, Chinese governments are separately capable of killing everyone on this planet in less that 40 minutes. are you sure that government is worst one?	0
As far as I see it, hate the player, not the game. If paedophiles are harassing young children, then get the police to go round and throw them in jail, don't ruin the internet for the vast majority that don't want to fiddle children. Collective punishment is restricting and unfair. Misuses of the internet should be dealt with individually, not collectively.	I get what your saying but how are they meant to find the player in today's tech savvy world when there is all those wonderful things to hide your self behind? By having some one monitor the internet I think would be a improvement but I didn't say I support down right control. If some one became to heavy on what was on the internet all kinds of back routes and dodgy things would start. Also could you explain better how his is a collective punishment when what the main goals are to clean up the frankly filthy shit that is on here sometimes including the bastards who do these crimes against not just children but men and women of all ages and entire families sometimes. Think of it as lunch break at a lose school, able to ruff and tumble and do some stupid things but there is still a teacher to stop the bullying and make sure people act civilised.	0
USA has a great impact on the world. There were different kinds of wars in south Afrika, such as Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. Europe and USA influenced their ceconomy and political stability. Most people think that it was made by USA to take their natural resources, as these countries are rich with them. I agree with them. The main reason is fuel as it stimulates economy growth.

God did create marriage because it all started when he created Eve from Adam and God has to be the third member of a marriage or it will crumble. Also, God does exist because he created the world and he created humans and how is he not worthy of worship? What has God done to deserve any less.	1) God did create marriage because it all started when he created Eve from Adam and God has to be the third member of a marriage or it will crumble. The argument loses credibility as soon as you mention Adam and Eve because as we know the genesis account of creation is false. So if you meant Adam and Eve from the bible (which I'm sure you did) they never existed. Also God has to be the third member of the marriage, first thing is there is no good reason to believe there is a god and the second even if there was one what makes you think that without him marriage would crumble? 2) God does exist because he created the world and he created humans  This is an assertion and not backed up by evidence. Evolution tells us how humans arose and this is backed up by plenty of evidence. 3) how is he not worthy of worship? What has God done to deserve any less. Well although I would say the God of the bible does not exist, if he did he would definitely not be worthy of our worship for the following reasons: i) The God of the bible called for the genocide of the amalekites, Canaanites too name a couple. He also killed children because he was angry with the Pharaoh ( He hardened the heart of the Pharaoh so he would not let the Israelites go). ii) Your God in the Old Testament justifies slavery, the killing of homosexuals and the murder of people for imaginary crimes such as witchcraft.  iii) Your God sends people to hell to be tortured for an eternity for a finite crime ( This disgusting idea came in the new testament).  iv) Your God created us, knowing we would sin and then couldn't think of a better way to forgive our sins then to send his son down to be tortured and brutally killed. If God is the one who forgives sins he could of just forgiven them rather then do that disgusting thing. That is 4 reasons why if your God is real, he is not deserving of any worship.	0

Not everybody deserves a chance at a higher education. Only the best should be chosen - not to be chosen so that they have ethnic and religious diversity. I would avoid any place that boasts of ethnic diversity - obviously they can't be expected to be the best. The best would chose people based on their credentials.	Everyone deserves a chance to succeed. The chance to succeed is what makes america great. In todays world success is equal to knowledge. America needs strengthen it's educational system so that everyone can get the credentials they need to compete in our ever growing global community. We need to educate more people with better educations, we need educational reform to achieve this, and that is a liberal platform.	0

"If a communist is putting forth a ""capitalistic stance"" he may very well be consistent with the writings of Marx, in the communist manifesto Marx mentioned how the communists and the democrats of his age should be aligned under certain circumstances.  Being polygamist, monogamist, serial-monogamist, polyandrous, etc in a state that values relationships is the state not having values antagonistic to a range of diversity. Thus state values are not necessarily antagonistic to diversity, and in this case that means diversity is not necessarily antagonistic to a state's values. meaning the state is not causing much inner strife or civil unrest which would make a community weaker. Thus diversity does not necessarily weaken communities in that regard.  I added /tested because tested and challenged are synonyms and I wanted to make the meaning Clear. If a idea goes unchallenged, it goes untested."	"Karl Marx =/= communism. Just because Marx mentions something about aligning communism and capitalism doesn't make then complimentary. But even if it did, this would only serve to show the strength of ideology when diversity is cast aside.  If the state values relationships then any relationship, regardless of if it is mono or poly, does not diverge from the state value. They diverse from each other, absolutely, but it means as little as having different professions if the state doesn't care. Besides, not specifying which type of relationships are approved of doesn't strengthen the state, it just doesn't weaken it. ""Tested"" and ""challenged"" are not synonymous. Especially not the way you meant it. This is an expost facto argument as if you really felt they meant the same, you would have only listed one of them.  If one's ideology is challenged by another person's ideology, it doesn't necessarily mean it is wrong, since it hasn't been tested. If it is tested and fails, only then can you be sure it fails."	0
God judges and sentences based on morality Your morality is flimsy, you said your God was just, so he can do whatever he wants without caring. In fact, you fail to explain why God is just in the first place.	"God's nature is just. As He says, ""I am who I am."" God is ontologically love, and justice, and mercy, and grace.

Territorial status is meant to be a transitional step to usher in a permanent status, such as statehood or independence. Made in 1952, the territorial arrangement it was meant to serve as a transitional step to something greater. This current colonial status does not allow Puerto Ricans to vote for the President of the United States. Puerto Ricans do not have representation in the U.S. Senate and no voting representation in Congress. Instead, the 4 million U.S. Citizens of Puerto Rico only have one Resident Commissioner who cannot even vote on the House floor. Therefore, Puerto Ricans have no say in the making of the laws and statutes that apply to them.	You're not Quentin, there's no way you're right. I mean come on, this is ridiculous. Let's get real.

i think comparing racial segregation to differences in the concept of marriage is a bit crass If they're similar they are similar, it can't be helped. To be honest i'm sure large numbers of people are marrying for implausible reasons to secure visa's and such so yes people are marrying willy nilly regardless of the governments apparent strict policing of how much couples 'like each other' Yet you claimed that it should be kept sacred. How is the sacrilegious sin of marrying for greed, in any way better than marrying someone you love, that happens to be the same sex as you?	they're not similar though they would only be similar if gay people and straight people were made to live apart it is outlandish to compare the two and i don't think marriage should be sacred i don't believe anything is 'sacred' my point was never that. as i mentioned i am an atheist i don't believe in sin. i was merely posing the idea that enforcing such laws on the church is not secular and that forcing the church to accept outside ideologies could be deemed unfair	0
"The Euro zone collapses, nixing the Euro from the market. There is no indication it will completely collapse, though some of the countries like Greece are in for a long long recovery. Some countries are improving nearly on U.S. pace though, most of the strong ones like Germany, England and France.  Asia controls almost all of our debt, and they will want it paid in full. It's really sad that the right continues to spread this blatant lie for the sole purpose of ginning up fear. The fact is we control most of our debt. Here are the facts about our debt: 1. Most of it is debt we owe to ourselves, not to foreign countries, and this makes our debt situation much much different than most of Europe and nearly every other country in the world. 2. Asia can't ask what small percent of our debt we owe them all at once because their economy depends on us. There is no Asian country that can survive financially without the U.S. Consciously doing anything to ""destroy"" our economy would hurt them worse than us. Plus, we can actually pay all of that debt pretty easily. 3. While the trillions number and the ticking clock are all super scary and make everyone want to pee pee their pants, the truth is that number is around 42% of our GDP... our yearly GDP. That is the lowest debt to GDP ratio of any first world country in the world.  Debt is not now and never has been a real problem. Might it be someday? Maybe if our GDP drastically decreases, but on the list of things affecting the U.S. economy, our debt is toward the bottom."	Now Im just saying what others have stated. It does not reflect my opinion on the matter. And I'd like to see your sources. Mine were from Elliot Wave.	0
"Time is not a property of the universe. Time is basically an illusion, it does not really exist, if there weren't that which enable change there would be no such thing as ""time"". Structurally our universe is made of matter and energies which react and affect each other, which causes them to change their location, their consistency, etc. There's no ""time"" anywhere. Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed. I'd say time is change, of everything. But then why call it ""time""? Also then time would not apply to only our universe, as not only here happens change (assuming there's more than just this universe). Humans created time. Even though it is useful."

You do realize that all of your morals have come from religions, don't you?	HA! So I'm sure before Christianity everyone just killed everyone and had a great time of it! No. I was born with morals, just like everyone else. I don't get my morals from religion. I don't need religion to tell me what's right and what's wrong in life. You get a three year old and give it a hamster. That three year old has never heard of God or Jesus before, yet it knows that killing the hamster is bad. You can rant on about your religions to me you're not going to convince me. I know, for a fact, I did not get my morals from religion. I am an atheist, and I have had morals since the day I was born, and I will have them until the day I die.	0

It's not even about offending people to me, I am naturally polite person (well socially at least, otherwise I'm a bit of slob XD) and I feel happy holidays is more courteous, it is a personal choice not to walk around on eggshells, or not to avoid offending anyone, not to be politically correct or as if I am fighting for a principal, but merely because it makes more sense to me, and seems socially more sensible.	0

Civilian Courts have a 100% success rate in convicting terrorists - which consequently is higher than military tribunal courts. It also taks away a recruiting tool, and allows us to maintain the moral high road on the world circuit. Which we used to have before Bush and Cheyenne decided war crimes were cool as long as it's done under an American flag.	Civilian Courts do not have 100 % success rate in convicting terrorists because information is available to the media that can be useful for terrorists, many serious charges are broken down to less serious charges and also, security concerns becomes one of the greates factor. Terrorists (and i am not referring to islamic terrorists) has long been placed for trial before a military tribunal, so what makes these terrorists now different?	0

"Portraying women in a way that makes us love them isn't really victimizing them. Look at muscle magazines with dudes with HUGE FUCKIN' ARMS. No one's complaining about how it victimizes men. Anyone who complains about this shit just has too much time on their hand and they want to feel relevant (and, very possibly, they're an unattractive female who's envious). What do women in magazines do to the male mind? They create a conversation piece: ""dude, check out Megan Fox on the cover of Cosmopolitan, I'd so bang her"". If that magazine never existed, we would still be talking about how we wanna bang Megan Fox (even though she's a dumb whore who can't act for shit)."	No offense and not trying to make you feel like an idiot or anything but the only reason nobody complains about the men is because dudes with really big arms or the ones on the magazines as you say, are really gross not attractive at all it makes me sick to my stomach.  Personally I don't want to date a guy who can't touch is face... also just because someone has an opinion doesn't mean that they aren't attractive or have too much time on their hands.  granted I do have extra time on my hands after work and exercise but! ...

1) Culture. If the country that has banned guns doesn't have crime or guns under control how have you shown that gun control works. How do you explain the low crime rate of the Swiss when everyone has guns? b) A majority of gun owners don't use their guns to shoot anyone. 2) Tell that to the Japanese in WWII. 3&4;) The stupid half of the country wants greater gun control when it doesn't work (Chicago, Washington D.C.) and the smart half isn't going around taking away EVERYONE'S rights when a very small minority were hurt in a single event, especially since the action being proposed has failed multiple times. Just as long as you are on the side doing the oppressing, but as soon as they turn on you, don't look at us.	1) The vast majority of crime is not gun homicide, in any country, therefore the Swiss can have a very low overall crime rate while having a high gun murder rate. b) Er OK, 100% of non-gun owners don't use their guns to kill anyone. 2) The Japanese supported their government right to the close of the war - are you suggesting if they had all been toting side arms they would have overthrown Tojo and made peace? All evidence suggests they would not. 3&4;) If you won't accept international comparisons showing that having lots of guns in a country leads to lots of murders, how about internal US statistics showing looser gun laws = more gun deaths: <a href='http://www.democraticunderground.com/10022167036'>http://www.democraticunderground.com/10022167036  You can't play the 'culture' card there, and within the US it will be harder to enforce those differences as there are no internal borders and guns can move from gun-nut to liberal states more easily, but still you can see the correlation. San Diego eh? You should be more sensible, California is blue isn't it?	0
How does change help society when it was apparently working before?	How does change help society when it was apparently working before? The history of modernity is itself the story of the constant victory of liberalism over conservatism.

I can think of a lot of instances where violence comes in handy and should be encouraged. If you witnessed a man raping a woman (or a child, another man, a goat etc.) and clubbed the rapist in the head, I'd say you handled the situation properly and should be commended. If a child defends himself against a bully by punching him/her in the face, he/she should be admired, not punished and scolded for being violent. Violence is natural, like fire. Fire can be both desirable and undesirable. It can be incredibly destructive or enormously useful, violence is the same way. When you defend yourself against a mugger, a bully or a rapist you are not only helping yourself, but you are helping the bully, the mugger and the rapist to reconsider their actions and approach to life. This, in turn, helps society as a whole. Violence can be a wonderful thing.	In order for something to be appropriately labeled violent, it must violate something. As I see it ,that something is rights. To relate it to your allegories, the rapist and bully lose their right to be left alone the minute they violate someone else's. Therefore the use of dangerous and even deadly force can be consistent with an uncompromisingly non-violent philosophy. You just have a poorly developed idea of what violence is. Your welcome.	0

"News: can often be provided quicker via internet. The fact that most news is archived means I can access it at any time. Easier access to a wide variety of perspectives. Social networks: can be annoying, but allow me to keep up with old friends who have moved away. Dating sites: Not my cup of tea, but they work nicely for some people. My mom and step-dad met through a dating site.  Information available: the possibilities are endless. Plus it is much more efficient to research online than rummaging through the limited resources found at libraries. Other: wide variety of entertainment. Also provides access to self-assessment. For instance, you can find out if you are tone deaf without having to leave your room (although I suppose you could argue that this fits under the ""information"" category.)"	News, you have to be kidding. Today we do not get news, just drama. Broadway cannot produce a show like the media puts on.  Social networks, aren't they for cackle hens? So much of the information on the Internet is disinformation. Not facts, but opinions. What is in print, is at least consistent. Most information on the Internet is not reliable.  Entertainment means nothing to me, I have in search of knowledge not games.	0
I disagree with this statement. I think it is enough to have only a few days for break off. Sometimes people may have vacation for month but feeling of relaxion zero. The first reason that i disagree with the statement is that, it is not convinient for employee.The week vacation release reproductivity of the work. I suggest to give a few a days but every months.I thinks it`s better for employee and employer. For example for Kazakhstani workers there is no need to have a week holiday because there are so many holidays during the year. It`s for about one half month if we collect the dates of the holidays. The second reason time and money that spend for week holiday.Legally the company must pay for it and it`s not beneficial for them. The third reason is now we are living in democratic country.I think there is no need to repeat the Soveit Unions mistakes. I mean when Soviet Union paid for each worker for holiday flight, food etc.. Finally, there became huge economic gap which let Soviet Union to collepse. It`s not benefical for state. I think it will be easier make the same beaches and entertainment near the working office or area, to economize time and money.	In some case you are right but I`m afraid I disagree with you . In particular, almost everyone now has a right to four weeks paid holiday. I think people should have a holiday even more than week because people are not a machine they need some time for restoration. Firstly everyone should have a holiday in order to distract from work to visit some countries learn culture and extend knowledge. Moreover if we think deeper it's also beneficial for government it may reduce divorce rate. As we know the majority of divorces is when people do not spend much time with family, so that they need holiday to spend their time with their family. All of us spend a half of our life by working, of course it is beneficial for us but by overworking we miss many thing in our life. Therefore I think people should have a holiday even more than a week.	0

Then god still created humans capable of free will and choosing evil. If our biology is at fault for our flaws, and god is at fault for our biology, then god would be responsible for our actions since he gave us the ability to choose evil.	That does not even make sense...We are not perfect beings,we will not be perfect until we are take into God's arms once more. God made us imprefect because he sent us here to learn. If we were perfect then there would be no need for learning or to be here.	0
You just are not able to imagine how islamic women are different from other women. It is like earth and sky. If you don't know it, how can you argue about how they are happy? All things what you said are just little part of this religion. The true meaning of it is not to wear hijabs, to pray five times per day and other things. They just do these things not only because they must to do it. They express their beliefs and love to their religion by doing these things. The main meaning is to understand what they do indeed. What they feel by doing these things, what are their attitudes on it. Moreover, the main thing to worship to ALLAH by the whole soul and by the whole love of your heart. That's why everything depends on sincerity of worship of women.	"My entire family is made up of Muslims and I don't think we're any different from any other people. We believe in different things, and we place our hopes in Allah, but how is that any more different than a devout Christian praying to Jesus or loving Mary? Why does this only apply to Muslim women anyway? Why not other ""People of the Book""?"	0
"Trying to redefine a term to mean something it doesn't is not an improvement. The term atheist comes from the Greek ""a theos"", literally ""without gods"". It is just any person who lacks a belief in deities. End of list."	"Trying to redefine a term to mean something it doesn't is not an improvement. Sometimes a words meaning is confused by a poorly written definition. When someone is asymptomatic, we don't say they lack a belief in symptoms, when someone is apolitical we don't say they lack a belief in politics, when someone is asexual this doesn't mean they don't believe in sex. Some atheists may understand very well the reality of what gods are and believe gods exist AS psycho-socially constructed absolute authority figures. They understand they exist, but don't personally regard any of them to be worthy of worship, that's what makes them atheist.  It would seem simple to categorize theists as those who regard one or more beings as being worthy of worship, and atheists as those who don't regard any beings to be worthy of worship. Not all atheists are SO metaphorically challenged that we don't know what the word god refers to in reality. Theists worship their gods and anti-theists speak up about the worst gods they know of saying ""certainly gods such as these aren't worthy of worship"". Some atheists aren't philosophically opposed to the worshiping of gods like the anti-theist variety atheists are, and even entertain the possibilty of themselves worshiping a god should they themselves become aware of one they find to be worthy.  The term atheist comes from the Greek ""a theos"", literally ""without gods"". It is just any person who lacks a belief in deities. End of list. The term cannot be understood without knowing what a god is. One cannot know what a god is, without believing they exist at least in some manner."	0
There is not an 'anything goes' to anything. To each privelidge we have a responsibilty, and that responsibilty in this case is to allow more dignity to our prey. Killing as a demonstration is wrong. You should kill only to survive. I was horrified by this video as humans have a debt of honour to horses and blatantly spitting on that debt... well, it's so human, isn't it? I am ashamed to be of the same race as that man. May he have his throat ripped out by a rabid tiger.	So harsh for a human to a human. You are that man whether you believe it or not, at least on some level. He's obviously more X, Y, Z and less X, Y, Z, than you. He's the same DNA as you.

"Do you seriously consider suicide to be an easy action?

It is easier than the drama the person is facing now. Or they believe that it is easier- that's why they do it.

I agree strongly with this statement, it would seem as if the United States were seeking more ground for expansion or you can say power hungry if you will. The country is afraid of being viewed as an enemy and this will strengthen their fear.	"One could also say that America is a power hungry, world domination seeking country based on the war we are fighting right now. It is not ""power hungry"" as you say if they country is already in a sense ours to begin with. They follow our governing customs almost to a t. Power hungry can only be used to describe our country when it comes to forcing our policies on other countries who want nothing to do with us. If Puerto Rico did not want to be a part of us, they would not map their way of governing, and ultimate political goals after our own."	0
It looks like this argument is being favored by folks that think in terms of their personal programming, I simply wish to speak in present terms. I do not offer dreams of what could be. I simply ask people to become aware of the way racial and cultural differences are NOW. If there is ever to be any solution, it will occur in the NOW and not at some far off, imagined point in the future. I predict that white people will become a minority in the near future. You can claim that you are fine with that, but I bet you won't like the results in the long run. I dare any white liberal to walk a few blocks in any predominantly black city.	"Done it, a friend of mine lived in a predominately black neighbor hood, my ex's sister's boyfriend was black, as is her current. I Also drive through little Mexico and sit around a bunch of Indians 5 days a week and my lab partner is from hong kong. 4 nights a week I work in a diverse group as well,well there I regularly talk to a black man and a women of Indonesian heritage. One owns a business well the other has her MBA, and I'm more or less a ""red"".  If I walk through a predominately black neighborhood and find I don't like it, it doesn't have to do with the pigmentation of the inhabitants.  Fact of the matter is, Diversity makes us stronger NOW. The different cultures and backgrounds from the various groups and people Mention above have had a profound impact. For example at work we're not all asking for the same days off because we all want to go to the geek convention because were not all geeks, resulting in most of the workers not being upset that they were unable to attend and thus not under-performing; resulting in a stronger work community."	0
First of all no one can know really what most people think. Many people have doubts about religion, but that is why we have faith. Faith helps us get through hardships that we face.

Prove what to you?! You give me some solid proof that it DOES! The proof I have is that, basically, there is no religion to have given me morals. And trust me, there is much more solid proof showing religion doesn't exist as appose to a bunch of brainwashed morons who believe on walking and water and all that crap!	"Prove what to you?! That you did not get most of your morals from religion. Somewhere in your bloodline is religious followers who passed down their morals. Maybe you think you received your morals from society... well where do you think their morals came from?  You give me some solid proof that it DOES!  How about a college education on the subject? How about the fact that I have brought my studies on the topic beyond college? You do understand that I am not arguing that religions are correct, don't you? I am trying to get you to realize that although you are an athiest, your life has been greatly influenced by religions.  the proof I have is that, basically, there is no religion to have given me morals. That isn't proof. Although you are an athiest, it wouldn't hurt you to learn more about the world you live in and study some religions. You don't even understand what you oppose. Buddhism is a good example, I left you an argument a few days ago on the topic of whether or not Buddhism is a religion. I did this because your original response was so far from the truth, that I just could not ignore it. And trust me, there is much more solid proof showing religion doesn't exist as appose to a bunch of brainwashed morons who believe on walking and water and all that crap! There is ""solid proof"" showing that RELIGION does not exist? Well damn, I'd like to see that! The argument you are referring to is whether or not GOD exists, not religion. We don't know if he exists or not. I don't care how many Big Bang Theories you have heard, that still does not mean that a higher being does not exist. Same goes for Christians or any other religion, they can preach all they want but it does not convince me that what they say is correct. That is why I am in the middle, an agnostic, just as everyone should be. Does God exist? I don't fucking know! That's not what this debate is about. I'm telling you that your life has been greatly influenced by religion. Do you celebrate Christmas? That is a Christian holiday. Maybe you just put up a christmas tree... Well that was a pagan tradition. How about marriage... Your parents are/were married, correct? You plan on getting married right? Well you can thank religion for that. The wedding ring tradition dates back to Paganism as well. For adultery to be commited, one must be married, correct? So if marriage is a religious tradition and adultery is seen as immoral, wouldn't that mean that this view stems directly from religion? This is just one example. Can you still honestly deny that religion has not affected your life and some of your views?"	0

Cod and Halo are geared towards anyone over 18. Video games in general have no target audience. Anyone can play. MLP is targeted SPECIFICALLY at girls ages 1-10ish. If not that then just females in general. When a grown fucking man watches something like that, how can you not call homo? I'm all for women's equality. Play video games, drive monster trucks, own companies, play football, whatever. But grown ass males should NOT be watching My Little Pony. And at the very damn least, not watch it and then wonder why everyone is calling you a faggot. I'm not homophobic. I just personally see this as a stupid, childish, and in some cases disturbing act that needs to, at the very least, stop being praised.	Actually if you did any research or even knew just a little bit about what you are talking about you would know that the target audience of the show is the entire family. The show is made so that a daughter, a son, a mom and a dad can all watch TV and enjoy what they are watching together its made SPECIFICALLY for all ages.	0

Being of sound mind, I realize I'm likely to get as much enjoyment debating a person who advocates the murder of children and refers to them and their mothers as property as I would playing chess with a person afflicted with Down syndrome, but still I have to ask; what is your methodology for determining what parts of the Bible are metaphoric and what parts are not?	Do you not understand the intent of the law. It's a punishment for adult children who do not take care of their parents when their needy, and instead devote all of their money to themselves. When did I say I advocated murder or chattle slavery? I stated at the time that Jesus was around this was the cultural norm. You just twist other people's words around because you know that they're correct.  As to the Bible, things that are outside our realm of knowledge, like the Creation. 6 days didn't mean 6 24 hour days. God didn't necessarily create everything like that. And the apocalyptic prophesies like revelation and Ezekiel should not be taken literally.  I feel like I'm playing chess with someone who tells me to look away, and then puts their rook on the seventh rank, and then looks me dead in the eye and says it was there the entire time.	0
It was God's will and plan for your grandfather's life it was the same thing for my grandma. My grandma died last year the day after Christmas and I prayed she would stay alive but she didn't but God took her because it was His will and it was time for her to go and be with Christ I still miss her but she is having a more wonderful time in Heaven because she is with God and its better than this corrupted and evil world.  I know that I will see her in Heaven when I get there.	"THAT IS BULLSHIT. Stop with that ""God's will"" bullshit. Thats a sham, an excuse, a lie. A way christians weasle around their MANY unanswered prayers and make excuses for their nonexistent god not doing a DAMN THING.  Now its great that you think shes up in the clouds happy with your sky daddy in peace, thats all fine and dandy and warm and fuzzy. But think, what if she didnt believe in god? or what if she lied, or stole? I know that if thats the case then you think she went to hell AND DESERVES it. How do you know she isnt there?? Not so happy to think about now is it? Thats what you make people feel when you say their friends and family could potentially burn in hell. Isnt that sickening to you?

The reference made to an atificial process is invaluable in this debate. The fact that the fetus is formed from sperm and then merges together with the ovum is in no way artificial.  The fluid that is feeded to the fetus from the mother causes the fetus to depend on survival for this fluid, right? So therefore if it has no life then how come it depends on survival? Don't living things depend on survival? They have a brain which retains their identity but they do not have a brain that is conscious and has full functions. And to be within the confines of personhood one has to have a brain that is fuctioning as that of a normal brain. A fetus brain is not fully formed but when compared to a person in coma, both are at the same level because there is the absence of the elements of personhood. This point i made is in reference to a Supreme Court trial which later became an ammendment to the law. For the person to lose the elements of personhood, he has to lose the higher functions of his brain which is to be self aware, conscious, have a level of understanding and to be able to touch, feel, think or move. Also the other element of survival as determined by scientists, doctors and even to a Supreme Court trial, is losing the ability to depend on themselves for survival. Thank you for making that point. A brain dead person CANNOT RECOVER BECAUSE THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN AND A IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE TISSUES AND STEMS OF THE BRAIN. IN A FETUS, THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND NOT DAMAGED AND ALSO THERE IS A NORMAL FLOW OF BLOOD TO THE BRAIN. IN THE FETUS THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND IN GOOD HEALTH BUT IN THE PERSON THERE IS NOT ANY HOPE OF FURTHER GROWTH AND ALSO RECOVERY. A FETUS IS BORNED AND NURTURED BUT A PERSON IN COMA CAN'T. If DNA does not matters then maybe they should stop using DNA to identify criminals because DNA identifies a different human identity which is used in the case if a father or mother wishes to identify their child, born or unborn. DNA gives it identity, not a brain. A brain performs and or control basic body functions. Even to doctors will attest to this. As far as i remember cloning has to do with copying DNA (HUMAN IDENTITY) and using it to create another. In the case of human sexual reproduction, the sperm is ejaculated out of the father into the canal of the mother where the process of fertilization takes place. This process takes place within the human body and not out of the human body. So i am of the opinion that the reference you are making is insignificant because the the fetus is formed from a natural process and not from an artificial process.  Firstly a fetus has DNA which a cancerous tissue does not have and also a fetus has organs which cancerous cells do not have. A fetus is developing into a human person. Can cancerous cells develop into a human person? Cancerous cells kills by feeding off of the body whilst fetus develops into a person.  The fetus cannot give consent i agree but what about the millions who are murdered without getting their consent?	The reference made to an atificial process is invaluable in this debate. The fact that the fetus is formed from sperm and then merges together with the ovum is in no way artificial.  Natural and artificial are irrelevant here. Humans can reproduce asexually given certain conditions, that is the point, reproduction. The fluid that is feeded to the fetus from the mother causes the fetus to depend on survival for this fluid, right? So therefore if it has no life then how come it depends on survival? Don't living things depend on survival? I did not say it had no life. I said it had no personhood. They have a brain which retains their identity but they do not have a brain that is conscious and has full functions. And to be within the confines of personhood one has to have a brain that is fuctioning as that of a normal brain. A fetus brain is not fully formed but when compared to a person in coma, both are at the same level because there is the absence of the elements of personhood. This point i made is in reference to a Supreme Court trial which later became an ammendment to the law. Consciousness is irrelevant here. What matters is that the brain stores the identity. A foetus has no identity yet. Thank you for making that point. A brain dead person CANNOT RECOVER BECAUSE THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN AND A IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE TISSUES AND STEMS OF THE BRAIN. IN A FETUS, THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND NOT DAMAGED AND ALSO THERE IS A NORMAL FLOW OF BLOOD TO THE BRAIN. IN THE FETUS THE BRAIN IS DEVELOPING AND IN GOOD HEALTH BUT IN THE PERSON THERE IS NOT ANY HOPE OF FURTHER GROWTH AND ALSO RECOVERY. A FETUS IS BORNED AND NURTURED BUT A PERSON IN COMA CAN'T. We don't care what a foetus MAY become, what matters is that at the moment of abortion it is on equal level with a braindead person. Actually less because a braindead person has a developed brain. If DNA does not matters then maybe they should stop using DNA to identify criminals because DNA identifies a different human identity which is used in the case if a father or mother wishes to identify their child, born or unborn. DNA gives it identity, not a brain. A brain performs and or control basic body functions. Even to doctors will attest to this. Uniqueness of DNA doesn't matter. Pay more attention. As far as i remember cloning has to do with copying DNA (HUMAN IDENTITY) and using it to create another. In the case of human sexual reproduction, the sperm is ejaculated out of the father into the canal of the mother where the process of fertilization takes place. This process takes place within the human body and not out of the human body. So i am of the opinion that the reference you are making is insignificant because the the fetus is formed from a natural process and not from an artificial process.  DNA stores only genetic identity, the brain stores personal identity. This is why clones are different people. Again, artificial versus natural doesn't matter. Firstly a fetus has DNA which a cancerous tissue does not have and also a fetus has organs which cancerous cells do not have. A fetus is developing into a human person. Can cancerous cells develop into a human person? Cancerous cells kills by feeding off of the body whilst fetus develops into a person.  Cancerous tissue has DNA. It doesn't matter what a foetus COULD be, it matters what it presently is. The fetus cannot give consent i agree but what about the millions who are murdered without getting their consent? A foetus is not a person. It doesn't matter that it may one day be a person, it only matters that presently it has as much personhood as a tumor.	0
Nummi, you are just using an example of a disrespectful thing that the religious can say- that is not always necessarily said by all Christians.

Bullcrap. What debate on here has ever been settled? Everything gets recycled again, becuse people dont want answers, they want to argue.

That does not mean that real debates are not meant to achieve real answers. We are arguing because you are trying to cause unnecessary trouble, that's not what this is really about.

I disagree. I'm an English teacher in Puerto Rico and have lived here for more than twenty years and let me tell you 80% of my students do not speak English. At most, 20 percent speak English and that's because they at one time had lived in the United States mainland. Go to any government office here on the island and the clerks will speak to you in Spanish. All transactions are conducted in Spanish. English is spoken more at tourist attractions--hotels, fine restaurants--but rarely is it spoken in other domains of life. Puerto Ricans are very proud of their Spanish roots and the Spanish language and when asked, the majority will answer that they are Puerto Rican, not American.  So even though it is true that both English and Spanish are recognized as being official languages of Puerto Rico, that is just on paper. In reality, Spanish is the first and primary language on the island.	I understand what you're saying, but who ever said they would have to learn to speak English if they became part of America?	0

Shops still have the right to refuse entry to black (or white) people and some still do. Bad business yes, but perfectly legal. I personally have no problem with the site.

I already said If we can agree nobody should take just the word of a self-appointed intermediary (clergy) on what god wants for you, then really your only source is the Bible. For a religious person that is the worst possible way to practice their faith, in my opinion. It takes the word of god (or the message of allah, or what have you) and warps and adulterates it into some random, puffed up morons opinion even though he doesn't know anything more about gods will than you do. No, if there is a message to be had in the Bible individuals have to read it for themselves to figure it out.	Yeah, but tell me how many people actually read the Bible cover to cover... ;D	0
"They've done some very odd analyses, and as it turns out, there should be anywhere from 10 to 1 million ""advanced"" civilizations in the universe at any given time And yet it is all conjecture. There is not even proof that a single 'civilization' exists aside from Humanity (if we can even be called a 'civilization'). And it is very unlikely that aliens have visited, If they exist, then why not? Isn't there quite a bit of evidence to suggest that - if the do exist - they have visited? because although we may seem primitive to them, Why would we seem 'primitive' to them? there is fair reason to fear that if we do not kill ourselves ""If we do not kill ourselves""? I believe it to be a matter of 'when', not 'if'. we may become advanced enough to destroy them If we can destroy ourselves now, then why are we not currently 'advanced' enough to destroy them? so they'd want to get rid of us NOW, while we are not as powerful. Why do humans believe that everything unknown is a threat? Androids, aliens, etc. Since we're not under invasion, aliens don't know we're out there.

"Devil's advocate position noted, disagreement as follows: Suicide is a consequence of fundamental changes in both brain chemistry and brain structure, resulting in a distorted view of reality and self that makes suicide seem like the only actual option available to a person.

If any entity is truly to ""blame"" I would point my finger not at the victim but at the society that persists in its ignorance and stigmatization of mental illness and its failure to produce an even remotely adequate system of mental health care and treatment.

"First, way to totally avoid my first point. How do you respond to the dilemma of inherent margin of error? ""Each person doesn't do their own interpretation. Ever here of different religions?""

And, by-and-large, I have more respect for them than those who gather in glassy-eyed flocks with people who view them as little more than dollar signs.

Currently, U.S. companies doing business in Puerto Rico do not pay taxes. If Puerto Rico became a state, they would have to pay taxes. If there's no economic incentives for those companies to stay there, they will leave. If they leave, it would be an economic disaster for Puerto Rico.

"I fail to see how any of this provides evidence for God. The existence of God is not contingent on the veracity of Evolution. Nor has it ever been. This argument is so riddled with errors I can only list a few of the obvious errors. 1. Disproving evolution does not Prove Intelligent design 2. Disproving Evolution does not prove God. 3. A lack of vestigial organs (if there was) in humans does not disprove evolution 4. Living transitional species do not disprove evolution. 5. Complexity does not equate with 'design' 6. You must prove there there is a designer before you can assert anything as it's design; which is the opposite of what you are trying to do. 7. It only appears as if we have only ""pure"" species because we do not yet know what they are transitioning towards, if anything. 8. Humans actually do have a few minor vestigial structures."	1. Disproving evolution does not Prove Intelligent design Have you ever taken geometry? A lot of it is using logic to prove things. But sometimes it's impossible to prove something head-on. You have to take the counter-proof and try to prove the opposite, see that this is impossible, and then use that to prove the first thing from a side angle. There's also this ideology: If there are two solutions, and one is proved to be false, than the other, no matter how unlikely, has to be true. So, yes, disproving Evolution does prove ID. 2. Disproving Evolution does not prove God If it is eventually proved that live couldn't evolve on Earth, that it was 'designed' or maybe even seeded here by an alien something, than you're just pushing the origin of life to some other planet. But if life couldn't evolve on Earth, than it most likely couldn't evolve elsewhere, which means there has to be a god (in this case, God) that created it. 3. A lack of vestigial organs (if there was) in humans does not disprove evolution How not? Evolution is so complete and so perfect that there are no leftovers? It seems there should be something that serves absolutely no purpose, and thus, does not benefit survival nor not benefit survival, and, thus, it'd still be around.  4. Living transitional species do not disprove evolution. Not by itself, but it would seem logical that there would be certain things still evolving into other things. (Not that I think something evolves from a horse to a giraffe, but that they should be going from fish to amphibian, amphibian to reptile, reptile to bird, etc.) But we see none. 5. Complexity does not equate with 'design' Complexity on such a scale as life usually equates with design. Modern computers (even the very first computers) are massively complex, and have been designed. Watches are complex, and are designed. You can even tell an arrowhead, which is very simple, has been designed and created. When archaeologists find an ancient pot, they assume somebody designed it; they do not speculate what type of asteroid-lightning combination would be needed to form such a thing. 6. You must prove there there is a designer before you can assert anything as it's design; which is the opposite of what you are trying to do. If you prove it's designed, you imply a designer. 8. Humans actually do have a few minor vestigial structures. All the present 'vestigial structures' either have functions (e.g. the appendix) or can be explained via Creationism (e.g. the ear muscles, wisdom teeth, etc.) After sin entered the world, and the world's systems began to decay, I would expect some things to loose their function, like the ear muscles. Wisdom teeth can be explained thus: God made all things vegetarian in His perfect world. We have since lost that vegetarianism, and, thus, lost the benefits of wisdom teeth.	0
"No, he's going to be up there for health care reform. It will save us billions and allow for a longer and healthier life. It's something we should have done when Nixon tried to do it. Yes, just as FDR went down for Social Security, not being the four term guy with polio. I would argue that the health care bill will do more harm than good, but that's an argument for another time.  In the short term, he will get huge credit for not allowing this insane congress to push the U.S. off the fiscal edge and completely ruin our credit rating. Ugh, how have you not caught on yet? Seriously, every time there is ""debt crisis"" or ""fiscal cliff"" congress waits till the last second. Why? Because they can use it as a threat. They won't go over the cliff, politics is about getting elected and the second the media says ""Congressman Alex Smith made us go over the cliff"" their career is over. Its also beneficial to the president because he/she can act like they saved the day. Its all a big show for the uninformed. But people like yourself who cannot accept that anything this president does is a great accomplishment will do as you are doing, say it's about color of skin. As I said, you would put your hands over your ears and close your eyes. Stop acting like people function they way you wish they would and recognize that they function like this: There is a special place reserved in history for the first different race/gender/ethnicity leader of a nation, that's just the way it works, I'm not claiming its right but that's just the way it is. Even if he did achieve great things, saved the economy, was a peace maker and made America better, at the end of the day, regardless of what else is there, the thing that is going to stick is ""first black president."" If Sarah Palin was elected as president, regardless of what she would have done, she would have gone down as ""first female president"" and would have gotten a few extra pages in school text books."	Your point about FDR is spot on, he's consistently considered one of the top presidents because of the very successful programs he put in place after the great depression. Not sure if that was your point, but that is a fact. His polio had nothing to do with it.  And as far as the debt ceiling, you are fooling yourself if you think that this tea party group wouldn't love to go off the cliff. It is the left's campaigning on the subject which has informed the majority of the idiocy going on in the House and has forced their hand. But the amount of gerimandering which has taken place has made some of these seats so right wing and so safe for the looniest of these clowns, that they don't really need to worry if 85% of the country is against their hostage tactics concerning the debt ceiling, because the constituency they've created is almost entirely made up of that remaining 15%. Finally, I never said that there was not a special place reserved for the first black president. Of course there is and there should be. If your white you can be the C student son of a governor and your portfolio can consist of nothing but bankrupting oil companies and baseball teams, and you can get elected twice. A black man needs to be a Rhode Scholar, Harvard honor student, nearly spotless personal life, and people will still spend the next four years questioning dumb shit like where he was born and accusing him of everything they can think of. So yeah, there's that. But even without that his accomplishments would still propel him to a high position among American presidents.	0
Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.	"Ok, so, you're saying, since you've never ""seen"" an ape (which is the wrong animal, again) evolve into a human, and never seen God create a human, God wins this debate? So, just because we haven't proven we're from chimpanzees, gives grounds to say God made us? There's a huger spectrum out there. And again, I'll say, the theory of evolution isn't that humans are from chimpanzees; it's just an idea because our DNA's are closely related. Because, you're right, there is no proof of THAT. But there's proof of evolution itself. And it has nothing to do with creationism. This is the ignorance in today's society and it is merely all about ""science vs. religion"" which is again, two totally different things that shouldn't be combined as much as they have been."	0
Saudi Arabia is currently hosting an international conference about inter-faith relations. They have even invited Israel to attend. A few years ago, Saudi Arabia brokered an Arab League deal to recognize Israel in exchange for Palestinian statehood. The country may have its flaws, but they are also active for peace in the world.	They want a global law to punish blasphemy – a campaign championed by the 56-member Organization of Islamic Conference that puts the rights of religions ahead of individual liberties. The lofty-sounding principle is, in fact, a cleverly coded way of granting religious leaders the right to criminalize speech and activities that they deem to insult religion. Instead of promoting harmony, however, this effort will exacerbate divisions and intensify religious repression. Saudi Arabia is one of the world's worst abusers of religious freedom. The king couldn't hold this conference at home, where conservative clerics no doubt would purge the guest list of Jews from Israel, Baha'is, and Ahmadis. Holding a session on advancing interfaith dialogue abroad is a pale substitute for hosting it in the kingdom, where the message of respect for freedom of religion and belief is most needed.  Dialogue is no substitute for compliance with universal human rights standards. The UN and every world leader attending the special session should be demanding an end to severe violations of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government permits the public practice of only one interpretation of Islam. This forces the 2-to-3 million Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and other expatriate workers there to leave their convictions at the border, since non-Muslim places of worship are prohibited, non-Muslim religious materials risk confiscation, and even private worship is affected by the strictures. It also violates the rights of the large communities of Muslims who adhere to Islamic traditions other than the one deemed orthodox by Saudi clerics. In the past two years, dozens of Shiites have been detained for up to 30 days for holding small religious gatherings at home. One Ismaili, Hadi Al-Mutaif, is serving a life sentence after being condemned for apostasy in 1994 for a remark he made as a teenager that was deemed blasphemous. The alleged crime of apostasy, in fact, can be punished by death.	0
The basic concept of each and every religion is associated with god.Islam is more logical Because its teachings in the holy book are not changed.logic of Quranic verses usually proves to be true for example god has created universe in 6 days which means he created world in six equal periods of time.in Quran he told that he created milk from blood which means in mammals milk is absorbed from blood.

in which case shouldnt civil partnership suffice That's one of the arguments that was raised when people proposed separate but equal facilities for black people. Yet we know, from history, how well that turned out. It'd be okay, if the 'equal' portion could really be upheld, yet it rarely is. what is marriage but just a label associated with churches? You know, you are so correct. Yet why are marriages, something associated with religion, enforced and ruled over by law. Maybe people should just be able to get married willy nilly, no matter whether they like each other or not, no matter whether they can support each other or not, so long as they meet the church's requirements. Seeing as this isn't the case, and law protects, and governs marriage, gay people who are also protected and governed by law, should be included. i understand there are some legal differences but fuck gettin married anyway I actually agree with you here. The whole 'married' label should just be erased. People should just be bonded if they absolutely need to get to gether, but when things get labeled, things get heated.	i think comparing racial segregation to differences in the concept of marriage is a bit crass To be honest i'm sure large numbers of people are marrying for implausible reasons to secure visa's and such so yes people are marrying willy nilly regardless of the governments apparent strict policing of how much couples 'like each other'	0

1) a) Ah, countries that have always had lower murder rates still have lower murder rates. England's murder rate has gone up since they have had gun control. You can't just compare them across, America has always been more violent, but the murder rate has been going down lately and we don't have gun control. b) You didn't address my issue, so it seems I am right there. Let's go with your ridiculous scenario. A guy walks in on his wife and she is having sex with another guy, but he doesn't have guns. Ok, they get away and the husband is perfectly happy and everything is fine ... NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! He hunts that bastard down eventually and cuts his throat. Just because revenge takes time doesn't mean it won't happen. 2) You have no point. I can't vote for taking away my guns AND giving money to the government for defense because then there is no chance for me. I either vote for both or vote for neither, but I would like the countries defense to be strong against other countries. 3) I misread you statement earlier. The word amendment implies it can be changed, not that it should be changed. You have provided no such reasoning for changing an amendment let alone the one that allows all the others to exist.	1) The UK's murder rate has gone up since 1937? How is that an argument? It raises all manner of red herrings (e.g. has the detection rate increased or the actual rate of murders). Are you trying to suggest that an American is simply more murderous than a European? How does that explain the law abiding Swiss? Give me a counter theory - if it is not the availability of firearms, what is the cause? b) So you are saying there is no such thing as 'the heat of the moment' you have never done anything you later regretted? Yes a proportion in that situation will go on to commit the crime in cold blood, but the majority will not. 2) You can vote for whatever you like, but you cannot use the argument 'I need my guns in case my (democratically elected) government needs violently opposing' 3 & 4) That is precisely what is happening, the sensible half of your country (for now in the ascendant) wants to (and will) implement greater gun control, and you and the poster of this discussion are threatening violent revolution.  I believe people who advocate armed revolution by the minority to be undemocratic, tyrannical, traitorous and dare I say it 'unamerican'.	0

Oh there is persecution in America but its slowly coming and I can see it.

Your list sounds strangely like it is persecution to tell people they are wrong. Why has Christianity been persecuting people so long? Why is Christianity based on persecution (witnessing)? You are not actually being persecuted in America, sorry, seeing as the video is an example of true persecution. China yes, America no.	0

Super speed: Wolves better Super strength: Wolves better Rapid regeneration: Wolves better Vampire bites werewolf: Nothing happens Werewolf bites vampire: Vampire get infected and die. Epic fail vamps.	"""Vampires, are known for their superhuman agility, speed, balance, and tracking people or things according to their scent They also have the ability to hypnotize their victims with their mesmerizing eyes, which will at times flash in a golden or silver tone, depending on their mood. They can fly for a limited period, as long as it is night in their human form. If they are in their bat form, they can fly relatively longer in exchange for their increased vulnerability to sunlight. Speaking of transforming into bats, they can transform into any creature they wise, but it has to be real. (No imaginary stuff, well, maybe a dragon.) Since they are the living-dead, they can survive without having to eat food or water, although they can eat to blend into society. They can stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, because they don't need to breathe. More powerful vampires can control the weather, so vampire hunters usually target areas where there has been much unusual cloudy or foggy days/nights. They can be inflicted with a small/large amount of damage, but they need human blood to replenish themselves if the damage is large. If it is like a small cut, it can be healed fast by itself. Vampires can live on animal blood instead of human. They also don't age until after a few centuries. This can be prevented by drinking a baby's blood, which is known for their regenerative properties. More advanced vampires mastered the use of their minds, such as telepathy, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, Some of them can enter and manipulate dreams of humans, or use their shadows to fufill their deeds."" - Yahoo User This makes a werewolf look like shit.

Major food...Turkey. Native to America. Peanut Butter. Ice Cream. Time Zones were created by us. We also probably have the most headstrong government in existence. We touched the moon first. We made Facebook. We made the Xbox 360. We made modern baseball. We used the first and only nuke on another country. I believe we invented the internet. We invented roller skates. We performed the first oil drilling. We made the telephone. We made the microwave oven. We made the segway which is that two wheeled thing people drive and stand on. We made the bionic eye lens. We made the machine gun. We made a smoke detector and we made the ferries wheel. We made the assembly line. We made the tractor. I can go on and on about all the things we made. America has culture. It may be the child to Great Britain but we formed our own nation and we have made a culture for ourselves.	I'm not saying simply things America has invented, I know a lot of inventions came out of this country. I mean of the culture, things that define America. American's don't identify themselves by a time zone. If turkey is American native, then I assume you mean it wasn't stolen from the Native Americans, and if you don't then that is one I can agree with. We touched the moon first. Although that is true, that's also not a culture thing, that was a race between U.S. and Russia, and it wasn't even America's idea to do it 1st.  We made modern baseball I can agree to that.

I think as a whole the decisions made by the masses are better than those made as an individual. When you have a diverse group of people you get opinions that tend to differ from your own. While you may think you're always right, the fact is that there are many smart people out there whose opinions could help you make a better decision. That's the beauty of this site. I get to hear everyone else's opinions on some very important and controversial topics and then formulate my own perspective.	He is right, the problem with most issues today is that not enough questions are being asked. With a diverse population, greed and corruption does not go unpunished.	0

I've already said this before. I am not a Creationist, but a Catholic whose Church already accepts most forms of evolutionary science. I personally am aghast at the complete lack of evidence for the two engines of Darwinism- namely random mutation and natural selection. Random mutation = still-born mutant offspring, natural selection = rare instances of overpopulation	They don't randomly mutate, they evolve for the better, they evolve to become a more dominant and powerful species, they evolve to survive.  That is why I, as an angry bird, have evolved so that when I am launched you can press the screen and I turn into three separate birds. I am very effective when I am used to smash glass, too. This is one example of evolution.  Another example would be that my friends have evolved to be suicide bombers easier than buying the equipment, you just fire them, press the screen, and they explode! We'll teach those who steal our eggs!	0
The internet is the fastest way to get access to the most up to date news, market trends, weather, etc. If you have to make an important decision, having access to this type of information is essential. We all know that the majority of people do not sit in front of their computers all day. While on the move, the iPhone provides it's users with the fastest and most advanced browser of any smart phone on the market (that I know of). Therefore it is essential for people who make important decisions to have access to an iPhone at all times.	Nearly every single phone on the market today can access the internet, and a lot of them do it a hell of a lot quicker (3G). And if you seriously need the internet at all times, then I feel pretty sorry for you.	0
Firstly abortion has to do with an unborn life, innocent of all crimes, mistakes or guilt. The fetus as we all know is referred to as a growing human being which can also be referred to as a human organism. The term organism refers to life so the terms combined would mean human life. The Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.  Most abortions occur before the embryo becomes a foetus, about 50%. Around 35% occur before it's a well-developed foetus. This means you're killing unconscious, unintelligent tissues. It isn't a human life at this point. A well-developed foetus isn't a human life either, because its body depends on another host being, its body is not complete in other words. What puzzles me is many who oppose the death penalty supports abortion when they claim that they are so concerned about human life. If they are so concerned about human life then why would they support the taking of the life of the unborn? This in my opinion is hypocrisy. Practice what you speak not the opposite.  This is simple actually. Killing a prisoner is removing a living, breathing, thinking human from existence. Killing a foetus is removing something that only resembles a human, but is not for lack of ability to think, from existence. Why fight for the life of a criminal who has and may continue to kill and never regret it when at the same time you are supporting for innocent young lives to be killed in horrific methods of abortion when you claim the death penalty is horrific itself. Because they are not innocent young lives. They are in the process of becoming lives.	"Whether or not abortions occur before the embryo becomes a fetus you fail to understand that these tissues are the tissues of a growing human being. Contrary to what many non-scientists believe, human beings are not constructed in the womb - they develop. In fact, all the major organ systems are initiated within the first few weeks after conception. The process of embryonic development is a continuous process, with no obvious point at which the fetus magically becomes a ""person."" In fact, the development process continues well after birth, including many characteristics that determine our personality or personhood. What are the stages in human embryonic development? Science tells us that the heart of the human fetus begins to form 18 days after conception. There is a measurable heart beat 21-24 days after conception. This is only 7-10 days after a women would expect to begin her menses. Since most women have cycles that can vary by this amount, they do not discover they are pregnant until after this point. Therefore, all abortions stop a beating heart, even ""early"" abortions. However, most abortions do not occur until 4-6 weeks after the fetus begins to form. The human brain begins to form on day 23 is formed enough to produce brain waves by 6 weeks, which means that most abortions destroy a functioning human brain. The U.S Supreme Court has ruled in favor of this argument by ruling that life begins at conception. What part of my argument do you not get? If it isn't a human life then how come it is developing into a human being? I am getting fed up of hearing merely opinions from you. Show me authoritative proof to back up your claim. Doctors have attested that it is a human organism which is a growing human being and also the term organism means life. It takes time for every living being to grow even after being born so what are you trying to imply? Don't infants depend on the body of their mother for breastmilk after they are borned too? WHAT TEXTBOOKS SAY ON THE EMBRYO The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology ""Zygote: this cell results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo). Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual."" ATTESTATION OF WHAT THIS CLUMP OF TISSUES LOOK LIKE ACCORDING TO THIS PERSON ""I opened the sock up and I put it on the towel and there were parts in there of a person. I'd taken anatomy; I was a medical student. I knew what I was looking at. There was a little scapula [shoulder blade] and there was an arm, and I saw some ribs and a chest, and I saw a little tiny head, and I saw a piece of a leg, and I saw a tiny hand. ... I checked it out and there were two arms and two legs and one head, etc., and I turned and said, I guess you got it all ... It was pretty awful that first time... it was like somebody put a hot poker into me."" Again so if you are removing a fetus because only of lack of ability to think then should you remove a person who is fully paralzyed or on stroke because he or she lacks the abililty to think? It resembles a human being because it is from the human race and it is a human life. If i recalled you called that thing in one of our earlier argument human organism which means human life. So what are you disputing now? Well if you say they are not innocent then prove to me why they are not innocent? Did they commit any crimes or any unforgivable actions because according to you they lack the ability to think. Right? Then prove to me that they are in the process of becoming lives when their process of life has already begin from the moment of conception as is evident in the ruling of the Supreme Court along with the proof of scientific research from doctors."	0

The states were allowed to whatever they wanted so long as it didn't contradict with the bill of rights. The rights of the people come before administrative protocol. So you believe starting the bloodiest war in American history over something that could have been solved legally? Seriously, at this time, some states were already abolishing slavery and any state admitted to the union would vote as to if it would be free or slave. If we had waited a bit longer and tryed to actually solve the issue logically, maybe hundreds of thousands of people wouldn't have died in a war that ended in extremely harsh feelings between the South, North and former slaves. This way of thinking is what caused the worst war in American history, slavery didn't cause it, America's idiotic idea of dealing with it did.	0
"I'm new to this site, but I put up points that I agree with, and ones that I don't agree with I put down.

"'As for ""proof"" I’m not sure that is possible with such a subjective metaphysical perspective. Probably, the better question to ask is whether it works for you--or better yet, if it works for those who are into it. In this, it may be helpful to adopt a more sympathetic frame of mind, since adopting a hostile skepticism (i.e., that it is rubbish until proven otherwise) is apt to negate the cooperation of people you will need to observe in order to tell if it ""works"" for them. As with many things, it may ""work"" but not for the reasons they think it does. The asian sensibility which came up with ch’i, does not see things in terms of neatly linear chains of cause and effect, but rather as a tangled web of sanguine human connections (affinities and antipathies) which generate their own complex webs of causation, and their own unique perceptions.' Quoted from a friend. Unlike the bible, you dont have to believe it to feel the effects and you dont need to debunk it either. It is between you and your natural surroundings. And no, Chi can be manipulated at will it would not need adrenaline surge reserves. Watch a documentary by Stan Lee about a monk who punched a dummy witch calculates impact. His punch is equivalent to that of a professional boxer who spends most of his life perfecting that one move, while the monk obviously spent his time doing much much more. Btw, this may very well be natural but just because it seems alien to you so thats why it is supernatural."	And no, Chi can be manipulated at will it would not need adrenaline surge reserves.  I only said it may be possible for them to tap into their adrenaline to give them a boost, not that they were actually doing it. All I am saying is that what they are doing is within the realm of science, they haven't done anything undeniably supernatural. Science may be a bit baffled or confused on the matter at the moment, but there is no reason to believe their abilities are outside of the realm of science.  Btw, this may very well be natural but just because it seems alien to you so thats why it is supernatural. It doesn't seem alien to me. I'm fascinated by it. Everything that we have studied we are either still studying it, or we have found a naturalistic explanation for it. Nothing so far has conclusively had a supernatural explanation.	0
All of your, and other atheists', qualms with Christianity regards the Old Testament; if they bothered to realize that there is a difference between the Judaism of the Old Testament and Christianity of the New Testament, they'd stop getting all those pesky up-votes for either their ignorance or their speciousness.

Well Sports in school is a great idea to have not only because of obesity in the schools but because this is something that kids enjoy doing not to mention it can be the start of a great career for some.	It is rare for a obsessed student to engage of his own free will in a sport which will allow him to lose weight.  It is also a very low chance that any student will make a career out of his sport. Kids may enjoy it but there are other entities which can provide the necessary facilities without it being such a drain on taxes.	0
I'm just talking about food, neither crack nor flintstone vitamins are food. Realistically we're not going to go out of our way to find something intentionally dangerous for kids. Something perhaps more along the lines of sweets vs bananas in a middle or high school level. I've heard of schools that remove the soda machines, and then students just horde soda when they get home.	I slightly disagree. I think obesity is actually a bigger problem than crack when you consider it in terms of how many die of heart disease compared to crack, how many don't know how to eat compared to how many people are addicted to crack. Peope know crack is bad, they don't know in large part which foods are. My stance is from what I've seen and what I hear from people trying to lose weight, very fat people think it's natural and there is nothing they can do about it because they think the way they eat is normal in large part. This begins at a young age. Everyone thinks they know how to eat, but it's never taught, they just keep eating as they did as a kid and wonder why they get fat. So why not teach them how to eat at a young age?  Whether a kid hordes soda at home is an issue with the parents, and they need to get their fat kid under control. That kid doesn't represent the whole though.	0
One can believe that their theory is correct while being open to refutation. An agnostic can believe in the existence of God, but recognize that the burden of proof remains.

The problem with this new argument you are bringing up, the ""Let's not talk about this"" one, is that it's still an issue. If it wasn't an issue gays would be allowed to marry or they wouldn't care, but since they do care, and are not allowed to get married, then it is still very much an issue."	0
Yes I seriously do it is a lot easier than living a life that you don't enjoy because most have the motive once it's done your life is over and you won't have to go through it anymore you'll find a lot of suicidal people find it easy to bring themselves to the point that they'll kill themselves because its what they want to do instead of facing their life and that is why I see it is cowardly.	"As I said in my reply immediately above, easier is not the same thing as easy; the former implies a relative position to an unendurable level of pain and suffering whereas the latter implies no relative position but rather that the action is a simple one and not a difficult decision to make. As someone who has experienced suicidal ideation I can assure you that even the consideration of taking one's life is not ""easy"". Suicide is not an easy choice nor an ""easy way out"". For those who take their lives it is seen as the only course of action left to them and is generally done after considerable turmoil and an extended period of suicidal ideation. It is not a matter of courage or bravery but of endurance, and I would contend not only that every person has their limits but that those who call suicide cowardly would be hard pressed to endure the pain and suffering the precedes suicide should they have the misfortune to encounter it themselves. Sure, taking one's life is in a sense an act of escape but such an act is not innately cowardly when it is taken in its appropriate context. For instance: I fail to see how it is cowardly to be pushed beyond the natural limits of the human endurance of pain and suffering through no choice of one's own. I similarly fail to see how it is cowardly to be subject to changes in brain chemistry and structure which you do not choose to experience."	0

White guilt is over, we're all one human species, so stop dividing us and demanding pity on certain groups of people because of stuff they can't help."	"Yeah the president is black, so what! In fact, to put that in the pro sides advantage, our president has been accused for many crimes by Republicans, conservatives, Tea Party activist, etc. So, overall, just because your the president it doesn't mean anything. Its a victory for black people in America, but that is just one person, not the majority of African Americans. White guilt is NEVER over. Although, many white people have finally made sense that the division of the American nation has brought nothing but conflict, there are still supremacists who disagree and have a flame of hatred towards colored people that it will never go out. There are still racist confederates, KKK, the racist kind of skinheads, and the Neo-Nazi who are all still existent today that hate African Americans or of that descendant. The fact you said that it is ""stuff that can't be helped"" is truly what bothered me the most from your argument. It can be helped and my evidence is the history of America in the 1960's where civil rights movements ""helped"" elevate black people and color people in general. In the end, black people (but really it should say colored people in general) have been treated unfairly. I wouldn't say like bullshit, as we already achieved our rights during the 1960's. Yet, we still face prejudice from white people, but know that I am talking about a certain group of white people, not as a whole. I am not as rash to say all southerner whites are racist as its not true at all."	0
I think it depends on the situation. If there is a shooting and someone pushes for gun control because of it than I'd say they were just using it as an example. Nothing wrong with that. However if you use the same shooting to criticize an opposite party than that isn't right. Not to insult the GOP but when Romney used the Libya attack to criticize Obama that was wrong. But when Obama used the Auora shooting as a reason for gun control that was okay in my book. This is only because in the first example, the push was for politics. In the second example the push was for a resolution for a problem. Again no disrespect for the GOP	Nothing wrong with that. However if you use the same shooting to criticize an opposite party than that isn't right. Not to insult the GOP but when Romney used the Libya attack to criticize Obama that was wrong. I agree completely. It's a selfish thing when done that way. But when Obama used the Auora shooting as a reason for gun control that was okay in my book I do believe there is a degree of discussion to be had, and frankly I don't remember how soon it was that Obama brought up gun control after the shooting so I can't speak about how I feel it came across. But I do believe there is a line to be crossed between reacting to a situation and taking advantage of one.	0

I never said religion was rational, religion is propaganda. (IMO) So wouldnt it be rational to wonder HOW all this stuff came to be? And if you dont believe in god you could just believe in the multiverse theory, or string theory, but god does not have to be a person, god could just be the force that keeps our blood pumping, wither way, there was some creative force to everything that has come into the universe.	I never said religion was rational, religion is propaganda. I know, I realise I kind of went off on a tangent there. Unfortunately, these sorts of debates so often have a 'us v them' side to it, so that's what I'm used to. So wouldnt it be rational to wonder HOW all this stuff came to be? Yes. And that's what science does, it seeks to answer it all by assuming nothing, under strict scientific procedure. And if you dont believe in god you could just believe in the multiverse theory, or string theory You are assuming that everyone needs to give an answer as to how the universe started. Quite frankly, I don't know. I don't feel that science can currently provide a good enough answer for me to agree with it completely, and I don't think that religion is a good alternative. Now to me, that's the main difference between 'New Atheists' and theists, when theists don't know they say God did it, where atheists don't know they say they don't know. Also, you're assuming that atheists believe in science, which many don't. Atheism is the lack of belief in a God, that is all. But yes, I understand why you make the connection. but god does not have to be a person, god could just be the force that keeps our blood pumping, wither way, there was some creative force to everything that has come into the universe. See, now that's an entirely different argument. I do agree that there is an uncanny beauty in the universe, an amazing connection between it all, and that we are exceptionally lucky that it all fits together. But I do not see that as God, I see that as beauty, as luck, as simply how the world is. To me, a God is an omnipresent, all powerful being that exists independently of matter and time. I do not think that exists, therefore I am an Atheist.	0

My problem with Dems: overtaxation, overreach of Constitutionally granted authority, over regulation, freedom of belief violations such as punishing people of faith, progressive taxation is a joke, globalism, indefinate detention without legal recource or just cause, wiretapping without warrants or just cause, police brutality, violations of the right of mentally stable people to bear arms, targeting libertarians, conservatives, and Christians, failure to use Constitutionally required procedure to declare and go to war, giving the president too much power, fraud, criminal activity, the Patriot Act, NDAA, and other similar acts, censorship, and so on. My problem with repubs; overreach of constitutionally granted authority, policing the world, dictating nonharmful private sex and marriage life, antichoice legislation, antiarab bigotry, antimuslim bigotry, indefinate detention without legal recourse of just cause, wire tapping without just cause, police brutality, targeting libertarians and Muslims, failure to use Constitutionally require procedure in declaring and going to war, giving the president too much power, fraud, criminal activity, the Oatriot Act, NDAA, and other similar acts, censorship, and so on.

Theists don't just believe in God. They know God exists. Maybe not literally, but try telling them that God isn't real. Their religious texts are enough supporting evidence for them. Same goes for Athiests. Their Bible is science, so to speak. Agnostics believe that either side may be correct but knows that either God himself is going to have to pay us a visit or we're going to have to die before we get an answer.	Maybe not literally the point I was trying to make was that nobody literally knows, nobody is truly gnostic.	0
So you're saying that if it is for the good of society that there be no black people, they should make a law ordering their extermination, and that they (blacks) should be compliant with it?

There are plenty of reasons, oil is one, although not that important in this conflict it can still not be neglected i.e. ensuring its price and security of supply i.e. stability is another. They also want to maintain a good foothold in the region, the US and nato want to show that they're in control of the situation. Also, i think there may be an element of divertin attention from the fact that they (US mainly but France and UK to) are backing the very dictators that are massacring and repressing their people i.e. Bahrain, Yemen, Saudi Arabia. Not syria obviously, thats why is receving so much air time on Western media.	That's all bullshit and you know it. Barry didn't even want to get into the Libya mess but he's a wuss and the French were embarrassing him. As for Bahrain and Yemen... I don't disagree... we are backing their leaders, as for Saudi Arabia, they are not massacring their people (at least not yet)... And by your own admission, we don't back the Syrian government so just what in the hell you trying to prove exactly? Your sole purpose on this site is to blame America for everything... Blame away, I don't care. Obama sucks! That's my whole point. His policies are inconsistent and make little sense to me... When the Iranian citizens were rising up he did nothing!

There are a number of people who identify and present outside of the binary, and there are a lot of people who are racially ambiguous.  Oh, absolutely. However a similar point can be made of theists as well. Their particular interpretations of Biblical teachings, their status on the fundie-to-moderate scale, their actual actions (or lack thereof) against non-Christians can not be determined by simply being able to identify them. And no matter where they are in any of these, they are almost certainly not attempting to persecute you by being cheerful. I think it is all a matter of letting the response fit the action. Deal with situations one on one. I think in this instance, you are reading way more into their intent than necessary.  In this case, a non-theist who is very sensitive to theism is likely someone who has been hurt very badly by religion.  If a Caucasian had been mugged by a non-Caucasian, is it rational to assume that all of the later category will do that? Is it really beneficial to let one's emotions and personal experiences dictate a response?   and no matter how well intentioned can still be insensitive. And being offended by a well-intentioned act that has no inherent evil intent or effects is a waste of time and energy.  A concession made to recognize that not everyone is Christian. Precisely. Not a concession to recognize that not everyone is theistic.  Non-theistic folks are a part of the non-Christian demographic, and everyone realizes this.	 I think in this instance, you are reading way more into their intent than necessary.  You have misunderstood me. My argument is not that the greetings are malicious, but that an action ought to be evaluated by consequence at least as much as by intent. This is a frequent standard in legal practice, as well as in social interactions. Arguing that consequences are objectionable does not negate that the intent was not.  If a Caucasian had been mugged by a non-Caucasian, is it rational to assume that all of the later category will do that? Is it really beneficial to let one's emotions and personal experiences dictate a response?  Again, you misunderstand me. I was not casting validity on the act of judging all members of an entire group based upon the actions of some of its members. My argument was that when a person belongs to a group with a history of oppression and discrimination, they have some degree of accountability for understanding that history and how they are an embodiment of that history regardless of their personal conduct. I was not a member of Christopher Columbus' party, but wishing a Native American a happy Columbus Day is still insensitive (particularly when coming from a white man).  And being offended by a well-intentioned act that has no inherent evil intent or effects is a waste of time and energy.  I object to the assumption that this my argument is based purely on emotional offense. Certainly, emotion is a factor and I'll get to that in a moment. However my response to those wishing me a happy holiday or a merry Christmas has never been anger or rejection. I usually wish them a happy holiday back. I am fully capable of accepting the good intention and regulating my own emotions, but that does not mean I cannot simultaneously advance an argument for heightened sensitivity and tolerance. With respect to emotions specifically, however, I ask the following question: If it is such a simple matter to ask people to just not be offended when they have a reason to be, why is it such a difficult thing to ask people to check their privilege when they have no reason not to do so? Non-theistic folks are a part of the non-Christian demographic, and everyone realizes this. Frankly, not in my experience. Were your claim demonstrably true, I would have little to no objection to Happy Holidays at all (as I believe I indicated, if not quite so explicitly).	0

Having only naturally born Americans is a good thing. Being a natural born American allows that person to grow up in America with a true American identity (though I'm not saying immigrants don't have it). They've been in American all of their lives and they learn what and how America fits in the world, from an American perspective. If we allowed foreigners to become President, one could have a major grudge against us and then become President to tear us apart from the inside. Not a good thing.	Oh bullocks. I am not talking about foreigners running for President. I am talking about CITIZENS running for President. All that matters is whether you have been an Amen for at least ten years, and will be in the future. Being an American is NOT about where you are born, but where your heart is.	0
"The definition of ""Omnibenevolence"" is as follows: All-loving, or infinitely good, regarding an individual's persona or character, usually in reference to a deity or supernatural being, for example, 'God'. It's use is often with regards to the divine triad, whereby a deity is described to be simultaneously omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent. This triad is used especially with the Christian god, Yahweh. The definition of ""Omniscient"" is ""all knowing and ever wise."" Likewise, the definition of ""Omnipotent"" is ""almighty, all powerful with unstaggering force."" These definitions are provided per ""The Oxford Dictionary of English"", 1989. I believe it is you, sir, who has failed to consider these three properties in conjunction. The bible stated what God is; omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient. Since the information on God strictly comes from the bible, it is the only logical reference that is relevant to combining these properties. Simply because God is all knowing, all powerful and infinitely good does not compel him to restrict human liberty, which would be the act of a janus God. Even if humans ""choose"" to behave in absurdly malicious and insidious manners, God will not confront them and prohibit their will. The presence of so called ""evil"" is not a viable argument against the Judeo-Christian God.  If God were to stand idly by and watch a man rape a little girl, it is clear how most atheists would consider this ""impotence"" as ""evil"" and contradictory to his professed ""omnipotence."" However, God is unwilling to dictate his ""creation's"" actions and thus waits to judge those individuals. If human life on this side was perfect, why would there need to be a ""heaven""? The scriptures state that this life is necessary to judge and test our reactions and contributions in a form of ""weeding out"" those who are most unsavoury and insidious.  Are courts of law considered heinous for sentencing hardened criminals guilty of murder in the first degree? Not likely. Those individuals are guilty of their crimes and must pay for them."	"The source which states that god has those three properties is irrelevant to the analyzes of them.  Given the power to stop evil, is it good to allow evil to occur? For example, it is good for me to watch over a man raping a women when I hold a gun, or should I wait till he is finished to shot him?  It holds no benefit to punish someone after their death, in life it hold a benefit to imprison people because it isolates them from committing similar acts, and grants time for them to change. Punishment after death only holds loses, and no benefit. There is nothing good in it.  Why bother creating those in need of weeding out? Especially if you are ominiscient, and omnipowerful. you would have full knowledge of the evil they will impose on others, it is no different than pulling a trigger of a gun to someone's head and saying, ""hey the bullet had a chance of being a dud""."	0
killing innocent creations for one's selfish needs...isn't the characteristic of an evolved specie. Biologically, it is. Survival of the fittest. This is exactly how evolution works. Name one other species on the planet that actively works to protect members of another species out of love, not personal benefits. NAME ONE. It ain't pretty, but that is how it works.	"yes what your saying is true among animals. I would argue this debate is wether we've evolved PAST the ""animal stage"" I would say we have despite what you say makes sense.

Happy Holidays is the correct term as there are many pagan festivals and celebrations that fall at this time of year, Jesus was actually born in the Spring/Summer time which is supported by the Bible and Christianity is a late joiner in this whole religious festival game	"Don't people say ""Happy Holidays"" during this time of the year because Christians are celebrating Christmas, Jews are celebrating Hanukkah, certain African-Americans celebrate Kwanzaa... and so on? Basically, they say that because different cultures are celebrating their respective Holy-Days around the same time... and isn't Christmas supposed to be the celebration of the birth of Jesus, rather than it actually being his birthday?"	0
"This website sums it all up: <a href='http://thedevineevidence.com/jesus_similarities.html'>http://thedevineevidence.com/jesus_similarities.html   ""According to Egyptian mythology, Horus was originally believed to be the son of Ra and Hathor and the husband/brother of Isis. Later he  was seen as the son of Osiris and Isis once Hathor and Isis were merged into one being. Horus was considered the sky, sun, and moon god  represented by a man with the head of falcon. VIRGIN BIRTH There are two separate birth accounts in regards to Horus (neither depict a virgin birth): Version 1: Hathor, the motherly personification of the milky way, is said to have conceived Horus but we are told her husband, Ra, was an  Egyptian sun god. Hathor (a sky goddess) was represented by the cow whose milk brought forth the milky way. By the will of her husband Ra,  she gave birth to Horus: ""I, Hathor of Thebes, mistress of the goddesses, to grant to him a coming forth into the presence [of the god]... Hathor of Thebes, who was  incarnate in the form of a cow and a woman."" Source and Source Version 2: When we examine Isis as Horus' mother, we are told Isis was not a virgin, but the widow of Osiris. Isis practices magic to raise  Osiris from the dead so she can bear a son that would avenge his death. Isis then becomes pregnant from the sperm of her deceased  husband. Again, no virgin birth occurs: ""[Isis] made to rise up the helpless members [penis] of him whose heart was at rest, she drew from him his essence [sperm], and she made  therefrom an heir [Horus]."" Source and Source THE FATHER AND SON UNITY Critics suggest the Christian trinity was adapted from the notion of Osiris, Ra, and Horus being one god in  essence. Because Horus was born after the death of Osiris, it came to be believed he was the resurrection, or reincarnation, of Osiris: ""He avengeth thee in his name of 'Horus, the son who avenged his father."" Source Throughout the centuries, the Egyptians eventually considered Osiris and Horus as one and the same. However, this son-as-the-father  comparison more closely resembles the metamorphosis of Hathor into Isis than it does the Christian trinity. We see Horus first as the son of  Ra, then being the equivalent of Ra, then Ra finally becoming just as aspect of Horus. Similar to Hathor and Isis, we simply see a merger of  one being into another. In Egyptian mythology, each god had a distinct beginning by being conceived from other gods. In Christian  theology, God and Jesus always existed as one and the same, neither having a beginning or an end. Jesus' birth did not represent His  creation- only His advent in human from. Furthermore, the father-son concept was not created by first-century Christians. Prophecies in the  Old Testament referred to the future Messiah as the Son of God up to 1,000 years before the birth of Christ. I Chronicles 17:13-14 CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION Horus is never said to have been crucified, nevertheless to have died. The only connection we can  make to Horus being resurrected is if we consider the eventual merger of Horus and Osiris. But such a theory results in an catch 22,  apparently noticed by the Egyptians as they later altered their beliefs to fix the contradictions. In the Egyptian tale, Osiris is either  dismembered by Set in battle or sealed in a chest and drowned in the Nile. Isis then pieces Osiris' body back together and resurrects Osiris to  conceive an heir that will avenge Osiris' death (although technically Osiris is never actually resurrected as he is forbidden to return to the world  of the living). Source and Source ""[Set] brought a shapely and decorated chest, which he had caused to be made according to the measurements of the king's body... Set  proclaimed that he would gift the chest unto him whose body fitted its proportions with exactness... Then Osiris came forward. He lay down  within the chest, and he filled it in every part. But dearly was his triumph won in that dark hour which was his doom. Ere he could raise his  body, the evil followers of Set sprang suddenly forward and shut down the lid, which they nailed fast and soldered with lead. So the richly  decorated chest became the coffin of the good king Osiris, from whom departed the breath of life."" Source BORN ON THE 25TH OF DECEMBER Horus' birth was actually celebrated during the month of Khoiak, (October/November). Though some  critics claim Horus was born during the winter solstice, this shows more of a relationship to other pagan religions which considered the solstices  sacred. TWELVE DISCIPLES Superficially this similarity seems accurate until we see Horus' ""disciples"" were not disciples at all- they were the twelve  signs of the zodiac which became associated with Horus, a sky god. However Jesus' disciples were actual men who lived and died, whose  writings exist to this day, and whose lives are recorded by historians. Because Horus' ""disciples"" were merely signs of the zodiac, they never  taught his philosophy or spread his teachings. The fact that there are twelve signs of the zodiac (twelve months) as compared to Jesus' twelve  apostles is an insignificant coincidence. MOUNTAINTOP ENCOUNTER Critics point out the similarity of both Jesus and Horus having an encounter on a mountaintop with their  enemies. Instead of dissecting this piece by piece, I will simply give each version of events and let the reader observe the (obvious)  differences: Jesus: After Jesus completes His fast in the wilderness, Satan tries to tempt Jesus by offering Him all the kingdoms of the world if Jesus  agrees to worship him, but Jesus refuses. Matthew 4:1-11 Horus: During battle, Horus rips off one of Set's testicles while Set (sometimes called Seth) gorges out Horus' eye. Set later tries to prove his  dominance by initiating intercourse with Horus. Horus catches Set's semen in his hand and throws it into a nearby river. Horus later  masturbates and spreads his semen over lettuce which Set consumes. Both Set and Horus stand before the gods to proclaim their right to rule  Egypt. When Set claims dominance over Horus, his semen is found in the river. When Horus' dominance is considered, his semen is found  within Set so Horus is granted rule over Egypt: ""O that castrated one! O this man! O he who hurries him who hurries, among you two! These- this first corporation of the company of the  justified... Was born before the eye of Horus was plucked out, before the testicles of Set were torn away."" Source ""It is the day on which Horus  fought with Set, who cast filth in the face of Horus, and when Horus destroyed the powers of Set."" Source ""Then [Set] appeared before the  divine council and claimed the throne. But the gods gave judgment that Horus was the rightful king, and he established his power in the land of  Egypt, and became a wise and strong ruler like to his father Osiris."" Source Skeptic Interjection: Does the similarity between the names Set and Satan hold any significance? Answer: Set's variant names include Seth, Sutekh, Setesh, and Seteh. The root Set is usually considered to translate into dazzler or stable  pillar. The different suffixes of his name add the meanings majestic, supreme, and desert. The name Satan comes from the Semitic root Stn  which represents opposition. Before his fall, Satan's original name was Lucifer, or angel of light. The term Satan represents a general  adversary, hence his accepted identity. Though both names consist of an S and a T, their meanings have nothing in common. The spellings are  only a result of the original root words which represent their character. Source and Source SIMILAR TITLES Critics allege Horus held similar titles used to identify Jesus such as Messiah, Savior, Son of Man, Good Shepherd, Lamb of  God, The Way, the Truth, the Light, and Living Word. However I can find no evidence of any of these names ever being used in reference to  Horus. I am especially suspicious of the word Messiah since it is Hebrew in origin. IN CONCLUSION We can see the differences between Jesus and Horus far outweigh any superficial correlations."" So, no......."	Simply too much similarity to be an accident myth about Jesus was obviously inspired in Horus.	0
A strict society is a poorly governed one. It turns people into drones, and if there's no freedom, no ability to make your own decisions, what's the point in life? Your right to freedom ends where mine begins, and vice versa. Don't rape, murder, or steal, but beyond that, what I do is my business and what you do is yours. Religion - the basis of it - isn't the problem, it's the people in it. As a response to the original question, I wouldn't object to the religion, I would object to the people, because people will corrupt it	Being strict for the goal of peace is much better than an unrestrained freedom where acts of injustice are ignored and even promoted.	0

Well, as long as the other person isn't over 18, it's legal in every state I believe. So I'm not sure what the problem is. There's nothing illegal about two people both under the age of consent having sex with eachother I dont' think. If they are over the age of consent, and you are under the age of consent, in your State, then you are probably making a mistake of one sort or another anyway. Unless you're a dude underage, then it's more like a score, but the other person could still be arrested. Unless you are both in High School, and one of you happens to be over 18 and you live in a State where age of consent is 18.  One of you could go to jail anyway and be labeled a sex offender for life, which is actually kind of retarded if you are both in High School.	The age of consent is just that, the minimum age in which a person can consent to sex.

First off, this question is not good. The two senses that are being posed against each other are rather entwined.

Well firstly you are mistaking the executing of the person and the appeals process that follows because it is not the death penalty itself that is expensive but the appeal processes that follows. Overcrowding leads to more prisons, more medical bills, more crimes in society which cause government to spend more money to fight and control crime. For now the death penalty might be expensive but studies have shown that the costs for prison functions will increase since it is already increasing yearly and added to that will be the additional costs for fighting crimes. This is what i found when i was doing my research.  Well you are right because nothing can change my opinion on something once i decide. And you are right we law students do not change but challenge.	"""mistaking the executing of the person and the appeals process that follows because it is not the death penalty itself that is expensive but the appeal processes that follows."" I consider appeals part of the capital punishment process. Either way, you're just arguing semantics. ""For now the death penalty might be expensive but studies have shown that the costs for prison functions will increase since it is already increasing yearly and added to that will be the additional costs for fighting crimes."" Okay, capital punishment might make sense one day. That doesn't particularly matter to me. The point of this debate was whether or not one can logically oppose it while supporting abortion, and I believe you can. I also think you can use logic to flip that around, or perhaps oppose or support both at once. There are decent arguments for both sides (well, abortion anyway. As it stands, CP is dead in the water) and it's a pretty tough issue to debate without a lot of free time. The sort of time investment that you would only bother with if you actually cared what the person on the other end thinks. It's not black and white is what I'm saying. Not many things are."	0
Circular reasoning is circular! One can agree with someone generally but not agree with them entirely, and I often find myself curious as to the reasoning behind a point that I agree with and question that. Details matter. The thought process matters. Debate isn't just about one side or the other winning, it's also about learning for all of those involved. As to my text being unreadable- it's wordy, but far from unreadable, and I've had numerous discussions with those who didn't seem to have any difficulty following what I'm writing. I'm not certain if it's your reading comprehension that is lacking, or if you just can't be bothered to read that much, but it's immaterial; neither case constitutes a problem on my part, and both cases are marks against you within the context of a debate forum.

No offense but for you to give up your faith just like that to me seems like you always had doubt in your heart throughout the whole 25 years your faith was never strong it doesn't matter if you were going to church every Sunday or Saturday and being active in the church you were always doubtful as Jesus said Ye of little faith why did you doubt but I am younger than you and can't really tell you anything about your life. Another thing what about Noah's ark that was found.	"I didn't give it up ""just like that"". It was a very slow process that took many years.  that to me seems like you always had doubt in your heart I didn't have any doubt. In fact I was so sure of my belief that I was one of those obnoxious Christians that tried to convert everyone. I spent many years doing in-depth studies of the Bible and researching the history of Christianity. I spent ridiculous amounts of time at the library of my local Christian school studying and praying. I went to Bible studies every day at my college. I wrote many letters to friends and family sharing my faith with them. I even wrote tracts that I passed out on the street. They were about gods love, not the hellfire and damnation ones that are so common. During one of my courses in college we had to do a speech on our hero. I chose god and proselytized to the whole class on how great god was and much he loved them. My instructor wasn't too happy about it, and pulled me aside after class. So to sum things up, I was gung-ho for god and thought he was the greatest thing ever. The funny thing is, the thing that made me come to realize that Christianity isn't true was studying the Bible. It wasn't anything said by atheists. I didn't even know any atheists at the time, and didn't read anti-christian stuff, because I thought they were all evil heathens. It was simply reading the Bible and seeing all the horrific things done by god and his followers that made me realize that god is either a total psychopath, or he was made up by men who used it as an excuse to commit atrocities and manipulate people. After weighing those two options, I came to the conclusion that it was the latter. It was my sense of ethics and morality that led me to not accept the god described in the Bible, and not the other way around as most Christians seem to think. There's a saying the the atheist community, ""If you want to turn a Christian into an atheist, tell them to study their Bible."" what about Noah's ark that was found People have claimed Noah's ark has been found many times, and every time it has been proven false. Here's an interesting article on it <a href='http://www.livescience.com/7137-noah-ark-discovered.html'>http://www.livescience.com/7137-noah-ark-discovered.html  . The story of Noah's ark is an impossibility for so many reasons, but I think we may be getting too far off topic by going into that. However, that would make an interesting debate, so I'll go ahead a post a new debate about it."	0

In 2005, the US had 2,279 murders committed by teenagers (27.9 per million residents) compared to 73 in Japan (3.1 per million). Per capita video game sales were $5.20 in the US compared to $47 in Japan. (2) (3) (4) 5. Claims like these have been blamed since radio, movies, and television have been introduced. It did not increase violence. Sources (1)""Crime in the United States, 2008,"" FBI website, Sep. 2009 (2) ""2008 CESA Game White Paper,"" Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), 2008 (3)""Crime in the United States, 2005,"" FBI website, Sep. 2006 (4)""White Paper on Crime 2006,"" Japan's Ministry of Justice website, 2006"	All of your facts say that video games help. At least that's what I gather. The definition of effect is is a change that is caused by result of an action. If playing the video games means that kids are less likely to join gangs, then it had an effect on them, a positive effect. I understand your point though. Games aren't going to make kids bad, but as the debate says does it affect them, it technically does by acting as an outlet.	0
But say you have an abnormally-shaped gas cloud in space. (I'm assuming most clouds aren't spherical.) The particles on the edges would be pulled strongly toward the center, while the particles in the middle would be pulled weakly toward the center, while the particles in the center would be pulled nowhere. This is based on the location of every other particle to the individual particle in question. I perceive it as the outer particles being pulled towards the not-so outer particles, which are pulled towards the even closer particles, up until the inner part of the cloud (assuming that is where the most mass lies) otherwise you could have separate gravitational collection points within the cloud if everything is distributed heterogeneously. No, as the cloud collapses, say, unevenly, some particles would slow down because there are now particles 'behind' them because the one went too quickly. Some would speed up as those 'behind' it (behind is away from the center of mass of the cloud) moved to the front. As this goes on, the cloud should collapse until the particles are like a liquid. If we assume that there is a central mass to the cloud, yes. Unless of course the cloud has multiple large mass points which pull matter from nearby clouds towards them. I believe this is the process of planetary accretion. I looked further into it, and should add a condition: small clouds are not affected enough by gravity to accrete. They will rely on brownian motion instead. However cosmic quantities of gas should have enough gravitational pull to work as suggested. It wouldn't make sense if they did not, given the mass. Hydrogen and helium are the lightest elements (that's why a helium balloon floats [where as hydrogen balloons explode--see the Hindenburg]). They would be forced away from wherever the center of mass is, because all the heavier things (iron, nickel, oxygen, methane, carbon, gold, lead, etc.) would be moving to the center. It's like this: If you put a helium balloon on a bus and the bus suddenly accelerates quickly, the balloon would actually move forward. The heavier air is pushed to the back by inertia, pushing the balloon forward. The heavier elements are much, much fewer, yes, but that would mean what little there were should be dropped to the center much faster than hydrogen and helium. By the time the sun ignited, the heavier elements should all, or nearly all, be in the sun, not orbiting it. I discovered some considerations I failed to make. Apparently the early formation of our solar system was in the vicinity of thousands of young stars and exploding supernovas. This would trigger the birth of our sun before all mass would be pulled towards the center, and it would expel heavier elements towards it. Orbits would be affected by the sun's angular momentum, apparently. Also, the temperature of a newly born sun would prevent elements with low boiling points from condensing into the planetesimals. Number of words are a valid argument, but dialects ... I'm not sure. Most dialects tend to be less complex than their parent (Ebonics from American English, American from British, British from Saxon, etc.) Consider the diverging nature of language, and how a small population of English speakers from England diverged into an entire continent of different dialects. There isn't just one dialect in America but dozens, some are unintelligible to the uninitiated.	 Apparently the early formation of our solar system was in the vicinity of thousands of young stars and exploding supernovas. Just wondering, how do 'they' ('them' being the generic people who say things) know this? Is it becasue they looked far enough away to equate the age of the sun and figure what they see was uniform throughout the universe. Or is it because the look at the evidence and form a theory to explain it in a way that takes God out of the picture. Not that doing so is a bad thing, but it is bad to pass that theory as fact in absense of evidence.  This would trigger the birth of our sun before all mass would be pulled towards the center, and it would expel heavier elements towards it. If the sun was 'birthed' before there was enough mass to naturally light it, wouldn't the force of fusion push the vital hydrogen away from the core, making it impossible to continue burning naturally? There isn't just one dialect in America but dozens, some are unintelligible to the uninitiated. I know this, too. The list was symbollic. I obviously didn't list all the dialects and their parents.	0
That's why you listen to your priest/pope/pastor. They direct your beliefs and tell you what to think.	I already said If we can agree nobody should take just the word of a self-appointed intermediary (clergy) on what god wants for you, then really your only source is the Bible. For a religious person that is the worst possible way to practice their faith, in my opinion. It takes the word of god (or the message of allah, or what have you) and warps and adulterates it into some random, puffed up morons opinion even though he doesn't know anything more about gods will than you do. No, if there is a message to be had in the Bible individuals have to read it for themselves to figure it out.	0
 like that in women, that lack of expression tells me that they won't annoy the kahjoyddles out of me and it's a sexy look to boot. i said lack of expression. not indifference. there's so much difference! lack of expression is just... being bland. to everything. like not knowing how to react to anything at all. not being strong or whatever. not indifferent. that's what. she's not indifferent. she's just there. you wouldn't notice a difference if you put a mannequin in her place.

Difficult is worth doing. I argue that prejudice-free society is impossible. When you become a citizen, you have to accept responsibilities as well as rights. And if I desire statelessness? I certainly would not be granted it. I was born here and as such must follow all of Canada's laws. If I, along with a large group of people, attempted to form my own society comparable to the Gypsies or Amish, I would not be allowed. I would still be under Canada's laws. I would be forced to conform to Canada's way of thinking.  I care nothing for what they do, so long as it is within the confines of the law.  The government ought not even have the power to make such laws. It is an intrusion into personal privacy. Hence they should not be citizens - they don't want to be part of American society. Then why force them to be? That is how the situation should be. The law objective, the people subjective. Should not the law - at least the law in a true Democracy - reflect the feelings of the majority of citizens?	I argue that prejudice-free society is impossible. I agree. The best we can do is to have prejudice free laws. And if I desire statelessness? Then do not become a citizen, or renounce your citizenship. I did not call for people to be forced into citizenship, only for people to adhere to the rules they swear to follow.  I certainly would not be granted it.  Being granted statelessness is an oxymoron. Just take it. But do not expect the Canadian government to like it when you just claim their land for your anarchist demesne.  I was born here and as such must follow all of Canada's laws. If you don't like Canada's laws, leave Canada. If I, along with a large group of people, attempted to form my own society comparable to the Gypsies or Amish, I would not be allowed. Taking land from a country is an act of war.   I would still be under Canada's laws. I would be forced to conform to Canada's way of thinking. If you want to live in Canada then you have to follow the laws that the majority of Canadians (in theory) believe to be just. The government ought not even have the power to make such laws. Humans always gravitate towards government.  It is an intrusion into personal privacy. Without law you have no right to privacy. Then why force them to be? I do not represent the U.S government. I am merely saying what I believe should be the case, not what is. Should not the law - at least the law in a true Democracy - reflect the feelings of the majority of citizens? That is (one of) the failing(s) of democracy - it is an illusion.	0
No they shouldn't, but until they do, their tax exempt status should be revoked. Why so?

"To me the heaven and hell thing makes more sense. The entire rebirth is actually you trying to achieve some kind of ""nirvana"" or something like that but its just nonexistence (release from the suffering of this world). But if the soul lives forever why would it cease to exist? And the entire hell thing I agree is harsh, but for a reason. Hell isn't full of people who don't know about God or things like that, its full of people who have rejected God and continually do so."

"I think the very fact that 11 million Americans smoke weed, yet it's not legal, makes many of us wonder how much progress will be made at any sort of political rally. After all, people have been fighting for this cause since my mother was a child. That's why I'm not in NORML, because I honestly don't see anything happening about it; America has a vendetta against pot. Not to mention, pot has a very high number of people who casually sell, as compared to other drugs. Lots of people hook their friends up without being ""dealers"", but this makes them reluctant to openly support groups which will directly tie them to pot."	"So your basic argument is, marijuana will never be legal because it's hopeless?  To quote Philip J. Fry, ""You can't give up hope, just because it's hopeless! You've got to hope even more and cover your ears and go LALALALALALA.""  Seriously though, have the audacity to hope for more, for better. I think people are just too comfortable with the current laws, where as long as you smoke in your home, you're mostly ok. But the fact is, if you have it in your car, or on your person, and happen to have an issue with the law, then that issue could escalate dramatically on that basis.  I think for 11 million weed smokers, having only 10,000 members of NORML is pathetic. We can do a lot better. And I didn't post the entire article, because it was hella-long, nor could I find it online, but it goes on to say that to your argument of people being reluctant to support pot openly, the best thing they can do is donate money to the cause.  Pot doesn't have the mainstream acceptance that alcohol had. But research shows alcohol to be more harmful than pot, not only to the self, but to society. <a href='http://www.24hourforums.com/forum116/8554.html'>Link It makes all the sense in the world to legalize it. But yet there just seems to be so little fight in anybody to do it."	0

Capital punishment as it exists today is a laughably ineffective system. Were it possible to reliably convict and kill off criminals in a monetarily reasonable manner, I would be all for capital punishment. Unfortunately, as it stands CP is a horribly flawed system and wastes millions of dollars in taxpayer money - even more than the equally bloated prison system. So while I might support CP in theory, in practice it simply isn't feasible within today's court system. Abortion, on the other hand, suffers from none of these drawbacks unless you consider it a moral dilemma. Which I don't. (it's all about the benjamins baby)	Firstly the reason why the process of the death penalty can be lengthy is mainly because of the appeals that follows which are made by the defendant after being convicted. The burden of proof and the emphasis of the trial is based on whether or not the defendant is innocent or not. All trials are fast as guaranteed by the constitutional right which states that the defendant is entitled to a fair or speedy trial. Again it is the appeal process and not the conviction process that lengthens the time which is made by the request of the defendant and not the state. I do think the prison system will cause less money because almost all of the country's prison systems are overcrowded and this will cause an increase in new buildings for prisons, increase in annual maintenance fee, increase in finance to take care of the elderly and the sickly in prison, and also an increase in the expenses to provide meals and as we are aware many people commit crimes to go back to prison. One of the other main factor also with the overcrowded prison is that once the prison becomes overcrowded many prisoners are released back in society without even serving their time fully which can contribute to an increase in crime and social disorder. And according to a report released by The U.S Dept. of Justice, these have caused the country billions of dollars per year to maintain and control prisons which so far have had little effect. Regardless of whether or not abortion suffers from none of these drawbacks to me does not matters. What matters is the taking of the life of the fetus which i believe is and should be equivalent to the offense of murder or homicide. These young lives have committed no crime and we can make it seem as if they are not really lives but the fact is they are as proved in several scientific researches and the ruling made by the Supreme Court that life begins at conception. We are desperate to execute or imprison a person who commits murder regardless of whether or not it is a lengthy process but when it comes to abortion we talk about freedom of choice and a woman's right to control her own body along with it is a fast process?	0

Atheists don't believe in God is because there is such a lack of evidence to, and that alternative theories to how the universe was created have actual evidence to support them.	0
Actually when a baby cries it is not for pointless reasons. Then why do babies wake up in the middle of the night and cry? Why do they cry even though they've been fed and their diapers have been changed? Why do they cry even though they have dozens of toys to play with? Why do they cry for these utterly senseless reasons? Once again, at no other stage in human life does a person cry in these situations or with this frequency. They cry in these situations because their undeveloped brains selfishly wish to express without remorse to all other humans around them with how little uncomfortable they are without consideration for anyone else's feeling. Doing such a thing is pointless and needless, but the baby only has an id to psychologically function on. Older people cry more for stupid reasons than babies actually. Really? Do older people cry just because they haven't been fed for an hour? Not at all. Plus how can a baby cry for pointless reasons when it hardly understands anything in the world apart from 'eat, sleep, poop, burp' you cannot blame a baby for crying then. I'm not blaming a baby for anything. I'm just saying it cries for pointless reasons. Even when a baby can communicate (sign language can be taught to a baby) without crying, it will still cry because the baby only cares about how it feels and not about how anyone else feels.	Because it makes sense to the child to cry. And you cannot blame a baby for crying, they have to, can they get their own food? NO, can they change their own diaper? NO. Also which world do you live in???? (no offense, if grown ups don't cry in your world then i envy you) Grown ups most certainly do cry for pointless reasons. The reason for this so called 'selfishness' is only because it is too young to understand life. It only understands that it needs to sleep, cry, poop and eat.	0

No, eugenics are not ethical. Forcing sterility upon anyone sounds completely asinine. I'd like to hear why exactly this act would not be unethical. And take into consideration that morals and values are a product of our cultural evolution. If they were not meant to be what's best for us to advance ourselves, they would not exist.	I'd like to hear why exactly this act would not be unethical. Cultures change. Therefore ethics change. Therefore ethics are either subjective, constructed, or illusory. Therefore applying a subjective, constructed, or illusory system to an objective race leads to no conclusions whatsoever. Therefore, anything with a degree of ethics is uncertain. Therefore, eugenics is ethically uncertain. Eugenics is ethically uncertain, and while it's not something I support, it is neither ethical nor unethical.	0

How? The grading system makes it so that in order to determine how well the student actually did you can't look at their grades. You have to look at what kind of classes they took. Then you have to research how much those classes really covered. You can't just say, oh, that person got 10 A's they must be really good. Well that's what AP tests, SAT, and ACT are for... Thus demonstrating that the grading system doesn't work that well. If you need extra tests in addition to the grades to determine how good the student is, doesn't that mean the grading system failed?

Puerto Rico is very proud of its Spanish language and culture.Although the island is bilingual, the language of the government, public schools, courts and 80 - 90% of the residents of Puerto Rico is Spanish and around 90% of Puerto Rico's high school graduates do not speak English well. There is a bill that was sent to Congress in 2006. Though the bill has not yet been passed, officials may still again attempt to make English the official language of the United States of America. If this bill and the creation of Puerto Rico as a state were both passed we would be forcing the 4 million new citizens to learn a completely new language.	"Techinically ""forcing"" the Puerto Rican territory to learn the English language would be a good thing. English is the predominant language used for trade and business, and giving Puerto Ricans the opportunity to learn it in a school system would be beneficial. Plus, its not as though they would have to give up any of their previous culture. According to your statistics, it sounds like they actually need help learning it.

When you look at the attitudes of the southern people toward slavery you would see that they didn't like it very much  Simply outrageous, the South went to war over the right to own slaves.	Simply not true. In reality slavery was NOT wide spread in the south. First of all it was unusual to own more then 20 slaves at one time some people owned up to 50 slaves at a time but those people were the 1800s equivalent of a one percent er. 94 percent of southern family's didn't even own slaves. Why did they support the secession? 96% of solders in the confederate army did not own slaves. What were THEY fighting for? 3 slave states remained in the union. Why didn't they secede? The answer to all 3 questions is the same the south was not fighting for slavery.	0
"Whether or not abortions occur before the embryo becomes a fetus you fail to understand that these tissues are the tissues of a growing human being. So are skin cells. Seriously, follow another line of reasoning. Contrary to what many non-scientists believe, human beings are not constructed in the womb - they develop. In fact, all the major organ systems are initiated within the first few weeks after conception. Humans aren't ""complete"" until they are adult. However as a matter of simplicity we set the starting point for when human rights are granted at birth. It would cause social problems if infants were treated as nonpersons since they are external to the mother and demonstrably feel and respond to pain. A foetus has minimal development when it is aborted, and even in late stage, its brain isn't comparable to a human brain. Just because it looks human doesn't mean it is. Do you realise how complicated our brain is? How much growth it takes to get a brain like that? You can't call what a foetus has a human brain except in the most minimal sense of the phrase. What are the stages in human embryonic development? Science tells us that the heart of the human fetus begins to form 18 days after conception. There is a measurable heart beat 21-24 days after conception.  There's a difference between the tissue systems initiating and having a proper heart. Most of these systems only start to show appreciable development after at least twelve weeks. Do you see this? <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_Embryo.JPG'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_Embryo.JPG  This is what is aborted most of the time. It's not a proper human, it cannot think or feel, it is in a stage where it is basically just tissues. What part of my argument do you not get? If it isn't a human life then how come it is developing into a human being? I am getting fed up of hearing merely opinions from you.  A human life refers to a thinking, feeling, sentient human who operates independently of another body. It refers to a person who is able to grow. Human can refer to this, and any tissues that are not thinking or feeling. A human embryo develops into a human life but is presently not one. It's simple biology. ""I opened the sock up and I put it on the towel and there were parts in there of a person. I'd taken anatomy; I was a medical student. I knew what I was looking at. There was a little scapula [shoulder blade] and there was an arm, and I saw some ribs and a chest, and I saw a little tiny head, and I saw a piece of a leg, and I saw a tiny hand. ... I checked it out and there were two arms and two legs and one head, etc., and I turned and said, I guess you got it all ... It was pretty awful that first time... it was like somebody put a hot poker into me."" I don't care what a person THINKS is a person. An embryo is NOT one because it hasn't developed personhood. A foetus hasn't developed personhood. This is an embryo: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_Embryo.JPG'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_Embryo.JPG  This is a foetus: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:10_weeks_pregnant.png'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:10_weeks_pregnant.png  Again so if you are removing a fetus because only of lack of ability to think then should you remove a person who is fully paralzyed or on stroke because he or she lacks the abililty to think? It resembles a human being because it is from the human race and it is a human life. If i recalled you called that thing in one of our earlier argument human organism which means human life. So what are you disputing now? I am removing a foetus's rights because it cannot think, feel, or exist independently of another body. A person with a stroke can still think and feel. Even if he could not, he has become a person before the stroke. A person who is paralysed can think and in some cases feel. He has grown up into personhood before the condition. Being made up of human tissues and looking human do not make you a human person or a human life automatically. You must grow and acquire personhood. Well if you say they are not innocent then prove to me why they are not innocent? Did they commit any crimes or any unforgivable actions because according to you they lack the ability to think. Right? Reread: Because they are not innocent young lives. They are in the process of becoming lives. Then prove to me that they are in the process of becoming lives when their process of life has already begin from the moment of conception as is evident in the ruling of the Supreme Court along with the proof of scientific research from doctors. A life, noun, refers to a sentient, thinking, autonomous individual. Live, or alive, adjective, refer to the property of being animate and capable of metabolism. A live thing can still not be a life. Learn the subtle difference."	Are skin cells capable of developing into a human being? Were you developed from skin cells? The lump of tissues you are referring to refers to the growing body parts of a human being which is why it possesses a different human DNA and blood type. Let me ask you a question in a hospital or in executing in someone when does a doctor pronounce life and death? Isn't it upon resuming or hearing the heart beats and upon terminating the heart beats. Therefore the presence of heartbeats indicates life. Doesn't a fetus has a heartbeat? Why then if there is no life in it that there is a presence of heartbeat? Why then that if you go to a doctor they are simply able to detect whether the fetus is dead or alive in you by detecting it's heartbeat if it has no life? So then if it is not human, then what is it? Is it an animal or a plant or is it a member of the family of homosapiens? Whether or not our brain is fully developed does not matters. What matters is that we have the brain of a human being and A BRAIN IN GENERAL BECAUSE EACH OF US GOES THROUGH A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. WHICH IS WHY SOME OF OUR BRAIN ARE SMALLER THAN OTHER PEOPLE. RIGHT? I checked that picture you showed me and i recalled seeing a human body with eyes. If it is not a proper human then how come it is a human being at all? To say that it is not a proper human because it is not fully developed is foolish. You yourself called it HUMAN WHEN YOU JUST SAID IT IS NOT HUMAN BUT RESEMBLES HUMAN. ARE YOU CONFUSED ON THIS TOPIC? And next time if you want to debate me then do not use information from Wikipedia because information from there are most times incorrect since it can be written by anyone. So when a person is unconscious does that mean that they are dead? Don't someone have to do CPR to perform on them? A fetus has human life regardless of what. A HUMAN LIFE which refers to the presence of heart beat like any other fully developed human being does. Isn't the fetus able to grow. Did you not grow from a fetus? Biology itself refers to life so the fact that the fetus has life is perfectly suited to biology. In order to study me and you, who are fully developed, don't scientists have to use the concept of biology? The person you are referring to is someone who is a medical professional firstly. Because it does not have person hood does not mean that it does not possess human life when it has everything like a human being. In the same way should we kill someone who has lost their person hood when they become unconscious. Because according to the scientific research and theory, a person loses personhood when they faint or become unconscious. To understand this you have to understand that a person loses self awareness, the ability to communicate, touch or feel, consciousness or self motivation at the time of losing consciousness which is similar to a fetus in the womb. Regardless of whether or not that person with stroke is still a person but also if he loses the above elements of personhood then he is not referred to as a person. So should we eliminate his existence because of that? Again you yourself called them human and in an earlier argument human organism meaning human life which is the scientific definition of the term organism. There is a deeper context to the term life. Which person in their right mind would give a literal definition of the term than giving a deeper scientific meaning? Why don't you try to understand the terms life and live because both are used to describe the fetus which breathes, has a heartbeat and human DNA and HUMAN BLOOD TYPE AND ORGANS.	0
"Irrelevant. I just wanted to tell you, what I do and do not believe. I don't like people coming at me with shit I don't believe. It isn't based on one tiny little thing, it's based on everything from both testaments, Duh. Tiny little thing? How is the son of God, coming down on earth, through a virgin just to die on a cross for all the people's sin, then to rise from the death after three days, a tiny thing? Almost half of the entire bible, if not more, is about Jesus. Prophecies, stories and stuff about Jeuss. Christians believe in both testaments, but if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. Because if the new testament didn't exist, Jesus wouldn't exist, or his story wasn't told. Therefor christianity is based on the new testament. Because then all christians would be jews. We would just wait for the messias the old testament is talking about.  You can argue all you want, you're still wrong. Please explain to me how that is a ""fact"".

Not really considering the land was stolen from the natives  	No it wasn't, the Native Americans didn't believe that land could be property, they were alright after a while with the British colonies, especially since we brought trade.

If something has been accepted it will still cause pain whenever it is reminded, but then it is easy to just ignore it. Forgetting something very tragic is nearly impossible. The brain could probably shut it out if it is tragic enough, as much as to not remember, but it could still emerge one day and then what? It's best dealt with as soon as possible, the faster you can move on with your life. There are some things I myself would very likely want to forget, but at the same time they make me who I am, so it's not even an option.	Spongebob is the type of show that just never gets old.

One of the main ways people are encouraged to reduce their CO2 emissions is by constantly reminding them that they are saving money by doing so. This is true. Yet consider what happens when someone 'saves' money. What do they do with this money? They either spend it or put it into a bank (very few people keep their savings at home). Yet by doing either of these things, people in an indirect way contribute again to global warming. Money placed into the banking system benefits the economy, as banks use money to invest. This leads to economic growth, which, at the end of it all, is based upon a carbon based economy which releases CO2. Obviously, purchasing something has a much more direct impact on CO2 emissions - items require CO2 for their production, transport etc.  So it seems that in order to reduce CO2 emissions at all it would be necessary to entirely wean ourselves off oil. No amount of avoidance of CO2 emissions will reduce global warming unless their very source is first eliminated. But the global economy is addicted to oil and fossil fuels. How can we, as a planet, coordinate such a massive project as a conversion to non-fossil fuel CO2 free alternatives? How could countries possibly accept the economic consequences of such an action? We can't and they won't. Any attempts by average people to reduce CO2 emissions are useless, and the problem is nearly impossible to solve on a large scale. What a useless endeavor.	What?!? We should not reduce our emissions, because that would increase our emissions? We are luckily working on cleaner technologies. They will save us money. This money can be re-invested into research and development and make our technology even greener and more energy-efficient.	0

"Perhaps banning is going a bit far, but I believe that Santa Claus is more bad than good. First and foremost, it is offensive to Christians, for whom Christmas actually has a meaning, which Santa commercializes too much, distracting young children from the ""true meaning of Christmas"", which now ceases to exist.  Santa and Christmas trees actually have nothing to do with the religious celebration of Christmas at all, they are just traditions that originated hundreds of years ago and have now evolved into massive money-grabbers for department stores. Also, it can be rather painful when children learn that Santa doesn't actually exist, as well as common ways in which this occurs. It's interesting how well all people, from TV personalities to teachers, to relatives, can pretend that Santa exists around Christmas time. I was a toddler when I figured out that there's no such thing as Santa (it was just my uncle in a red jacket), and I now hate going out at Christmas time and seeing people dressed up handing out lollies and taking photos. I feel that it is disadvantaging the kids who are being brought up with a lie."	First of all, just because your childhood wasn't perfect doesn't mean that all the other people who have a good time at Christmas should go without due to your trauma. Secondly, you are right, the Christmas tree comes from the Woden worshipers who used the evergreen as a symbol for life as everything else died during the harsh Scandinavian winters. Finally Jesus was born in September/October time not December 25 which was a pagan holiday celebrating the sol invictus. In conclusion, don't be such a stick in the mud!  Pedophiles will usually work around children if they can and banning Santa will not reduce anything noticeably except the happiness of the holiday spirit	0
Oh and you can speak for all girls can you? Can you dispute me and say that no girl does that? Because I can safely argue that all the girls I have known, it has always been evident it was 'that time of the month' because they're always rude to people, really bitchy, and don't want to be kind in general, with varying degrees. What proof have you that no girl bitches about their period?	Oh and you can speak for all girls can you? I can speak for non-fictional girls. The girls you are talking about come from movies, real girls actutally don't talk about their period.  Can you dispute me and say that no girl does that?  No.. but that weren't exactly my words. I said ''girls don't do that'', which was a generalization. Generally, girls don't do that. I maybe should have added that. Of course I can't say that no girls do that. it has always been evident it was 'that time of the month'  Are you sure? I mean try to take into consideration, that this happens every fourth week. EVERY fourth week, take into consideration how often that is, and then take into consideration how many women you meet. If you think of it - every fourth woman you meet, should be on her period. Is it ALWAYS evident that she is? I bet that you heard from one or two women that they were on their period and after that ''you always know''. because they're always rude to people I would disagree, that is also fictional. What proof have you that no girl bitches about their period? First off - I never really said ''no girl'' .. but whatever. I am one, I live with 5, I have tons of girl friends, I talk to them everyday, and since I talk to them everyday, I rarely know when or if they are on their period, which should prove that they don't always bitch about their period, I have periods myself, and it is no big deal .. it is just something that comes every month, like payment.. you don't see people bitching about their payment EVERY MONTH, do you? People bitch about their payment sometimes, when the discussion starts.	0
What he was advocating was not important. And neither is Rome's use of that tactic. Those are not relevant pieces of information. I don't think you know how a battle works. It not lord of the rings. You don't just have one big last man standing clash. Its a matter of fighting over days or weeks. Sometimes months. This is why leaders are important. Politics effect a number of things. Foreign resource intake. Officer assignment. What units are held in reserve as reinforcements and which are on the front lines. Soldier moral is greatly affected by the political relationship between the Generals. If you have to Generals who are politically at odds then the soldiers may desert or may not cooperate, food may be horded which weakens the formation. Thats especially problematic in places where your army isn't unified. Places like Greece.	You were the one who went off track, I was merely responding to the points. And we aren't talking about a siege battle here, these were mostly open field battles. As for the politics, that is all relatively minor, plus any good general would give himself the best chance of victory over petty politics.  In any case we are talking about battle between romans and greeks(albeit the term had no meaning to the people of the time), and what history shows is the Romans winning the battles, politics and salting the ground and civil wars are irrelevant. That would be relevant if for an overall campaign, but set piece battles are fairly straightforward	0

you bought into the sleight of hand that business freedom equals individual freedom. Our political freedom is derived from the economic freedom that was and is prevalent in Great Britain. The law protected landowners' rights. And in England land is king. So each landowner was his own master, thus we have political freedom.	Our political freedom is derived from the economic freedom that was and is prevalent in Great Britain. The law protected landowners' rights. And in England land is king. So each landowner was his own master, thus we have political freedom. A perfect example of the sleight of hand I was referring to. Simple sanity check: To whom do anti-trust laws, minimum wage requirements, subsidy laws, etc. apply to? A. A person living in a middle-class home who works under an employer. B. The business that employs person A? Therefore who is being restricted? Business B. Person A need not obey anti-trust laws, pay a minimum wage or face stiff penalties, apply for subsidisation, etc. These laws restrict the business, not the person. Therefore, according to our little sanity check, what you said is erroneous.	0

(just for personal research)	Of course...Government will be always there.. but they way they govern differs depending who is leading or handling the governing matter. There will be good, there will be bad...depends.. what I mean is the good or bad is temporary depending who is the the ruling person as a person.	0

Well, that's rather compassionate of you, then again you want to punish others for not being so compassionate... which is simply violence. Which makes you no better than these criminals in the first place. Also, I'm sure you know which cities in your country have the highest crime rates. Can I assume that you've chosen to live in the most crime filled area of the most crime filled city since not doing so would be ignoring crime?	Why would you be compassionate to a criminal, unless you are a criminal as well. It is not violence to enforce the law.  I live where I do because it is where I landed. Found work here and so I am where I am. I am not in law enforcement and so I do not look for criminals. If I happen upon one, I do my part.	0
"This is simply not the reason that Pangaea broke up. This concept is your invention, and you hoped no one would know any better. Fortunately, I know better. I happen to be taking a geology course right now. I've already taken a geology course. And simply taking a geology course does not mean that they are automatically correct. Continents break up due to ""rifting"", that is, a parting of the earths lithosphere due to the earths internal processes. Not a mythical flood 4000 years ago, duh. Have you heard of isostatic adjustment? Psalm 104:5-9 refers to it; this explains how pangaea could have happened. As a second note, there are many theories as to why continental drift happens: there is not just one. Evolution is an extremely slow process. In the big scope of time on earth, that fictional flood just happened yesterday. Yet, in reality the earth isn't that old... but who's to know? This argument is boarder line retarded. If there was a land bridge, kangaroos would end up on both sides of it. Why are kangaroos only in Australia? And why do you say that? Your logic is totally flawed, of course you are not basing any of this in logic, you are trying to make scientific fact work into your silly book of fairy tales. It makes you look ridiculous. / What the fuck is ""speciation""? Did you just make that up too? And that is where I take my leave."	I've already taken a geology course. Then why is it you don't know anything about geology? Why is everything you say completely inaccurate? Where is your supporting evidence?  Yet, in reality the earth isn't that old... but who's to know? People that know their geology. The earth is about 4.54 billion years old, as anyone that has taken intro to geology knows.  Have you heard of isostatic adjustment? Psalm 104:5-9 refers to it; this explains how pangaea could have happened. I have in fact. Isostatic adjustment is a glacier process. It does not cause continental rifting.  As a second note, there are many theories as to why continental drift happens: there is not just one. There is no debate about what causes continental drift. Zero controversy. (supporting evidence below) Every ocean has a mid-ocean ridge which is a rift that is still spreading and creating more seafloor all the time. This causes the continents to continue to move apart. Look at the diagram in the link so that you understand. Any person that knows even the basics of geology, knows all of these things. I simply do not believe your assertion that you have taken a geology course. If so, you must have failed it horribly, because you clearly have no knowledge of geology.	0

The majority of the world is not Christian and does not celebrate Christmas. <a href='http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/'>Source is Pew Forum Christmas is also not just a word. Wishing someone a Merry Christmas who does not believe in it is insensitive not only to whatever beliefs (or non-beliefs) that person holds, but to the history of oppression that person has likely experienced at the hands of Christianity in the United States. As a queer person and an atheist, I have personally faced legal and social discrimination and hatred my entire life because of religion for no other reason than that I exist. Wishing me a Merry Christmas is, at best, trying to wish me well through the very institutionalized religion that has oppressed me my entire life. It would be like a man wishing women a happy man day or a white person wishing racial minorities a happy white day.	"I think you're missing the point. I said the majority of the world calls it Christmas... and by ""it"", I mean Christmas. So, the majority of the world calls Christmas, Christmas. That makes sense, right? If you put up a Christmas tree and decorate it, put presents underneath it, put up Christmas lights, listen to Christmas music, tell your kids Santa is coming and so on... which holiday does that sound like? There's only one that I can think of that consists of those exact same things... and it's Christmas. Why take away the term if you're going to celebrate it the exact same way as Christians?  Many people wear green on St. Patrick's day, despite the fact that they aren't Catholic. Would you avoid telling people ""Happy St. Patrick's Day""? Maybe you could take away the ""Saint"" and just call it Patrick's Day lol.  The term Christmas doesn't have to mean to you what it means to Christians, but if you're celebrating it the same way, call it what it is! All that being said, if you don't partake in any tradition that is just like Christmas, then of course wishing you a ""Merry Christmas"" would be dumb."	0

I need to make a correction to what I said earlier because I have accidentally (I was tired) misrepresented what I believe. I do not view gods as conscious beings. Instead I suppose they are belief complexes hosted by conscious beings. Further, I believe that since only conscious beings are capable of knowledge, gods (as I understand them) cannot be knowledgeable, powerful or benevolent at all, let alone maximally. Speaking of conscious beings as a class, this class, I think, does possess all the knowlege there currently is, and weilds all the (conscious) power there currently is, and expresses all the benevolence there currently is, but not all that is possible.

"Conflicts? The bible talks about that. Its dates often contradict as well as the numbers of troops and usually has some supernatural thing tacked onto it. It isnt a trustworthy source for that kind of information especially compared to historians writings. Daily lives? It does touch on that. Yeah not really! The old testament doesnt really have anything describing the daily life of the average Jew and the new testament just follows jesus around. Again, historians reports are far better. Culture? Majorly touched on that Ill grant you this one, however i again need to mention that it isnt specific to the bible. The historians writings have culture in it too. Agriculture? I have no clue It doesnt really say more than ""Cain brought a sheep for slaughter"" so i guess it does say they raised sheep. but the historians actually have accounts of what crops are grown where and what livestock are raised, their farming techniques, and so on.  Relations? Like relationships? no like relations with other countries and nations. The bible doesnt really talk about government and politics at all and it often gets relations with other nations wrong. There were never any masses of jews in egypt for example. So another point for historians whos main bulk of the writing is about politics and government works. So basically blah blah blah the bible is religious so it loses all accuracy. No, its inaccuracy makes it lose all accuracy. When it stacks up to the facts it usually fails.  They are writing down what they went through from there perspective. Correction. Someone was writing down what they thought people said about people who may or may not have existed and what they may or may not have thought they saw or heard. And anyways THEIR perspective isnt really important when you gather that they believed in a space wizard who birthed a son that did magic tricks. They sort of lose credibility. Its still a trustworthy source to study the mindset and cultural differences between nations back in the day. Not compared to the accurate writings of historians as well as government records from nations. The spiritual ramblings of ancient jews in a holy book isnt a credible source even if it does get a couple things right. After all it is supposed to snip bits of history and place it into itself. We dont want snip bits. Snip bits of fact among non-facts are not credible when compared to almost completely factual accounts.  It doesn't have to be an exact day to day basis. It can just tell you what that person has experienced.  If we can A) prove that person actually wrote the book. and B) That what they saw or heard wasnt only what they THOUGHT they saw or heard. A history book informs and so does a bible. Yes but in different ways. Im talking about where it is best to go to get facts about a whole range of topics from a trustworthy source. That would be from historians. If you want some fact and culture mixed with deluded perspectives about unfactual happenings then the bible is your source. If you are persuaded by it then thats on you. I hope you dont mean that its my CHOICE whether it persuades me"	"Its dates often contradict as well as the numbers of troops and usually has some supernatural thing tacked onto it. It isnt a trustworthy source for that kind of information especially compared to historians writings Two different authors. Two different perspectives. Many translations. Typical Atheist. Yeah not really! The old testament doesnt really have anything describing the daily life of the average Jew and the new testament just follows jesus around. Again, historians reports are far better. I clearly said it touches on that. These authors wrote things to the public and to churches which pretty much gave a description of their lives. So again, think for at least 5 seconds. Ill grant you this one, however i again need to mention that it isnt specific to the bible. The historians writings have culture in it too. You act like I am saying the bible is better. Or that history books don't have the information.  It doesnt really say more than ""Cain brought a sheep for slaughter"" so i guess it does say they raised sheep. but the historians actually have accounts of what crops are grown where and what livestock are raised, their farming techniques, and so on. The bible does mention plants and stuff so.....idk. no like relations with other countries and nations. The bible doesnt really talk about government and politics at all and it often gets relations with other nations wrong. There were never any masses of jews in egypt for example. So another point for historians whos main bulk of the writing is about politics and government works. What if historians were wrong? What if the bible is wrong? Idk. I don't care. No, its inaccuracy makes it lose all accuracy. When it stacks up to the facts it usually fails. Dude, its an account of the perspectives of different people. So its accurate.  Correction. Someone was writing down what they thought people said about people who may or may not have existed and what they may or may not have thought they saw or heard. And anyways THEIR perspective isnt really important when you gather that they believed in a space wizard who birthed a son that did magic tricks. They sort of lose credibility. Space wizard? What the hell? Typical Atheist. A wizard is not a god. God is supposed to be outside of space and time. He is not a space wizard. Why do you guys always just go for the insults? And perspective is important if you want to know what people think. Not compared to the accurate writings of historians as well as government records from nations. The spiritual ramblings of ancient jews in a holy book isnt a credible source even if it does get a couple things right. Yes it is. Its a personal account from the jews. Its still a personal source of info from a perspective. We dont want snip bits. Snip bits of fact among non-facts are not credible when compared to almost completely factual accounts Example: Bible: Courtney fell. History book: Courtney was running from wolves. She tripped over a large stick and fell and got devoured.  Still sounds fine to me. Sounds like they just left out some information. I really don't care. Courtney still fell. If we can A) prove that person actually wrote the book. and B) That what they saw or heard wasnt only what they THOUGHT they saw or heard. So then scientists can study it and figure out what made them think that. Still works as a source of study too. Yes but in different ways. Im talking about where it is best to go to get facts about a whole range of topics from a trustworthy source. That would be from historians. If you want some fact and culture mixed with deluded perspectives about unfactual happenings then the bible is your source. So again blah blah blah bible is mush. I have heard enough of that. I hope you dont mean that its my CHOICE whether it persuades me If it gets you it got you. Thats it dude."	0
Absolutely not.  HOLY COW, no.  I've never understood this viewpoint. The media does tend to sex women up. How that equates to victimization is the part I've never quite gotten. Because they sex men up too. And sex sells, so it's obviously not offensive to us, to the contrary we seem to enjoy it (even if we don't want to admit it outloud).  Women who are able to make money off of men's desires for them are anything but victimized. They are fortunate and smart.	"The mainstream media not only has the capacity to perpetuate, but does perpetuate phallocentric ideas that reduce ""the woman"" to object, and subliminally reinforces classical gender associations that betray modern wisdom. Because we live in a male dominated society, the sexualizing of women becomes systemic, a part of the cultural institution that the sexualizing of men does not lead to. Sex sells when it involves women, primarily--because they have become objects. And in spite of the female contribution to modern society, we have historical baggage that is now lengerie'd and gussied up by the media to sell to men. Moreover, despite the fact that some women are in positions of power, and some make money off of men, it does not mean that they--as a group--are not victims of a greater system of stratification, objectification and oppression."	0

Oh bullocks. The founding fathers were British citizens when they signed those documents. Can you say hypocrite? I can. It is a damn stupid rule and it needs to change. Who the fuck cares where someone was born as long as they are loyal to their country.	Actually they relinquished they'r British citizenship once it became clear the war was about independence from Britten. Just saying. I do agree this could work if the child was just born some where els but raised here because that would be virtually no different than being a natural citizen. but any farther than that it's just to risky.	0
Actually it's not a fraud, because kony is real. Some twitter tweets says that he is dead, but no one is really sure because Joeseph Kony is invisible to the government and other people. He could still be alive or dead. It's not a fraud because someone could be pretending to be kony and children in uganda is still fearing from kony. He is likely not a fraud. Also the invisible children group is a non profit government organization which gets money to help the children in Uganda to have a better life and be protected from kony.	not kony himself but the movement is it used to get oil reserves in Uganda?	0

It depends. When did she cheat? Ten years ago, or last night? How long - was it a one night stand, or months or even years-long? Was she drunk or under the influence of drugs? Did we argue, with me giving her reasons to think that it was 'over'? Under those circumstances, I may continue it.	2 - length of cheating period - the longer the period, the more disgust I might feel, but we're not talking about level of disgust so a one night stand would also affect trust and so I'd call it quits.	0
I haven't seen those figures. Could you cite them? To the 7 million figure. It is doubtful that that is included in the 47 million, but I'd like to see evidence. Those 9 million on Medicare don't count in that figure (do they?) this push towards universalizing health care is for those just above the bottom and in the middle. As for the 20 million would earn twice as much as the poverty line. This may be true. But does that figure mean that those families can afford adequate health insurance? Next, we have the most competitive insurance system in the world. More competition wouldn't necessarily lead to lower prices. And if you say that the government needs to force employers to offer medical insurance, aren't you just agreeing with the idea that people should have coverage? As for immigrants. True they don't contribute taxes, but they add money to the system in another way. Their cheap labor save companies money and in turn save consumers money with cheaper goods. If all of our goods were produced domestically only by citizens, we would be paying more for products. And if you think that God only wants Americans to have health care and not immigrants, than that is either a racist or nationalist God. Shouldn't He love all His people? As for crappy situtions, true some people don't seize all of the opportunities that are presented to them. But perhaps you think that the will can triumph all. It can do a lot, but not everything. And even if they make the wrong choices, wouldn't God exercise forgiveness and present them with more opportunities?	Here are some sources for the medical numbers (and the some more stats behind them)... <a href='http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2007/20070718153509.aspx'>http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2007/20070718153509.aspx  Also... The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group often quoted in news reports, puts the number of uninsured Americans who do not qualify for current government programs and make less than $50,000 a year between 8.2 million and 13.9 million, far less than the mantra of 40 to 50 million. Next, more competition typically leads to better value or lower prices. We also need to work on better disclosure, so that consumers can actually comparison shop. The way healthcare is now, this is much harder to do. I love what immigrants do for this country. But if they want to be covered by our healthcare, they should pay in for it. If they are illegal and can't pay in, then they shouldn't have the privilege that US citizens have. Why is that unfair? And some people are offered way too many opportunities that they continue to pass up. Either way, all i'm saying is that most people put themselves in the situation they're in. Last but not least, I believe the government should force employers to ATLEAST offer some kind of coverage. But I don't believe in government run healthcare ala France, England, Canada, etc...	0

"Yeah, this is a really dumb debate.  I mean, people we know are going to die whether we're alive at the time or not. Like, me dying won't magically make someone else not die. So if given the choice, why the hell wouldn't you want to live? Please, ""seeing the ones we love die, wah!"" lame. I wonder if anyone else sees how incredibly self-centered this debate really is? Think about it. The idea is, the people who would like to die now want to do so in order to avoid facing the death of others. Meanwhile, we know the death of others is inevitable. Everyone dies. So what's the point whether you're around to see it or not? Are you so important, or such a martyr, that you're too special to have to go through that pain? What's so great about you, that you shouldn't have to go through what everyone else does? Of course given the choice, almost everyone will choose to live forever, I suspect even those who say they would not. Get over yourselves, and you'll get over people you know are going to die as well."	iamdavidh, Been here for a year and call others lame. Lame is clearly the words of loser.

It isn't their fault that the government made an idiotic decision.	Two things. First, in a democratic society citizens get the government they choose. Citizens in democratic societies cannot deny responsibility for the actions of their government. If you consider soldiers also citizens capable of thinking and moral scrutiny, then neither bear responsibility too. Second, even if it isn't their fault the government made an idiot decision, that doesn't mean they have to execute idiot decisions. A soldier has the free will to be military disobedient in agreement with her/his consciousness.	0
Outrage is not the same as rage. Rapists are sex offenders so they are put on a list, due to them not being trusted. No such list for atheists. I have never seen religion come up in my professional affairs and very few of my personal ones. Hence I have not been discriminated against. The idea of goodwill toward man involves strangers. That's why holiday wishes are a statement about the wished. Shall I ask your religion before I greet you? I just don't want to offend.	Outrage is not the same as rage. Grab a dictionary. Outrage is extreme anger, so is rage. They are closely related at least, synonyms at best. Either way, my point stands that you are projecting a feeling onto to me which I have neither expressed nor demonstrated.  Rapists are sex offenders so they are put on a list, due to them not being trusted. No such list for atheists. You are absolutely missing the point on the research about atheists, if not actively trying to distort it. I have clearly explained it twice now. I have linked to the resource substantiating it and further explaining it. If you do not get it from all of that then there is very little I can do and even less point in trying to debate with you. I have never seen religion come up in my professional affairs and very few of my personal ones. Hence I have not been discriminated against. Good for you. I have. Knowing that most Americans/Christians distrust atheists more than any other group is an obvious basis for concluding that being openly non-theist will more likely than not lead to discrimination. That you have gotten lucky or not been as open about your views hardly contradicts research or my personal experience, the former being something you have not refuted and the latter being something you cannot. Shall I ask your religion before I greet you? I just don't want to offend. Yes, you should. For the express reasons that I have already detailed and which you have not directly countered. Or just don't wish me a Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday... wish me a plane old good day. The simplest form of goodwill wishing.	0

"1) I believe that the universe has no explanation (existential nihilism) and it makes perfect sense to me. 2) If there is no proof of a beings existence and if there is a very high chance that the being does not exist (through logical argument) then a person has every reason to deny the existence of that being.  3) You do not need faith to deny the illogical. Example: The pine cone is not a dinosaur because it is impossible for it to be a dinosaur. Not, ""I have faith that the pine cone is not a dinosaur"". See how stupid and illogical that sounds? 4) I am not Agnostic. 5) I noticed that you describe god as a him. You are acting like the very stereotypical blockhead of a christian. Why can't ""god"" be female? Or maybe no gender at all?"	"@Idiotobx914: 1) I must be misunderstanding what existential nihilism is, or you are misunderstanding what it means to have no explanation. What the Cosmological argument means by ""explanation"" is like this: You are on this earth because your parents had sex and gave birth to you. Now it gets more complicated and more intricate when you go further back in time, but that is essentially what I mean by explanation. Not that we have a purpose necessarily. 2) What is the very high likelyhood of some sort of God existing? 3)I agree with that. But the existence of a God isn't necessarily illogical. 4)Ok. What does this have to do with the debate? 5) It doesn't matter to me what ""gender"" God has. I believe that if one exists it is most likely above our comprehension. I suppose it would have been more ""correct"" for me to refer to God as ""it."""	0

Switzerland is the only peaceful country on the planet. Heaven is described 4,000 years ago by the prophet Job as the abode of God. There is no proof of reincarnation by animal or human.

but how many people would pass those courses if they do not have the hands on experience Every person within the virtual medical field must still physically pass all tests required of their field of interest, as in an EMT would have to do all necessary physical tasks before being certified.

If 100 people took online classes, paid the tuition for online classes and especially in a time of enconomic constraints and hardships, take the tests, how many of those 100 do you think will actually pass those tests?

1.) Convince fat man to voluntarily sacrifice himself to save teens. If he refuses, do nothing. 2.) If, despite his close proximity, neither he nor anyone else hears or responds to all the shouting; wonder if it's all just in my head. Do nothing. Assuming this is not in my mind, and time is of the essence, then my reaction would likely be one of instinctual reaction rather than rational thought. In this case, a couple possibilities: a.) If all involved are complete strangers... do nothing. b.) If at least one of the young teens is not a stranger, odds of pushing the fat man increases with closeness of relationship. c.) If at least one of the young teens is a close relative or friend, the fat man dies with almost 100% certainty. I think this is probably how I would realistically react if under pressure with no time to think. Interesting to consider why I might react this way, and how I might act differently if there were more time to think and consider all the variables.	thats very... literal.

And yet it is all conjecture. There is not even proof that a single 'civilization' exists aside from Humanity (if we can even be called a 'civilization'). All this is equally a conjecture. If they exist, then why not? Isn't there quite a bit of evidence to suggest that - if the do exist - they have visited? No. If we can destroy ourselves now, then why are we not currently 'advanced' enough to destroy them? Maybe they have technology capable of rendering useless our best weapons. so they'd want to get rid of us NOW, while we are not as powerful. Why do humans believe that everything unknown is a threat? Androids, aliens, etc. Here's a hypothetical situation.

"Yeah the president is black, so what! In fact, to put that in the pro sides advantage, our president has been accused for many crimes by Republicans, conservatives, Tea Party activist, etc. So, overall, just because your the president it doesn't mean anything. Its a victory for black people in America, but that is just one person, not the majority of African Americans. White guilt is NEVER over. Although, many white people have finally made sense that the division of the American nation has brought nothing but conflict, there are still supremacists who disagree and have a flame of hatred towards colored people that it will never go out. There are still racist confederates, KKK, the racist kind of skinheads, and the Neo-Nazi who are all still existent today that hate African Americans or of that descendant. The fact you said that it is ""stuff that can't be helped"" is truly what bothered me the most from your argument. It can be helped and my evidence is the history of America in the 1960's where civil rights movements ""helped"" elevate black people and color people in general. In the end, black people (but really it should say colored people in general) have been treated unfairly. I wouldn't say like bullshit, as we already achieved our rights during the 1960's. Yet, we still face prejudice from white people, but know that I am talking about a certain group of white people, not as a whole. I am not as rash to say all southerner whites are racist as its not true at all."	I have noticed that every president gets accused of crimes. The president being black is a sign that the white supremacist thinking in the country is much lower than it was previously. Obviously it is getting better and better all the time.	0

How can time be both an illusion of the human mind and at the same time be part of the fabric of the 3 dimensional universe?	"This 3 dimensional universe is also an illusion, of sorts. Absolute truth is pure mathematical reality. It exists in nothingness. There is not time or space in the void outside of the universe. The universe is created of matter. But in order to do this, it had to be separated from Anti-matter. If you put them together, they consume each other. There is an universe out there somewhere, that is made of the anti-matter that is the ""evil twin"" so speak of this universe. In the universe is also ""anti-time."" In a sense, matter is space. There is space between the bits of matter and it takes time to get from one bit to the next bit. The human mind did not invent time and space. But time and space are part of the human illusion. There are layers of reality that are not 3 dimensional. For example: According to Einstein (I think) time is the 4th dimension. 3 dimensions is HxWxD. Add to that ""time"" you have to consider where each objects and what shape it is in in the past or the future. Some people say that the universe is a still frame picture show that products new frames at the rate of about 200 billion frames per second. Most scientists just say it's an illusion. Time is a relative element to consciousness. For example: Humans can see about 16 frames per second. Our consciousness really cannot see anything faster then that. A house fly can perceive hundreds of frames per second, which is what make them so hard to get. Flies could time their flight through a slow moving fan blade, which would whack us every time. If the consciousness could speed up it's ability to perceive objects, so to speak, time would slow down. Time is largely relative to the consciousness perceiving it."	0
How is a getting a haircut not the same as changing your gender? Haircut makes you look different with that people perceive you differently. Gender change makes you look different and perceived differently.  Your hair before you decide you cut it is from when you were born (the genetics that determine how long it will get). Your gender is determined by genetics as well. Maybe parents have fond memories of their child when their hair was short but not when it was long?  Maybe parents have fond memories when their child was a nice bookworm not when they were a rockband enthusiast? people change because they feel like it and/or the situation around them makes them change. If parents can not accept the fact that people change and 'grow up' then they should not be parents should they?	"How is a getting a haircut not the same as changing your gender? Haircut makes you look different with that people perceive you differently. Gender change makes you look different and perceived differently. Because your hair and your penis are two totally different things. Example: Susie gets a haircut. ""Hey Susie, nice haircut!"". Susie gets a gender change. ""Hey Susie, nice penis!""... and then of course they all carry on like it's no big deal. ""Don't worry Susie! Your vagina will grow back!"". Your hair before you decide you cut it is from when you were born (the genetics that determine how long it will get). Your gender is determined by genetics as well. Maybe parents have fond memories of their child when their hair was short but not when it was long? It's not like your hair goes from black and straight to red and curly. It grows and you get a haircut. Your penis grows in a different type of way, but when you cut it off... it doesn't grow back. Maybe parents have fond memories when their child was a nice bookworm not when they were a rockband enthusiast? people change because they feel like it and/or the situation around them makes them change. If parents can not accept the fact that people change and 'grow up' then they should not be parents should they? All of that is minor compared to a sex-change. Changing is part of life. 100 years ago, sex-change wasn't even an option."	0
Xbox 360 is better because xbox is innovative and has fun creative new features such as xna which is the service that allows users to create their own games for xbox marketplace and the review other peoples. xbox is also cheaper. ps3 steals everything that nintendo does such as motion sesitivity) because they are lame and uncreative. ps3 also has no rumble, which is a feature that has came standard on every comsole since the n64. xbox cares about their costomers, sony does not. dont contribute to the theft of other peoples good ideas.	"Cheaper doesn't mean it's better. Usually the more expensive things are better. PS3 didn't steal Nintendo's idea on the motion sensor either. PS2 had used the playstation eye way before Nintendo came up with the Wii, so really, Nintendo ""stole"" it from the PS3. It's not really stealing either, they just improved it. And if that's what you think, then XBox also ""stole"" the idea from PS3 since the Playstation Eye is exactly the same, just not as ""advanced"". And what do you mean by ""rumble""? Do you mean vibration in the controller during gameplay? If so, PS3 DOES have that, they have two different kinds of controllers, 6-axis and dual shock. 6 axis does not have rumble but is very light-weight. Dual shock has rumble but is a bit heavier."	0
The way you phrase it is very strange. I am not sure what you are complaining about other than American's talking about the atheist/theist debate, as if both sides have nothing to share.  While i do think there are some absurd issues (the whole war on christmas thing), I think it is important that Americans voice their opinions (resonably) so that we keep other people's perspective on the matter in our minds so that one group is not under/over-Representative.	""" I think it is important that Americans voice their opinions (resonably) so that we keep other people's perspective on the matter in our minds so that one group is not under/over-Representative.""

"No it does not fit you failed to include the one child policy in your equation :/ You provide a claim. I say your claim may be false, and provide a very good reason. You say ""No!"". So, I will continue to disagree with you. I would argue that what people personally want would be a much stronger motivator than what the law says, so my example is strengthened by not bringing in the one child policy into the equation. No it doesn't go against the statement it's just including it within the other possibilities :l If you keep naming different reasons, don't they start to not have any bearing on the situation? Yes I did, but that does not mean that the idea is 100% successful. You are only assuming that's what i meant. :l Wait, what? We are talking about it being successful at all, not 100%. You claimed you never said women wouldn't have children. You didn't claim that all women wouldn't have children. Stupid proof thing? What is so wrong with asking for proof? Good question, why did you get so upset with me when I asked you? If someone gives a belief it is kind of stupid to ask for proof. If you ask for evidence or reasoning it isn't so bad. But, you use the word proof for situations that can't be proved. I overreacted though. I thought it was something you had been doing over and over again.

"When have I ever tried to paint Christians as ""cruel cold hearted bastards""? No atheist in the U.S. could ever think that without being a very lonely unhappy person, seeing as something like 75% of Americans are Christian. Go ahead and continue generalizing about what Atheists think about Christians, since you probably have such insight into the topic. As far as muslims go though...why on earth would you group every muslim into the category of an extremist? Were you making a joke, or just being intentionally inflammatory? I'm going to assume that you were joking because I really don't want to believe that you could be serious."	I had thought that the way in which I had written it was a display of irony. Basically, I said why non-Christians dislike Christians and then, being a Christian, I write the exact sentiments by which Christians regard non-Christians. However, I do still believe that Christians are far more tolerant than Muslims. By the way, why do you so loathe generalizations? You bring it up at every opportunity.	0

When people die they go to the gates of Heaven. God judges them and sends them to Hell for violating His rules. How exactly does Hell exist because of Satan? And why would God send anyone to Hell if he didn't create the place? Unless you are arguing that Satan created sin with the whole apple thing. You didn't actually propose your reasoning for how Satan has anything to do with the creation of Hell.	Hell had to be created to send a third of the angels and Lucifer. This happened before man had sinned so technically yes, Satan was the reason Hell was created.	0

Offshore drilling is a short term solution to a long term problem. America only has 3% of the world's oil supply but we consume 25%. How can furthering our dependence on oil solve that? Not to mention the environmental impact of petroleum based fuels. He is instead investing in alternative energy which is a much smarter idea. Relying on oil to solve our energy crisis is about as stupid as investing in pagers 10 years ago. I'm not sure why specifically you think his economic plan is bad. Please elaborate.

Name one instance where you have won an argument ;)	"•Akulakhan(2302) Disputed 1 point Thats an impractical and irrelevant question: for there are no perfectly identical twins. And that's avoiding the problem; the problem still remains. You made an inherited claim that the genetic code from one individual isn't adequate to create another human, when the individual his/her/itself is the converse example, a contradiction. In fact, the reproduction of genetic code from a single code, is called cloning. And if there were, then it would still be irrelevant, for the sperm would be an extension of that person's, which ever twin it happened to be, self Which again changes nothing, because the clone is just as ""being"" as the original. 1) We have no absolute rights. So why would it matter if the fetus was some precious human with dignity and importance? 2) Nothing, except God, is sovereign Everything but God is sovereign. If no one talked about God, He'd be non-existent within one generation. 3) Sovereignty, in the sense of commanding one's life in the narrow sense of how we perceive, does not necessitate the affirmation of ""right,"" in the constitutional sense. 4) Ability to act does not necessitate the [being] of those same types of rights either. And again you are shooting yourself in the foot. So you are telling me you don't believe that a sovereign individual is necessarily entitled to rights? Then why not abort after birth? Physically healthy, maybe so. But physical goodness does not necessitate moral goodness. This is a separate debate I'd love to have later, would be too much fun. •lolzors93(1561) Disputed 1 point I'm not going to debate with you. You, unlike most people, have good points.

Ok let me rephrase injesting (that could be eating or drinking) the Flesh of your own kind is cannibabilism, drinking blood that could be from your own species or any other species is vapirism it's really that simple	If you feed off of your own species by consuming some parts, including blood, you are a cannibal. It's that simple. This vampirism crap comes originally from superstition, old stories, even cannibalism itself. It's been used to create further fiction and now people are misusing that word, obviously. If someone says that sucking another human's blood is vampirism it doesn't change the fact that it is cannibalism, simply more specific as there's only blood involved.	0

"Time is not a property of the universe. Time is basically an illusion, it does not really exist, if there weren't that which enable change there would be no such thing as ""time"". Structurally our universe is made of matter and energies which react and affect each other, which causes them to change their location, their consistency, etc. There's no ""time"" anywhere. Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed. I'd say time is change, of everything. But then why call it ""time""? Also then time would not apply to only our universe, as not only here happens change (assuming there's more than just this universe). Humans created time. Even though it is useful."	"You basically say in your argument that time exists: ""Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed.""

"To me, it would be a good thing if religions admitted that they have no idea on what God is thinking. That is not the case, however. In pure logic, the assumption that God exists would be followed by the fact that ""if God exists, we have no idea on what he's thinking"".  The religious make their own rules, and if we're debating religion itself it would apply more to the tactics of God. But to say ""God doesn't exist because evil things happen"" or ""Even if God does exist, he doesn't care about us because evil things happen"" is like saying ""I know what God's intentions would be if he existed"". It's intellectually dishonest. There are more logical reasons for not believing in God. Because bad things happen to good people is not one of them."	"I agree with your saying that the most rational stance is ""we have no idea how God thinks"". But like I argued, skepticism is not a practical stance to take, whether in or outside religion. Unless you subscribe to the school of thought that says we shouldn't attempt to find out anything about God at all (and it doesn't seem like you do, since you said there are some good reasons for not believing in God), you'd need to suspend your skepticism somewhat when debating religious issues. To say anything at all about God would be intellectually dishonest, if you take intellectual dishonesty to be assuming that you know something then arguing as though you do in fact know it. (Although I don't think this is dishonesty - it's just an omission of the disclaimer that you can't really know this or really know that, an omission that everybody makes all the time and assumes that you will be making too. People don't formulate all their factual sentences like: ""I think my name is Ben but I could be wrong"", ""I think it is currently five o'clock but I could be wrong"", ""I think the earth is round but I could be wrong"", do they?) Anyway - under your concept of intellectual dishonesty, any argument, logical or evidential, for or against God would be intellectually dishonest, because how can you know that God is limited by natural laws or by logical possibility? It's easy for us to imagine things violating the laws of nature - like Moses parting the Red Sea - so we tend to assume that God is capable of such feats. It's not easy at all for us to imagine things violating the principles of logic, like a circle being square, or God in his omnipotence being able to create a rock so heavy that he can't lift it. But just because we humans with our limited minds can't imagine a being that transcends logic doesn't mean this being does not exist in some way. Indeed, I think this is the very reason that God, if such a being exists, is ultimately inaccessible to us: he crosses every boundary of human intellect. The argument from evil cannot ever be a infallible argument against God. But in this respect it is no worse than any other argument that concerns God, as they are all based on either logic or empirical evidence, neither of which are infallible when applied to God. As these fallible arguments are the best that we humans have got, they're what we must work with. Whoever it was that said we should be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains fall out, has it right: there are just some things, like skepticism, that we have to close our minds against, if we are to say or do anything useful."	0
When we are talking about life fromed from a natural human reproductive, then why is the distinction between natural and artificial is unimportant when abortion has to do with natural and not artificial. So you said it yourself again, so the fetus (human) has a heartbeat which maintains blood flow which is critical for life of the fetus? You said people who have coma has lost the functions of their brain but the brain is not fully gone. So, again this is my question to you; Even if they are not gone, they are still not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts, right? And this is similar to a fetus which has an intact brain with the presence of life but is not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts. An unconscious person at the time of losing their consciousness has lost their personhood according to scientific studies and legal examinations because at the time of losing consciousness their brain has temporarily shut down causing them to lose all the abilities or elements of personhood. If a brain dead person cannot recover then how come in many cases brain dead people have recovered as in a case recently with a man becoming braindead but recovered after being in a major accident. You are causing a blot on the name of science. Are you saying that if the DNA identifies you as a different but living human that you should also disregard this? You are failing to realize that the lump of tissue you are referring to is the growing human body and you keep making reference to other tissues as if they can grow into a human being as well.  Cloning again has nothing to do with sexual reproduction. Cloning is basically a copy of the DNA to produce humans with similar identity. Cloning is done by an artificial method whilst sexual reproduction is done within the human body and formed from a combination of reproductive cells. Tumors are tissue growth i agree but you are making it seem as if the cells of tumors are formed from sexual reproduction. The growth of tumor tissues are caused by exposure to harzardous elements and chemicals or nuclear matters. Maybe we should start seeing if tumor cells can develop into a human being and if it also has developing organs, because you are comparing them to a fetus. If the procedure is limited the whole fact is that they are still using them for clinical trials and this can have a major impact on the human systems and besides we all are aware that in a clinical trial, patients are exposing themselves to the risk of abnormalities, risks or body damage. So where are the rights of personhood or living rights?	When we are talking about life fromed from a natural human reproductive, then why is the distinction between natural and artificial is unimportant when abortion has to do with natural and not artificial. It doesn't matter whether the abortifacent is natural or artificial. So you said it yourself again, so the fetus (human) has a heartbeat which maintains blood flow which is critical for life of the fetus? The foetus gets its fluids from the mother until it has a functioning heart. You said people who have coma has lost the functions of their brain but the brain is not fully gone. So, again this is my question to you; Even if they are not gone, they are still not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts, right? And this is similar to a fetus which has an intact brain with the presence of life but is not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts. A person in a coma has a brain which retains their identity as experiences. They have legal personhood too. A foetus has a brain that isn't fully formed and has no identity yet. An unconscious person at the time of losing their consciousness has lost their personhood according to scientific studies and legal examinations because at the time of losing consciousness their brain has temporarily shut down causing them to lose all the abilities or elements of personhood. You misunderstand. Higher level functions shut down, however the brain still operates. If a brain dead person cannot recover then how come in many cases brain dead people have recovered as in a case recently with a man becoming braindead but recovered after being in a major accident. You are causing a blot on the name of science. A braindead person cannot recover. That's what being braindead means. What could happen is that a person is misdiagnosed as braindead. Sort of like a century ago when a person might be misidentified as dead when in reality they were comatose. They would wake up sometimes. It isn't that dead people can recover. Are you saying that if the DNA identifies you as a different but living human that you should also disregard this? You are failing to realize that the lump of tissue you are referring to is the growing human body and you keep making reference to other tissues as if they can grow into a human being as well.  All that matters here is that they are tissues without identity. A human being isn't born with an identity and functioning brain. There are stages, a foetus is the stage when it's not really a person. Cloning again has nothing to do with sexual reproduction. Cloning is basically a copy of the DNA to produce humans with similar identity. Cloning is done by an artificial method whilst sexual reproduction is done within the human body and formed from a combination of reproductive cells. It doesn't matter if cloning is artificial.

Maybe we should start seeing if tumor cells can develop into a human being and if it also has developing organs, because you are comparing them to a fetus. A tumor, like a foetus, is unconscious tissue. It doesn't matter if foetal DNA is different, all that matters is that both are in a state of no consciousness, no identity. If the procedure is limited the whole fact is that they are still using them for clinical trials and this can have a major impact on the human systems and besides we all are aware that in a clinical trial, patients are exposing themselves to the risk of abnormalities, risks or body damage. So where are the rights of personhood or living rights? Those people are given consent forms. A foetus has no ability to give consent because it isn't a person.	0

"So in other words... ""Lock up people who disagree with my political views, in the name of Liberty and Freedom!!!!""

But it is unfair for their political views to infringe on my economic view because you want more government in economics. I am all for social freedoms. I am all for the separation of church and state. Matter of fact, religion is scam. Freedom of speech shouldn't be restricted and people may assemble with they please and anyone has the right to own a gun.	0
There's no fundamental gap between living and non-living, or animate and in-animate for that matter, so basically, we are just as much alive as a stone. The reason why we think there's a fundamental difference between the stone and us is simply that we are unfathomably more complicated than a stone, but there is no fundamental difference; simply, the stone and the person are at two different extremes of the same spectrum. So since the term 'living' is essentially an empty concept this automatically clears up any difference between 'living' and existing. There's no difference between existing and living.	The difference is that something can exist without living. For it to be living it must have life force. A stone does not have life force. Something that is living is also existing, but not everything that exist is living. That's the difference.  Everything exist, but not everything lives.	0
Pretty vague question. Are you saying that you believe that the debate on theism/atheism that Americans in particular have is less substantive than in other countries? If so, in what way(s)?	I find their arguments far less substantive. All both sides seem to really care about is trying to demonize the other. Whereas outside the US we focus on philosophical aspects of the debate and trying to inject new arguments into the god/no-god debate. We also tend not to (I'm coming at this from a theists perspective) try to conflate atheism with Stalinism and religion with extremism. We're not focused on the actions of each group; but the philosophies of each group.	0
Of course he can, he can stop existing by willing himself to not exist. He does not exist physically, so he is already dead. If that does not fly to you, dead can mean inactive and to a lot of us he is inactive, so he is dead.	Then, if you think that is what it means, then go post on the other side. You don't have to tell me. If there is no specific description as to what the topic-maker means, then you can take it as you will. I stand by my first argument.	0
The Saudis are going to win any awards for civil rights, that's for sure, but I wouldn't say they are massacring their people... people aren't being gunned down in the streets like in Yemen and such.

"If girls can do things that are geared to guys, thanks to progression, then why can't guy do things that are geared towards girls? Your logic is poor. Yes girls CAN play those types of video games, so guys CAN watch things like MLP. And it's not their problem that there are narrow-minded people like you, that is YOUR problem. You should let people do as they please. I know countless of guys who enjoy MLP, and the fact that they watch the show has nothing to do with their sexual preference, and out of all the guys that I know that watch MLP only one is interested in other guys.  The real problem here is that you're using the words like ""homo"" as an insult. That's small minded in itself."	Video games have a spectrum from girls games to guys games. A girl can play them without it going against the norm because there are specifically girls games. But MLP is a specific show with no spectrum. It is geared so far away from males that when a male DOES watch it and enjoy is and even get off to it, the rest of us normal people who get laid turn around and question. It's wierd. It's gross. It's gay. Enough said.	0
Don't get me wrong, I understand suicide. I feel like trying to break this tie, so I'll be the Devil's advocate here. If anyone wants my real opinion, message me. Yes, it can be seen as cowardly. You're leaving the hard times without thinking of anyone else and you're not standing to fight. Hence, cowardly.	"Devil's advocate position noted, disagreement as follows: Suicide is a consequence of fundamental changes in both brain chemistry and brain structure, resulting in a distorted view of reality and self that makes suicide seem like the only actual option available to a person. Suicide, then, is less a consequence of individual choice and more a result of neurological changes outside of the control of an individual. If any entity is truly to ""blame"" I would point my finger not at the victim but at the society that persists in its ignorance and stigmatization of mental illness and its failure to produce an even remotely adequate system of mental health care and treatment. Also, most people who commit suicide do consider those they are leaving behind and generally leave notes to that effect apologizing."	0

Switzerland is the only peaceful country on the planet. Heaven is described 4,000 years ago by the prophet Job as the abode of God. There is no proof of reincarnation by animal or human. Humans naturally want to live forever hence the creation of the concept of reincarnation. Jesus promised to all who believe on Him that they will dwell with Him forever in Heaven. No one has ever been born as a cow or mosquito and spoken that life is hard.	I think we have more peaceful countries in the world. Let me think... Iceland? Uruguay? But anyway, if you born as talking mosquito i'm shure you will be talking all the seconds of your life about how hard is to be a mosquito.

Yes but the debate just asks if men should have much more of a say in the decision of this child.	Since the man technically made the baby by fermentation he should be able to weigh in on the decision for an abortion or not right? Sorry for being so technical but it asks if she should weigh in on the decision for abortion. Since the abortion is an all or nothing choice the answer comes down to his say or her say, so I personally don't believe he can add anything, even if it is his DNA. Yet I understand how others would disagree with me, stating that it his dna.	0
I am saying that there's no distinction between being alive and existing. In other terms, the set of things that are alive are exactly equal to the set of things that exists. My point is that since there is no difference between life and non-life all we are left with is things that exists. I am not claiming that computer viruses don't exist, I am claiming that these 'non-living' things are just as alive as human people.	So you are saying that there is no difference from a living organism and a cup? A cup can not reproduce into more cups.  there are obvious differences.	0

"""mistaking the executing of the person and the appeals process that follows because it is not the death penalty itself that is expensive but the appeal processes that follows."" I consider appeals part of the capital punishment process. Either way, you're just arguing semantics. ""For now the death penalty might be expensive but studies have shown that the costs for prison functions will increase since it is already increasing yearly and added to that will be the additional costs for fighting crimes."" Okay, capital punishment might make sense one day. That doesn't particularly matter to me. The point of this debate was whether or not one can logically oppose it while supporting abortion, and I believe you can. I also think you can use logic to flip that around, or perhaps oppose or support both at once. There are decent arguments for both sides (well, abortion anyway. As it stands, CP is dead in the water) and it's a pretty tough issue to debate without a lot of free time.

 Somewhere in your bloodline is religious followers who passed down their morals. And where did those morals come from? And so on and on. But this is no ad infinitum. The social contract is the reducible starting point of morality. But whereas morality presupposes philosophy, religion does not presuppose morality. The belief in a higher being and institutionalizing a series of procedure or criterion relating to that belief don't automatically dictate any moral code. Religions are tools of mental coercion, adopting whatever tools its creators deem necessary to fulfill their ends(whether they be noble in nature or not). Maybe you think you received your morals from society... well where do you think their morals came from? My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists—and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values imply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride.  Ayn Rand I am trying to get you to realize that although you are an athiest, your life has been greatly influenced by religions.  Influenced yes. Dictated morally? Not at all.   For adultery to be commited, one must be married, correct? So if marriage is a religious tradition and adultery is seen as immoral, wouldn't that mean that this view stems directly from religion? No. Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). Given the territorial nature of primitive creatures, I don't doubt that the conclusion that a mate should be exclusive to oneself predates religion by quite a considerable degree.	And where did those morals come from? And so on and on. This is a common argument. It is true that even nomads had a certain degree of morality. But you are missing my point. I am not saying that all morals are directly influenced from religion. Religion helped spread certain morals. Our ancestors lived in a world governed by religion. Now you may think religion is a tool of mental coercion, but imagine if there were never any religions. There could be some positive aspects, but there would also be very many negatives as well. What is right and wrong would not be as emphasized as it currently is.   Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). It is pretty well-known, that the world was once a much more sexist place. Men saw women as lower than them (this is still relevant today if you look at NewLee's debates), and rather than marriage being purely out of love, it was more of way for men to claim a woman as their property. Now you can argue that maybe stealing was seen as immoral before religion, thus meaning that adultery is a form of stealing, but I think it stemmed more from disappointment. For example, say you are a caveman who just made a new tool. This tool gets the job done and you find that you are satisfied with the results it gives you. You go to sleep and awake a few hours later to find that one of the other cavemen stole it. Now ignoring the fact that a caveman wasn't nearly as intelligent as we are today, he would not have looked at the other caveman and considered what he had done to be wrong or immoral, he would have been upset that his tool that he enjoyed so much, is now being used by somebody else... Not him. What is moral and what is immoral, were labels developed by religions. Influenced yes. Dictated morally? Not at all. Not at all? Now that is something you cannot know. Like I've already said, not all morals come directly from religions, but many do. No. Coming to the conclusion that adultery is wrong, immoral, or unconducive to the human condition is entirely possible without the influence of religion(especially considering the most famous and bizarre examples of adultery come from religious figureheads). Without religion, adultery would not be a term. Even under a different name, it still would not exist. Marriage stems from religion. Adultery stems from marriage. Commiting adultery is breaking one of the ten commandments. So marriage came from religion, and so did adultery... so how is adultery not one of the morals gained from religion? As for the religious figureheads commiting the most bizarre cases of adultery, well then they obviously aren't the most faithful followers of their religion, are they?	0

"We all know that God created marriage  Incorrect. Humans created marriage.  and when two people get married God is in the middle.  Uninvited threesome? Creepy bastard. Stick to ghost-raping virgins will you? So why is it that gays that don't really care for God, the bible, and etc Well some gay people do care for god, for some reason. With your description I honestly have no clue why anyone gay or straight would care for any of it. why would gays want to be apart of this holy union? From your description who would not want to be apart (meaning away from) this ""holy"" union... unfortunately you mean a part, as in be involved or part of this ""holy"" union. Anyway. 1. If there were a god he'd not be so mean and so petty as to care which two puny mortal humans wanted to spend their life together. The god you describe doesn't exist, and if that god did exist he'd be a horrible being not the least bit worthy of worship. 2. It's perfectly possible for one to believe in a god who doesn't care whether someone is gay. 3. Marriage in no way inherently has anything at all to do with any theology. It can simply be a custom or ceremony or commitment.

"I think it's really strange that even though telling everyone Merry Christmas is a Christian form of inclusion, they are now expected to not say it at all, in the name of inclusion. You think they are being insensitive but there is at least a 78.4% chance that they are being kind and neighborly.  So 78.4% of the population should stop with their otherwise pleasant greetings because less than 1/4 of the national average won't fit the demographic that it applies to. Furthermore, Holiday greeting cards should acknowledge the fact that religion has pushed bigotry and/or oppression. This is non-sense. If you want Christmas cards of apology then make and sell them yourself. Your post is full of hyperbole. Atheists are trusted less than a rapist? What are you in the atheist registry?  I'm not a Christian. My uncle told me I was going to hell and my friend told me ""Merry Christmas"". I was offended by one and pleased with the other. You need to figure out who is deserving of your outrage (Hint: it shouldn't be Christmas).  I have also been told Happy Hanukkah and I believe I got a Happy Ramadan. None of these are offensive. How bout some religious tolerance."	Again, you insult your own integrity by grossly misrepresenting what I have said. I have already acknowledged my understanding that most Christians are well-intentioned when they say Merry Christmas. In fact, that was the very first thing that I wrote. My express point was that there is a difference between intention and actuality. One can mean well and still be insensitive and intolerant.  My argument is not and never has been that anyone should stop saying Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays altogether, but that they should not go around saying it people they do not know and frequently have never even met because of the oppressive history religion does have.  I also never suggested that greeting cards should be altered, or asked that they acknowledge the oppressive history of religion. I could honestly care less what the religious send to one another.  My statement that atheists are trusted less than rapists is not hyperbole. Please do some research; you can start <a href='http://digitaljournal.com/article/315425'>here. If an atheist elects to be open about their non-belief, and I do, then discrimination is a guarantee.  I never stated that I have any strong emotion on this issue, let alone rage. I presented a calm, rational breakdown of the historical influence of religion substantiated by facts and reason to demonstrate why my stance has a legitimate basis. Asking that people tolerate my non-belief is not being religiously intolerant. At no point have I suggested that the religious should be silenced, discriminated against, or otherwise treated unfairly. All I have argued is that people not assume I am religious and ignore the negative impact religion has had on my life and the lives of others. That does not seem unreasonable to me.	0
Untrue. AIDS Cocktail, penicillin, Lipitor, and insulin all failed in animal tests. Scientists used back channels to push them through to the human trial stage, anyway.	And where did you get this information? I would greatly appreciate if you provide the source of it. One thing is for sure.. Insulin doesnt have to be tested with animals because people have insulin in their body, its either they lack insulin or they have an excess insulin level in their blood.

Jesus' teachings are prevelent in everyday society. People are anti- gay, anti- abortion, and a number of other things that embody ideas proposed in the Bible. A number of commandments are laws of numerous countries too. Without Jesus, there would not have been a Catholic church to shape the ideas of midieval Europe and the Americas. His teachings have become the norm of numerous societies. Jesus did not fail just because the world isn't a peaceful and moral place, but he influenced the ideology of billions.	I'm not arguing whether or not Jesus had an affect on the world, he obviously had a huge affect, but was that his real purpose? If you're Christian, and you believe that his main purpose was to save us from our sins, as srom suggests, then I would agree, he did accomplish that. But, if you look at the events that have happened since his death, events that God would have been able to foretell, it's hard not to think that maybe God was trying to prevent some of this from happening, and that Jesus's execution cut those plans short.	0

"Perhaps banning is going a bit far, but I believe that Santa Claus is more bad than good. First and foremost, it is offensive to Christians, for whom Christmas actually has a meaning, which Santa commercializes too much, distracting young children from the ""true meaning of Christmas"", which now ceases to exist.  Santa and Christmas trees actually have nothing to do with the religious celebration of Christmas at all, they are just traditions that originated hundreds of years ago and have now evolved into massive money-grabbers for department stores. Also, it can be rather painful when children learn that Santa doesn't actually exist, as well as common ways in which this occurs. It's interesting how well all people, from TV personalities to teachers, to relatives, can pretend that Santa exists around Christmas time. I was a toddler when I figured out that there's no such thing as Santa (it was just my uncle in a red jacket), and I now hate going out at Christmas time and seeing people dressed up handing out lollies and taking photos. I feel that it is disadvantaging the kids who are being brought up with a lie."	Boohoo..would you like a tissue. Finding out that your parents...or uncle is Santa Claus is not that heartbreaking, I don't see many people committing suicide because they found out that Santa wasn't real. I found out when I was young, but I didn't go crazy over it. Saint Nicholas or Nicholas of Myra was actually a christian Greek that gave presents to people and performed many miracles.

If it wasn't for Lincoln the south would likely not have seceded and we would have been able to abolish slavery peacefully instead of starting the bloodiest war in American history. Hindsight is 20-20 ;)	During the First bit of the Civil War, Lincoln actually took to the field to command troops. The union was also loosing in the beginning... Hindsight is 20-20 ;) So you think the south would have still have left (which they were allowed to do) if Lincoln didn't show up and act like a Federalist and try and shove laws down their throats? They weren't the Slave States of America, they were the Confederate States of America, they were sick of states rights being stepped on.	0
You are quite simple person :)	You are being stupendously arrogant. The nature of the existence of time has been, and still is debated within philosophical and scientific circles. This is a question with no right or wrong answer, an answer that would require knowledge of the one true epistemological position. Unless you have that (in which case what are you doing on here, go get your Nobel Prize), your answer is no more valid than anyone else's, thus your tone is too officious for one who doesn't actually know the answer.	0
So I can't use my bible as a resource but you can use Darwin's book as a resource to throw evolution at me how is that fair. God is like love it's just there you can't see love but you just know its there.	"You didn't answer any of the questions I asked, showing you don't really know how to rebut an argument. So I can't use my bible as a resource but you can use Darwin's book as a resource to throw evolution at me how is that fair.  No, you can't, as there is no proof to back-up the Bible. The Romans kept very detailed records of what happened in their times, and none of it relates to the Bible. If it was as big of a movement as it was in the Bible, you would think someone would have it on record, but no, it's not. Is there any way to prove that we were put here in seven days by a deity in the sky 4000/6000 (depending on which story you believe) years ago, or that this ""loving god"" flooded the Earth, killing everything but two animals per species (which in itself is impossible) and a small family? Is there any way to prove any of this happened? I'm waiting. God is like love it's just there you can't see love but you just know its there Proper punctuation would have been great to help follow what you are referring to here. Just because you think it's there does not mean everyone does (""you just know its there""). Since I can't help you realize you're somewhat hallucinating here, I'm not going to go further on with this particular sentence."	0

I'm pretty sure the debate was meant to be about human life since fine-tuning of the universe it is a common creationist argument, and I think it's pretty safe to assume based on the debate creator's profile pic and debate history that was their intention. Regardless, I don't see how the possibility of other types of life forms changes anything. Even if other types of life forms can exist there is still no evidence that the universe is fine-tuned for life of any kind.	Maybe but the title says life, not just human life, so i took it as that.	0
Two things. First, in a democratic society citizens get the government they choose. Citizens in democratic societies cannot deny responsibility for the actions of their government. If you consider soldiers also citizens capable of thinking and moral scrutiny, then neither bear responsibility too. Please study democracy further. That's not how democracy works, specifically there are many types of democracy and in our democracy (I assume US democracy) it is based on representatives, meaning that the government we get is never truly what we want but instead a compromise between what our representatives want and what they promise us in order to gain our support. Second, even if it isn't their fault the government made an idiot decision, that doesn't mean they have to execute idiot decisions. A soldier has the free will to be military disobedient in agreement with her/his consciousness. The military doesn't work this way, sorry.	"""Please study democracy further.

We do not participate directly in decision making but we 'delegate' this to a selection we consider to be the most capable to decide for us. BUT does this mean citizens (either from US of NL, like me) can lean back, close their eyes and ears and wait for the next election to pass their judgment? Of course they CAN (physically), but it doesn't mean it is right. As citizen you never delegate your conscience or your individual responsibility. If the government you choose decides to exterminate your neighbor and the rest of the minority group in your society he belongs to, can you just tell him: ' I'm sorry man, this was not what I truly wanted but a mere compromise... Bad luck.' ?  Civil disobedience, resistance, petition, demonstration, collective actions: your civil and political rights do have a purpose. ""The military doesn't work this way, sorry."" -> That things don't work in a certain desirable way doesn't mean we cannot condemn it. Perhaps the concept military apparatus - with it's hierarchical structure that relieves everyone within from any individual responsibility should be seen as the left-overs from the pre-modern era where the idea individualism still had to be invented - needs a rigorous update."	0

Oracles are a big part of Tibetan culture. The Dalai Lama consults him the same way that he consults his cabinet. He's just looking for another opinion. Dalai Lama made it clear that he does not bow down to Nechung, but rather vice-versa. Apparently he has known Nechung for a while and considers him a friend, but does not worship him. It sounds to me like he's just trying to be respectable to an old friend.	The point is Nechung is non-Buddhist so should not be consulted by a Buddhist figure. And DL bases his decisions on what the oracle says so yes he does bow down to him and using an oracle to decide matters of state is wrong and this is an oracle which has caused much harm in Tibetan history.	0

Overall Government, in the order I think is worst from worst being first on the list. Government (power) Money (money the means to power) Religion (Religions the means to get money) As for Alex Jones, this dude is a bag of half truths and flat out lye's, I followed him for a few years, it was only until I started to look into him then I saw he isn't what he claims to be, in the end he is a right wing Christian loony. What got my attention was when I emailed him a few years ago as to why he never talks about the Zionist, I get perma ban from his you tube and blocked, that was the day I thought something was fishing, theory is he is on the Zionist payroll, I have no hard proof but after that and the things he said he lost all credibility with me.	This isn't about Alex Jones. It's about the statistics. If you have complaints about Alex Jones take it up with him. I have him here reading out the actual statistics about this issue and it is completely relevant. You yourself are not 100% credible and unless you want to be taken seriously I suggest you give some leeway in this case. The video is spot on the numbers.	0

Were is your evidence that in 2001 the country was overrun by terrorists and insurgents? <a href='http://www.cfr.org/publication/9513/'>here is the Council on Foreign Relations own description of Iraq's involment in terrorism - the biggest indictment - that he supported groups that were against his regional foes; that's exactly why Iraq was our ally in the 80's (we gave them guns, anthrax, West Nile virus, botulism, etc.)	I never said Iraq was ever overrun by terrorists. All I mentioned was the possibility of these terrorists entering the country and taking it over if we have no presence. In 2001, it was run by Saddam Hussein. Being run by other anti-American groups wouldn't be much different. I merely eluded to the fact that Iraq, like most of the middle east, is not very supportive of America.	0

A bottled water from a store is about $1.39. $3.75-$1.39=$2.36 extra going into the pockets of private owners. Don't buy bottled water. Oh, but that's a regulation. People like you can't stand regulations until it helps you out. That is offensive because I never said that government should be totally absent. $100,000 park for 50,000 people. What land is that? Imaginary. A nearby suburb city has a 900,000 budget for 17,000 people at $52 per person per year, but some people pay less than others due to property taxes. So, some have to pay for others to visit the park at a discount rate. How is that fair? So, if that same parent goes once a week, that is one dollar. However, based on the socialized math, why should that parent get cheaper leisure just because they have more time than I do. Ex. She goes 100 times in a one year, that is only .50 per visit, but if I go only once, that is a expensive park visit of $52.  If private companies were to compete for that those parks, they could easily provide a service at a lower cost. If one dollar for daily fee, then once a week, then $100 a year is a fair price. Nowhere does it say that leisure parks must be public. Name a leisure park that is not public.	Name a leisure park that is not public. My neighborhood has a park.	0
Social Networking Sites are a great communication tool that helps us stay in touch, discuss assignments and projects, receive announcements and organize events.

Another reason why social networking is not beneficial: <a href='http://www.livescience.com/2744-athlete-smarter.html'>exercise helps the mind. If the students are indoors using their computers or laptops to social network, they are neither studying nor exercising: the two things that may help academic performance.	0
Puerto Rico is very proud of its Spanish language and culture.Although the island is bilingual, the language of the government, public schools, courts and 80 - 90% of the residents of Puerto Rico is Spanish and around 90% of Puerto Rico's high school graduates do not speak English well. There is a bill that was sent to Congress in 2006. Though the bill has not yet been passed, officials may still again attempt to make English the official language of the United States of America. If this bill and the creation of Puerto Rico as a state were both passed we would be forcing the 4 million new citizens to learn a completely new language.	The reasonable implementation of a nationwide decree that entails that certain conditions and changes be made by the public should not be an obstruction in the decision to pass that decree. If Congress failed to pass laws that required a large amount of people to change a major part of their lives, then the Amendment banning slavery would never have been enacted. Therefore, the argument that incorporating Puerto Rico into our 51st state and requiring the people to learn English is wrong is invalid for English is already one of the primary languages of the world and having them learn it would provide more benefits than negatives.	0

So, should we also help those being killed in Syria and Bahrain? What about the Congo and the Sudan where killing has been going on for years? I'm not trying to be a jerk... just wondering why Libya? We can't help everyone.	There are plenty of reasons, oil is one, although not that important in this conflict it can still not be neglected i.e. ensuring its price and security of supply i.e. stability is another. They also want to maintain a good foothold in the region, the US and nato want to show that they're in control of the situation. Also, i think there may be an element of divertin attention from the fact that they (US mainly but France and UK to) are backing the very dictators that are massacring and repressing their people i.e. Bahrain, Yemen, Saudi Arabia. Not syria obviously, thats why is receving so much air time on Western media.	0
I wasn't arguing for people being able to marry animals, I was arguing to make bestiality legal. Recognizing the right of two different species to be in a consensual relationship. I'm actually more opposed to necessitating marriage as the demonstration of a committed relationship.	Human beings are the only specie except dolphins, who have sex for pleasure. So unless your partner is a dolphin, I don't see how you could prove to your judge that the animal actually likes the sex. Animals use sex only for one reason, and that is to reproduce, they have no other reason to mate, and animals can't reproduce with human beings.	0
If it's a true generalization then it's a fact. I don't think those cases are relevant because we can't properly understand these people. We have no means of knowing whether they actually have a desire to continue living. Since we can't know much about them it's better to exclude them from this particular discussion.	Well for one...how can you even prove that everyone has the desire to live? What evidence is there that proves that to be true? Both rhetorical questions. You can't. So your generalization can be dismissed.	0
You make a logical argument challenging God's existence. That said, assuming His existence and that He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, what is your answer?

I've already said this before. I am not a Creationist, but a Catholic whose Church already accepts most forms of evolutionary science. I personally am aghast at the complete lack of evidence for the two engines of Darwinism- namely random mutation and natural selection. Random mutation = still-born mutant offspring, natural selection = rare instances of overpopulation	It's not like pokemon. A random mutation might be an bird with just a slightly bigger beak. After several generations, that change is a lot more noticeable. That's why Darwin proposed the theory. He saw birds with small beaks starve, and saw the entire population change how they looked, and when the softer food came back, they went back to normal. If the famine hadn't ended, the birds with bigger beaks would have to compete against each other to find mates and avoid starving. It is a very slow, gradual process. I would expect a lot more change in 5000 generations than one or two.  A massive mutation will usually result in a deformed baby, but a small one, like having ears positioned slightly different, allowing you to hear better is just a small one. If anyone can expand on this, go ahead.	0

Teenagers are not responsible.Most government's have decided that the Internet does more harm than good. one in every 25 teens had problematic Internet use.

No. Go back 6 million years ago, when the first humans emerged with Chimps. Did,they believe in God,No!! But a few million years later we do?? Isn't that weird.

Ok, so theoretically if you have a kid... and he one day does something that you think it bad such as cheating on a test... or stealing a car... would you hate him? No! you would disapprove of the actions that he did and probably punish him, but not hate him! And yes, I do have several gay friends, and we have discussions about Christianity and everything! I dont hate them at all! Just like I dont hate the sexually immoral, even though I think its wrong!	See, this is why I wrote that first statement. It's incredibly illogical. You have such a corrupt sense of morality. Would you be the sort of person who would have fought in the Crusades because you felt it was God's will? I mean, you need to see it from a more neutral perspective.  Cheating on a test? That is bad for a good reason. That means he's not learning and he's using other people's work without doing the work himself. Stealing a car means he's taking something from someone else. That's unfair for the other person. Being gay has no negative. That's why it's not wrong. - I highly recommend you think a little before you say something. I mean, answer this honestly: Is your morality straight out of the Bible, or did you think of why good things are good and why bad things are bad on your own? Do you just follow the Bible, or do you actually try to find reasons why being good is being good and being bad is being bad?	0

The rules were made to be broken; that is, the rules could never have been followed in the first place.

As for the rest of it, I did address your issues. Whether you choose to see through my eyes is another matter. I am saying, according to Christians, the rules were made by God, and they were intended to be broken. No human could ever live up to such standards as they would need to be absolutely perfect, which is impossible. Thus they are all guilty of sin, and then they go to Hell because of that. Perhaps the confusion comes from your misunderstanding of the religion itself. I won't educate you on this, but I do advise you look into it a bit more. You might learn something beneficial, who knows. And yes, I meant that last part in the nicest way possible.	0
That would be like saying humans are equal to God. There are very few cases when the creation is superior or equal to the creator.	"I'm not going to make this a debate about religion but to refute your point, some of us do not believe in a god, so saying we're equal/superior makes no sense. As far as the creation being superior to the creator, if you think of evolution as a process of producing gradually more complex lifeforms over time, then it's very possible the creations can outperform their ancestors/creators. Of course a lot depends on how you define ""superior"" too. If you're talking about outperforming their creator, a calculator can do math much faster than the engineers who build it."	0

Think a little bit more about it. Imagine all of the suffering you would have to live through. You would have to live through the lives and deaths of everyone around you. For me it would be pretty cool for a while, but then it start to be quite torturous when I am the last person alive in the world.	"I don't agree with you. Watching everyone we care for die away one after another is for sure, sad, but we're also capable of adjusting to it with a great sense of acceptance and wisdom if we allow ourselves. However, I'm going to take into consideration the stories I've seen in movies of people (or creatures) that live forever, and none of them are happy about it. It becomes mundane, lonely, miserable and feeling like you're in a trap if you live forever. Personally, part of the beauty of life is that we all die. We have a rough time frame to make the most of our life and it's a lesson to not take anything for granted and fucking ""LIVE.""

I see, my mistake. If you remove the dog DNA nucleus of an egg cell, and replace it with a cat cell, the resulting cell will be 99.9% cat, but it would not grow into a baby. This has been done with a human cell and a cow cell. So, if DNA were the main cause of body shape, that should grow viably. But it doens't. That is why I'm hesitant to believe evolution. The Cambrian Explosion has too many new body shapes in too little time. Random mutations cannot account for that. If you are talking about trying to fertilize a dog egg with a cat's sperm, it would not work because of the abovementioned genetic divergence and chromosomal disparity. I understand this part, yes. That's why, well, we can't do that.	I'm sorry, I don't understand why you think a somatic feline cell injected into a dog's egg should grow into an embryo. Or what the Cambrian Explosion has to do with that.	0
I posted this side as you said in the debate title to look at this from a Christian perspective which I think would prevent you from sinning.  My own personal view is that we all have our own personal heavens which are chock full of all the stuff we enjoyed in life, my type of Heaven would probably be a real Rock N Roll bar a bit like the Titty Twister from Dusk Till Dawn minus the Vampires, either that or Valhalla. I also believe in reincarnation and Nirvanna and was told by a Hare Krishna Monk when I asked him what Nirvanna was like and he replied it is full of good food and women so beautiful you would cream your pants that also sounded like a good version of Heaven.	either that or Valhalla. I upvoted you for this, specifically.	0

"You talk of these things as if it's absolute but you fail to take in consideration how you can only go by you're mere senses when talking about something. They're all you have. Some things, are beyond human senses and for most, understanding. You will continue to talk about the passing of ""moments"" as being time flowing but again this is simply how your mind has grasped a phenomena. Not the absolute reality."	" but you fail to take in consideration how you can only go by you're mere senses when talking about something. We can also go by Einstein's special theory of relativity, the mathematical equations that support it and other equations valid to the subject. We can go all of the NUMEROUS lines of evidence that show the passage of time before humans came along. We can take two hyper-sophisticated timers, perfectly synchronize them and predict how quickly and much they will go out of synch if you keep one stationary and put the other in a shuttle. Each of these can be repeated and independent of any one person's particular observations.  Some things, are beyond human senses and for most, understanding.  Like the electron. Nobody has ever seen one, and we can never know for certain where one is at any given time, yet we can know how many there are involved in molecule, we know all kinds of effects they can have. There are well beyond our human senses, but not entirely beyond our understanding.  You will continue to talk about the passing of ""moments"" as being time flowing but again this is simply how your mind has grasped a phenomena. Not the absolute reality. I have an idea where you are going with this, but I don't wish to put words in your mouth. Please explain more so I can properly respond."	0
"You did not do a single thing I asked of you. People claim that they have evidence that points to his nonexistence. So show me the evidence. That is all I ask. You answered in the ""Here is the evidence"" column so be productive and give me some evidence. Otherwise don't bother saying anything."	He actually made a reasonable point. It's common folk logic that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but that that idea is incomplete. Absence of evidence isn't deductive evidence of absence, but it's actually true that absence of evidence can be inductive evidence of absence. So to be a little less technical this means that if I have searched my room for a diamond the size of a fist for the last couple of years, then I have inductive evidence that there isn't a fist sized diamond in my room. What it doesn't mean is that I can be sure that there isn't such a diamond in my room, i.e. I don't have deductive evidence for the absence of the object. For more than two thousand years we haven't seen reproducible evidence for the existence of God. That amounts to a strong inductive claim that there isn't a God. It doesn't however, mean that we have deductively shown that God doens't exists.  All the confusion we see in these debates arises from the fact that theists believe they have deductive proof that God exists. Deductive proofs inherently out compete inductive proofs, so theists tend to think they have the stronger position. Theists on the other hand haven't ever been able to reproduce their deductive evidence, and that's why atheists are skeptical. Because of the amount of opportunities theists have had to reproduce their evidence, atheists have a strong inductive claim against the existence of God as discussed earlier.	0
"By your own argument, men are just as victimized as women in the media. Look at the sitcoms. King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, etc. They all show the men as dumb, lazy, sports-watching goofballs who need their wives to keep them in line.   So stop with the ""females are the only victim"" stuff. Men are portrayed in just as bad, if not worse, stereotypes in the media."	"That's really not my argument. Are men socially disadvantaged by these ""stereotypes""? Not like women are, no. Men aren't victims of sex discrimination, sexual harrassment, or sexual abuse in the way that women are. Men don't find their social roles constrained by inappropriate gender norms in the way that women do. So as I have said before, while both genders are to some extent stereotyped by the media these stereotypes are nowhere near as overtly dangerous to men as they are to women, nor are the images of men so one-dimensional. At the same time you have ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" you also have ""The Apprentice."" Men in GQ are clothed; women in Cosmo, just barely. Men do not appear in advertising as ""arm candy"" or as body-parts used to sell unrelated products. So no, by no stretch of the imagination is media stereotyping of men ""just as bad"" as that of women. As an example, look at how Pyg claims with a straight face that ""any psychologist will tell you that women are much more emotionally unstable [than men]."" In fact, pretty much any psychologist will tell you that's just complete and utter bullcrap. Pyg doesn't cite any psychologists, he just adopts this totally erroneous claim as fact because that's how women are represented to the public mind in media imagery, so therefore it must be true. I don't see any equally outlandish claims about the inherent traits of men being advanced. So again, no, by no stretch of the imagination are the effects of media stereotyping of men ""just as bad"" as the effects of the stereotyping of women."	0
"Thank you. I don't mean to come across as insulting, just provocative. If one, like one the other side of this debate does, defines religion as anything done religiously Then sure, everyone has something or many things they do religiously, and in that sense, okay they're religious. I argue that someone who is atheist ought to subscribe to a definition of religion that is also atheistic. Strangely most atheists prefer the definition of religion rife with theological connotations. I think atheists should engage in religious debate with influential theism promoting individuals but cannot do so in as meaningful of a way without first coming to terms on what ""practicing religion"" means. I think us atheists ought to stop denying that we practice religion. We are subject to the same sort of folly that anyone else is including theists. We may misplace trust as well. But that is not the definition of religion that an atheist is going by when they claim to not be religious. Agreed. Shouldn't atheists favor an atheistic definition of religion? Now, I don't know the percentage of people who claim to be atheist, but are really just agnostic As if people cannot be both but that lack of understanding in whatever percent in no way negates the first paragraph's misrepresentation of both what religion is, and their lack of understanding the inter-workings of other people's minds. nonsense alert I think the idea of a god is silly. Then theists won't take you seriously in discussions...which is fine if you don't aim to be influential But I don't presume to know what other people are thinking. my you do seem offended!! I'm open to only what science says as far as life and death. I don't believe religions, prophets, or magic, I think those things are superstition, nothing more, like breaking a mirror or a black cat. And theists, (much like you) are open to only the authorities they deem worthy. Being opposed to superstition I get and support. What I try to do is find what is honorable from various traditions (I don't absolutely exclude any) and honor it/them. It is also important for me to be critical of aspects of traditions that stand out to me as objectionable. As far as morals, I prescribe to philosophy, not any religious text. So if you understood religion the same way I do. Philosophical considerations including texts (valued by you) would strongly influence your morals. I think that religious morality is based again, on superstition, and like superstition, some is good you should replace ""religious"" in the above snipplet with ""theistic"" (just my opinion take it easy) What superstition is good? , some is bad, and it is rarely based on thought. Philosophy on the other hand is all thought, and unlike religion, philosophy can change its mind based on evidence. I identify theism as making religion less adaptable. Now, does that not sound like an atheist? Sure but not necessarily someone opposed to all forms of theism Where is the god I worship? I detect an integral element of theistic worship in the following: I'm open to only what science says and your concept of sound science is infallible? You have more in common with ""religious"" people than you think - methinks What ""answers"" am I appealing to a higher power for? If you believe that two heads are better than one then you have access to a ""higher power"" that has nothing to do with theism. Yet, according to the author of the first paragraph, I'm a liar or don't understand religion. I am convinced it is the latter the author of that quote is them self a bit confused by the entire thing. not as confused as y....LOL Maybe they are still struggling with some indoctrination who isn't? maybe they're one of those undercover theists trying to ""just get atheists to ask the question.""  could you please explain that? Whatever the the situation, it is clear they have spent little time considering the concept that other people do not necessarily think of things in the same light as they do. As evidenced by the first sentence after the debate hook line ""I am atheist and find that I differ with most other atheists on this subject"" I find the assumption that I, an atheist, have not already asked these questions thoroughly of myself before deciding on my own personal philosophy, a bit insulting. Is your personal philosophy decided? Have you made up your mind like worshipers do or are you open to change your mind based on evidence? Boo hoo. I am just having fun contrasting my opinion with yours. don't take it too personal. I was trying to be provocative enough for a thoughtful response. I think I got it. If you felt insulted you could always try to insult me back...lol Why on earth would one pretend to be an atheist? I would rather ask who might claim atheism but still be quite theistic without even recognizing it? Most atheists (just my opinion) This is too fun."	"No offense taken, or intended, I'm not here to find people I agree on everything with :)  I want to go through each point, I'll number the points highlighted in your reply in order: 1. Okay, so then I'm still not sure which definition of religion you are referring to. It seems you mean that a person who may put trust in another, in this case science, is not much different than a religious person's trust in say a Rabbi. Like perhaps I put faith in Hawkings' ideas. I don't want to make that assumption yet. I would say of that, that I only have as much faith as scientific method has proved, and am flexible more so than a religious person would be, when shown different proof. But I'm curious what you mean by this, could you define what you mean by ""practicing religions"" and how that mirrors an atheist? 2. This may be the same as 1. but what then would an atheistic definition of religion be? 3. An agnostic believes proof of a deity is impossible, or does not exist, either way they are not committed to the idea that there simply is not a god. An atheist is committed to the idea that there are no deities, so one cannot be both. If an atheist says ""I don't think there is a god, but there could be"" then they're actually agnostic. 4. I don't think this is nonsense at all. First of all, in spite of this debate, I still have no idea what you really think. In the same sense, no one can know what anyone else thinks. It may very well be that you do not differ as much from other atheists as you think. That is the point. No one can know what anyone believes really. 5. Point taken 6. Same as 4 7. But the difference is proof. Science has theories, and then the theories are either proved or not. There is no attempt to prove anything in religion. I think that would make the belief systems very dissimilar. With science, if a theory is proved wrong, then people walk away from that theory.  That theory was leading people in the wrong direction. How is a religious person ever to know if their theory is leading them in the wrong direction? The difference is, a theist doesn't ask. When they do, they usually end up agnostic or atheist. 8 and 9. Okay. 10. I'm curious how you separate theism from religion. Are you saying one can be religious without being a theist? It seems to be coming back to this point but from different directions, I think this may be the center of our debate.  Okay, I'm going to have to abandon the number system here: """"Now, does that not sound like an atheist? Sure but not necessarily someone opposed to all forms of theism Where is the god I worship? I detect an integral element of theistic worship in the following: I'm open to only what science says and your concept of sound science is infallible?

I am convinced it is the latter the author of that quote is them self a bit confused by the entire thing. not as confused as y....LOL Maybe they are still struggling with some indoctrination who isn't?"""" Basically this entire exchange stems from a misunderstanding of each other's positions, and serves little to further this debate, so let me paraphrase what is in my mind during this and hopefully it can be pointed toward a more beneficial direction: It's my belief whether correct or not, that a theist puts their faith in something that has no proof. This may be compared to some degree to a scientific theory in that proof is still missing. The difference I think though is in the pursuit of that proof. You are correct that I am willing to put my faith in a theory that seems to make sense, and in the same way, a god could make sense to another. But if a theory is put forth tomorrow that there was no big bang, but a new mathematic proof supports a constant state that simply expands and detracts the Universe in some way over time; okay then perhaps my ""faith"" will change. I would not continue to believe in a Big Bang in spite of mounting scientific proof. A theist has no tool to pursue the truth in any manner like this though. A theist isn't looking for proof, I believe they are looking for a nice story.  Maybe that is harsh. But while I can see how at face value belief in a theory can look a lot like a belief in a religion, the underlying method for coming about this I think makes them very different. """"maybe they're one of those undercover theists trying to ""just get atheists to ask the question.""  could you please explain that?"""" It is one of the New Born text book tactics. They have a bunch of them, not too important for this debate though. """"Whatever the the situation, it is clear they have spent little time considering the concept that other people do not necessarily think of things in the same light as they do. As evidenced by the first sentence after the debate hook line ""I am atheist and find that I differ with most other atheists on this subject"""""" Point taken. The reply isn't directly related to my point, as the point wasn't for the subject in general, but the lack of evidence of what others really believe. But it's a dead end anyway, so there's no point in pursuing it. """"I find the assumption that I, an atheist, have not already asked these questions thoroughly of myself before deciding on my own personal philosophy, a bit insulting. Is your personal philosophy decided? Have you made up your mind like worshipers do or are you open to change your mind based on evidence?"""" I am more than open to changing my mind based on evidence. I do not believe a theist is, this is where the problem lies I believe. This should not be taken that I am open to theism, as the proof is in on that subject I believe, which would separate myself from an agnostic. I think that is the proper definition of atheist, and I think that is the majority view of atheists. I'm not 100% sure how you believe an atheist should approach the entire thing other than this, and still call them self an atheist."	0
Well, duh... but who is more corrupt?	I personally feel that they are both equally corrupt. My problem with Dems: overtaxation, overreach of Constitutionally granted authority, over regulation, freedom of belief violations such as punishing people of faith, progressive taxation is a joke, globalism, indefinate detention without legal recource or just cause, wiretapping without warrants or just cause, police brutality, violations of the right of mentally stable people to bear arms, targeting libertarians, conservatives, and Christians, failure to use Constitutionally required procedure to declare and go to war, giving the president too much power, fraud, criminal activity, the Patriot Act, NDAA, and other similar acts, censorship, and so on. My problem with repubs; overreach of constitutionally granted authority, policing the world, dictating nonharmful private sex and marriage life, antichoice legislation, antiarab bigotry, antimuslim bigotry, indefinate detention without legal recourse of just cause, wire tapping without just cause, police brutality, targeting libertarians and Muslims, failure to use Constitutionally require procedure in declaring and going to war, giving the president too much power, fraud, criminal activity, the Oatriot Act, NDAA, and other similar acts, censorship, and so on.

"Which is why totalitarian states will so heavily indoctrinate in order to keep everyone on the same page. If a communist is putting forth a capitalistic stance, then he is being antagonistic to communism. Being a polygamist in a state that values relationships is not being diverse from that value, so it's not relevant to this debate. Interesting that you added ""/tested"" to this question. You did it so you could sneak in ""challenged"", which is not necessary for proving if an idea could work, with ""tested"" since that is the method for proving an idea could work. A good idea unchallenged is still a good idea."	"If a communist is putting forth a ""capitalistic stance"" he may very well be consistent with the writings of Marx, in the communist manifesto Marx mentioned how the communists and the democrats of his age should be aligned under certain circumstances.  Being polygamist, monogamist, serial-monogamist, polyandrous, etc in a state that values relationships is the state not having values antagonistic to a range of diversity. Thus state values are not necessarily antagonistic to diversity, and in this case that means diversity is not necessarily antagonistic to a state's values. meaning the state is not causing much inner strife or civil unrest which would make a community weaker. Thus diversity does not necessarily weaken communities in that regard.  I added /tested because tested and challenged are synonyms and I wanted to make the meaning Clear. If a idea goes unchallenged, it goes untested."	0

not exactly, it's sort of like the idea of the hamster on the wheel. the wheel only moves with the hamster on it, and as the wheel turns, the hamster keeps on going. and that can produce electricity as well... you just need to find a way to make the gears work that way.	Sorry - you've got me confused. Are you thinking of a pumped storage scheme? That's what Cruachan in Scotland is. Ignoring the refilling of the source by nature (i.e. rain!) for each 100MW generated it uses 118MW to pump the water back up to the top level. Obviously rain will offset that a bit, but not a huge amount. Pumped storage schemes are ideal for covering peaks in demand as they use excess generated power during troughs to pump the water back up. That's mainly a financial issue though; the differential in the cost of each unit of electricity between periods of peak demand and minimal demand is such that it can cost less to pump the water back up (using power bought from another station) that the pumped storage scheme charged for the electricity it generated.	0
"Yes, people should believe in God. The Bible says that, God is not pleased with that, that do not believe Him. The book of Psalms says ""Wicked says in his heart, there is no God."" Those who do not believe in God my question to them would be - ""If there is no God, tell me where the Universe come?"" If you say - there was a power and it created the Universe. The my question would be - ""Where the power came from?"" So, no doubt there is God and as a human being, we must believe in God for the following reasons.  (1) If not believe, it displeases God. (2) When we believe, then we get piece in our mind (3) Believing God causes man to separate him/her from evil ways (4) There comes unity, as people get together and worship a God."	double post much ?	0

If you say you don't have a religion, you don't. It is magic to reject, that this world was made by some kind of miracle. I mean think about it - if .. protein wasn't made under big bang - no life in the universe could ever be. If water somehow wasn't made - no life on earth or anywhere else in the universe would be. I could go on .. if we never had oxygen, an atmosphere, clouds, a sun or if we remove all the natural disasters like volcano's breaking out, tsunamis and earth quakes ... if remove ALL of those happened through time before human was created - Humans probably never would have been made. No tell me - how is it NOT a miracle, that miraculously - everything just fits into our needs?	Everything doesn't fit our needs - we changed to adapt to what was available in our environment.  I agree that the Earth being able to sustain life is an extraordinary coincidence, but when you consider that our planet is just one of many planets in our solar system which is just one of many solar systems in our galaxy which is just one of many galaxies in our universe which is just one of many universes in existence, the chances of life such as ours existing for a while on a planet like ours increases dramatically.	0

An arm bar does not necessarily have to injure your opponent when first applied it should be uncomfortable not injurous the level of comfort or injury all depends on the amount of pressure applied	"To the contrary, the arm-bar IS NOT a pain compliance technique like other holds. They usually DO NOT produce significant enough pain or discomfort for an opponent to signal their training partner to stop. Not only do students have to be carefully instructed that they should signal their opponent to stop well prior to feeling pain or discomfort, but those applying ""mock"" armbars in practice, need to be carefully instructed to release the hold before extending AT ALL to avoid injuries during practice. Further, if an armbar is to be utilized correctly, there should be no hesitation at any point in the movement to allow an opponent to surrender. In a non-training situation, once the move is begun, it's completion should result in an opponent having their elbow hyper-extended. Though there is another debate to be had about whether this move is advisable in a real world self-defense scenario, there is nothing gentle about real armbars, therefore armbars are not Jiu Jitsu"	0

"Capitalism and communism are compatible in theory, but incompatible in practice? That doesn't follow at all. Either your theory is wrong, or reality is wrong. So now you're saying an ideology that allows diversity within its own ideology is strong? Sure, I agree, but that's hardly proof of the strength of diversity since nothing is actually diverging from the state's values. That would be like saying a state that values monogamous relationships, but doesn't specify at which age persons should marry, is strengthened because it is diverse within it's own value.  ""Testing"" (challenged by another ideology) an ideology =/= testing an ideology on the market. That's really all that needs to be said about this. Testing an ideology against another ideology is only theoretical, it's not nearly as reliable of a means as actually testing an ideology on the market. Personally, I believe that a nation free of any state is stronger than any state-nation. Having said that, the states most consistent have historically been much more powerful. Germany was very totalitarian and it took on the world. The states with the most inner conflict have always been the ones with the most diversity, like racial tension. Could you imagine how weak a state would be if the public was split between valuing democracy and monarchism? It would collapse in no time."	There are different stages in communist theory dealing with different stages in reality. The stage of a classless stateless society will not have a capitalist economy, however the stages before that may find communists working against, within, or even for various forms of capitalism. So you agree then that when diversity is accepted it makes the community or state strong. It seems weakness comes more so when people try to squash diversity, rather then accept it.  Testing an idea against various theoretical models allows for better empirical tests. It allows you to know the important points of conflict to test for. When a theory is considered perfect and not tested against other theories then what points of the theory to test are not as clear. If a theory considered as perfect and is unchallenged by other ideas is to be tested empirically then those tests are going to be of a lesser quality, potentially not even testing for what could be a major flaw.  Germany was strong, however wouldn't they of been stronger if they would of recruited more of the people they persecuted into their army or military complex somehow? For example they could of had the atomic bomb if Einstein wasn't threatened by them.    The Romans allowed local laws to stay in place when they conquered a people, not much changed but the army of the area. The USA has been the only superpower for awhile.	0

"No, atheism is the antithesis of theism and incongruent with religion.  The rant image attached to this debate is also a reactionary and inaccurate representation of atheism. For instance, it is not ""ironic"" or ""self-defeating"" to use reason (def: logic) to argue that there is no reason (def: universal or god-driven purpose) for life.  As far as morality goes, religion is certainly no better and quite arguably worse in its absolute arbitrariness. An atheistic approach actually considers reasons for certain practices and their implications upon the well-being of others. Sure, they are still constructed by humans but I would choose an intentional moral construct over an arbitrary one any day. I also do not judge others for having different morals or views; I judge people for clinging to morals or views which are antiquated and contradicted by known facts. I do not think that I am right about everything, but I do think that my process of arriving at my thoughts and beliefs is objectively preferable to the theistic approach."	I agree with you on atheism being the exact opposite of theism. As fro the picture, it was a stereotypical view on the subject, to try to keep things mellow. I did the same with the picture representing this debate.	0

"It all comes down to eating a balanced diet that gives you the nutrients you need. If you can't get those nutrients through typical foods, then you supplement them. Just because some vegans aren't eating properly, doesn't mean a vegan diet is unhealthy, it just means those vegans weren't eating properly. The same goes for omnivores; If they don't eat a proper diet, they are going to be deficient in things as well. To fix the lack of B12, all a vegan needs to do is take a multi-vitamin or eat foods that have been supplemented with B12 (many foods are, especially vegan ones).  Vegetarians and vegans have lower muscle creatine and carnosine levels. Again, it's all about eating a balanced diet and supplementing anything that you're not getting enough of. The article about lower muscle creatine even said, ""Well-planned, appropriately supplemented vegetarian diets appear to effectively support athletic performance"" It also said, ""plant and animal protein sources appear to provide equivalent support to athletic training and performance."" Grass-fed meat is higher in omega-3’s, CLA, TVA, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and antioxidants. Those articles were comparing grass-fed meat to grain-fed meat. They said nothing at all about a vegan diet.  Saturated fat is not associated with cardiovascular disease. Did someone say it is? My guess is that you are referring to that quote I posted on the ""yes"" side of the debate, and that you mistakenly connected the statement in the first sentence of the quote with the second sentence. I can see how that could be easily confused. It's not saying that saturated fat causes heart disease, it's just saying that vegan diets are low in saturated fat, and also result in less risk of heart disease, but not necessarily because of the low saturated fat."	Yes, it Comes down to having a balanced diet. A diet that is tipping the scales with vegetarian only meals that leave you with deficiencies, Is not what I would call a balanced diet. If you need to take an artificial supplement in order to not have a deficiency, that is not a balanced diet. What do you think people were expected to do before that supplement existed? Humans lived on the Paleo diet, which included animal saturated fat, and vegetables. A balanced diet is not just a vegetarian diet because it is not healthy for you, nor natural. You need saturated fats from animal fats for an optimal diet. Especially omega 3's. MCT oil is fantastic for this, you can convert this to energy with little to no digestive process. I pointed out how a pure vegan diet isn't healthy for kids. You have to supplement it just for it to work. In other words your have to pretend you are on a different diet.  Can you do this? I guess, but why would you when you can do it in a more healthy and natural way. I care for the treatment. I only eat grass fed animal, open range vegetarian chicken and farmed eggs. Grass fed butter and MCT oil and I eat alot of organic kale salads.  You should really check out the Bulletproof diet. I teach Jiu-Jitsu and depend on health and stamina. I have to cut weight and can tell the difference between what diets work and don't work and what allows you to loose weight and retain or even improve energy. But everybody is different, if it works for you, go for it.=) I tried pure vegan diets, and I lost weight, yeah, but my cardio was horrible, I felt lethargic and couldn't handle intense workouts without a supplement... That told me my body needed something more that a pure vegan diet was providing. It was unnatural for my body to just eat that.	0
"Well, that's actually not how the argument from evil goes - or at least, it's not how someone who is serious about the argument would state it. The argument doesn't run: ""If God exists, then he is omnibenevolent."" Rather, omnibenevolence is one of the characteristics that are inherent in the definition of God as used in this argument. The most basic form of this argument runs: ""If God exists and is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent, then there will be no evil. There is evil, therefore there is no God who is omni-all-of-the-above."" The argument from evil is only a workable argument against a God who is conceived as being omnibenevolent. Of course, due to the limitations of human knowledge, we cannot know whether or not God (if he exists) is omnibenevolent or not, but for the purposes of argument we assume that we can know some things about God. For the purpsoses of every argument we have to assume that we can know some things about the topic of argument, or we will never be able to say anything."	"As stated, while you can use evil as an example as to why MAYBE God is not omni-all-that-shit, it is not ""a coherent argument against the existence of God(s)""."	0

I provide proof, and you reject it. People in America claim they don't want kids. Those same people don't use protection. It all fits No it does not fit you failed to include the one child policy in your equation :/ You know you have no proof of that, plus it goes against your statement that it was because they don't want to harm children. No it doesn't go against the statement it's just including it within the other possibilities :l You said it works very well. Yes I did, but that does not mean that the idea is 100% successful. You are only assuming that's what i meant. :l I saw you do this stupid proof thing before and I called you out on it. So, I went back and found where you did it before. I could have sworn it was more than once. But, I guess not. I just wanted to point out that your asking for proof reaction was stupid, and you proved me right.  Stupid proof thing? What is so wrong with asking for proof?	"No it does not fit you failed to include the one child policy in your equation :/ You provide a claim. I say your claim may be false, and provide a very good reason. You say ""No!"". So, I will continue to disagree with you. I would argue that what people personally want would be a much stronger motivator than what the law says, so my example is strengthened by not bringing in the one child policy into the equation. No it doesn't go against the statement it's just including it within the other possibilities :l If you keep naming different reasons, don't they start to not have any bearing on the situation? Yes I did, but that does not mean that the idea is 100% successful. You are only assuming that's what i meant. :l Wait, what? We are talking about it being successful at all, not 100%. You claimed you never said women wouldn't have children. You didn't claim that all women wouldn't have children. Stupid proof thing? What is so wrong with asking for proof? Good question, why did you get so upset with me when I asked you? If someone gives a belief it is kind of stupid to ask for proof. If you ask for evidence or reasoning it isn't so bad. But, you use the word proof for situations that can't be proved. I overreacted though. I thought it was something you had been doing over and over again. A couple months ago someone asked me for proof when the debate topic was what do you think ... So, now I am extra pissed off when people ask for proof."	0
"Take all the fun out of it? How? You're the same person! If you like it and see it so much, you think you'd have been desensitized to it before. So you enjoy the porn due to the excitement? If all it becomes in the future is... penetration, then so what? Who cares? It is a natural act, but I'm getting off course, here. This is about nudity and swearing, not sex. I understand why the bad words are so powerful, but, I mean, if we go by your system, how long is this going to take? These words have been around for ages, but people will still get mad at you and it still has that ""bad factor"" that they had back years and years ago."	"words like crap and piss used to be bad though. but now they're not... why? cause we're used to them. They aren't even censored on TV because we just decide ""shit is much worse than crap"". We set a standard in order to create power. Otherwise, I'll just say Nigger every time I was angry. I know people will know I mean business when I'm saying ""Kyke raping Nigger Fag!!"". as for nudity. as i've said, the only difference there will be between nudity and porn is the penetration.  think about it. There was a time where legs and ankles were considered sexy. who the fuck still thinks ankles are sexy now a days? allowing nudity on prime time will just make tits and ass less sexy. That's why there are so many fucked up fetishes now a days. Because porn is so legit and mainstream that we need new things to get off on."	0
Batman and Iron Man... Well, they are both rich as hell... Batman acts all high class, whereas Iron Man has obvious flaws in character, and seems sleazy, which is cool because every man in his position would be the same way... if they didn't love themselves too much, like batman does.... Fuck vanity, fuck batman, it's all about the iron.	Although sleazy does match the profile of any politician, Batman definitely has a better education and upbringing. Iron man is too haphazard and would probably end up passing some giant tax loopholes for his corporate buddies. Batman on the other hand would protect the weak and support and more Democratic party system.	0
"Evolution was never meant to explain the origin of life. It seeks to explain the diversity within life. Life has to already exist for evolution to happen. The word you are looking for is abiogenesis. Meanwhile to the distinguished, misquoted and/or horribly behind-the-times thinkers: Dr. Verner- Ther IS NO INFORMATION IN MATTER. The so-called ""information"" in genetic code is just chemistry. We impose the information so we can make sense of it. Leslie Orgel- No one is arguing they organized spontaneously. However, there is CONSIDERABLE evidence that a small sequence can grow slightly longer in a wide range of environments. Over GREAT periods of time they coded to be longer and longer. Not an ounce of spontaneity here. Dr. Hoyle- Get back to me when you have isolated ""life""...take your time, I'm patient.  Chandra Wickramasinghe- The odds get a whole heck of a lot better when you realize that we aren't calculating life spontaneously emerging out of nowhere. The set of characteristics WE have assigned to life become increasingly probably when you start from the protobiont, which already has most of the characteristics and is composed of numerous cause-and-effect pairings that are highly probably in an environment such as early earth.  Brooks J.- And yet you admit there is evidence of this event. Sounds like to you need to rerun your numbers.  Hubert P. Yockey- Totally true. We do not yet know how life started, which is why people are still investigating. Thankfully, this had nothing to do with evolution. If evolution is true, it will be true regardless of how life originated.  Brooks J. (2)- The question has yet to be answered. In the meantime, we go with evidence, not your highly spurious estimation of the odds. Do you know what a scientist is? I won't respond to Dr. Crick because the author quoted-mined him really badly. The author does not realize what Dr. Crick was saying.  Oh hey, yeah Hogan can stand too. He knows the difference between evolution and abiogenesis, even though the person who posted this does not.  Ernst Chain- You apparently haven't visited a good laboratory lately, have you? Brooks J- This is now known to be almost certainly untrue. There is strong evidence now that there were likely multiple life origins. There could have been very many, but most were lost to history. truth, most evolutionary research has tended to shy away from the origin of life issue, perhaps because most experts don't really know where to start in their speculation. No. It is because evolutionary research is NOT ABOUT the origin of all life on the planet. Just the diversity of it. And there is actually A LOT of research into abiogenesis."	I appreciate and respect your comprehensive responses. I still feel you discount the factual reality that DNA is extremely, incredibly complex and WOULD NEVER HAVE FORMED naturally, randomly, or by chance alone in some warm pool of water somewhere. The odds are far too high and have been calculated by more than one researcher. Non-organic matter cannot suddenly become organized or even a little bit better organized.

This is also why the titles ""Prosecution"" and ""Defendant"" are applied, the prosecution is pointing the finger at somebody, providing a claim, placing guilt. The defendant, is the one who defends against the claim. The same goes for a civil case, where you have ""plaintiff"" and ""defendant"". The plaintiff is literally ""claimant"", the one who initiates the case. We measure the claim of something, not the rejection."	0

"You can certainly take the stance that the limited human mind cannot possibly comprehend the mind of an unlimited being. It's a very rational stance. But this if we're to have any serious discussions about God at all, we'll need to hide this idea in one corner of our minds, and just reason about God as best we can. I'll make an example. Take the theory of skepticism, which states that we know nothing about this world for certain. You might think you know what you look like, where you live, etc, but there's a possibility that you could be deluded. This is a pretty rational stance to take. But does this mean that it's pointless for us to attempt to gain knowledge? Should we just close down all our schools and universities, because everything that is being taught and discovered may well be false? Should we stop making any kind of decisions, because decisions are based upon beliefs, and any or all of these beliefs we hold may be false? No. While we should keep a healthy dose of skepticism in our minds, in everyday life we need to act as if we can know what is real and what is not, or else society simply won't be able to function. The same applies to religious considerations, where the ""we can't know anything about God"" is something like a localised version of the skepticism argument. Sure, it's good to have that thought somewhere in your mind; it keeps you humble and open-minded. But for practical purposes, when you're debating whether or not God exists, or just discussing or expounding the tenets of any religion that includes belief in an unlimited God, you need to act as if you can attempt to find out at least some things about God. Otherwise, the philosophers and scientists will have nothing to say about God except ""we don't know"", the Pope, priests, and pastors will have nothing to say except ""we don't know"", and the Bible will be replaced by a single line saying: ""Your puny mind can't truly know anything about God or what he wants you to do, so there's no point trying to find out. Just sit back and hope that you go to heaven. Good luck."""	"To me, it would be a good thing if religions admitted that they have no idea on what God is thinking. That is not the case, however. In pure logic, the assumption that God exists would be followed by the fact that ""if God exists, we have no idea on what he's thinking"".  The religious make their own rules, and if we're debating religion itself it would apply more to the tactics of God. But to say ""God doesn't exist because evil things happen"" or ""Even if God does exist, he doesn't care about us because evil things happen"" is like saying ""I know what God's intentions would be if he existed"". It's intellectually dishonest. There are more logical reasons for not believing in God. Because bad things happen to good people is not one of them."	0
If you have the ability to save the five teens and you do not, then you've indirectly were the cause of their death.	MasterKage, did you completely ignore my argument?  Quantity doesn't matter, it's the quality that matters. If those teenagers were being idiots playing on a train track then they deserved a punishment that came their way. They would have received enough warning: all over the news, in schools, and several other places they would have been warned against playing games such as 'chicken' on the train tracks. If they choose to ignore the advice that has been supplied to them it is the equivalent of them ignoring their chance of life.  Whereas the fat man has done nothing wrong. If you kill someone intentionally who has done nothing wrong then you will be sentenced to prison - probably for the rest of your life. This has, in effect, killed you (you will not be a free person anymore). So, unless you want to have the guilt of murder on your hands and be sentenced to stay behind bars for years on end, until you die, then you should probably just not become involved.  If you are not involved then you haven't killed anyone. Indirectly? Well, you had nothing to do with it so how can you be given the blame?	0
"I accept this debate and shall take the position that we should not ban mixed-race marriages nor prohibit them from reproducing. I'll begin this round by replying to my opponent's opening. ""Mostly caucasian males with asian whores."" This is a baseless assertion against Asian women. You also need to provide data that the majority of mixed race marriages are of this sort for it to have some relevance. ""'Oh, what a traitor of their country.' was what I thought. Those men, leaving their country's women and not making child of true heritage."" Why are they traitors? And what value is there to having ""true heritage""? ""And the men of the women's country, they wouldn't have any woman! Their children wouldn't even have proper nationality and home!"" This assertion isn't backed with anything. ""Those asian women only rely on Caucasian men for money, and thus, the children is what I hate the most, arrogant pricks. The woman is a whore, dressing like a prostitute."" Once again this is a baseless assertion requiring some evidence. It also needs to be given context related to the resolution. ""Believe me, I've got a lot of experience dealing with these mongrels."" My opponent's possible prejudice aside, what he has ""dealt with"" has nothing to do with properly substantiating the resolution. ""This belief shall be established not only in my country but globally."" We'll need to hear at least one good reason and some evidence backing it up to consider the resolution. Especially if it's to be considered on a global level. ""I do not believe in racism, and I think that races a're all equal and have unique cultures, but what I dislike is the fact that cultures and races are merging into one another, making them lose their uniqueness."" What is wrong with races and cultures merging? And what value is there in the uniqueness of cultures? While there may be a good answer to this, please relate it to the resolution. To what extent and for what reason is the ""uniqueness of culture"" so valuable that we should prevent all mixed-race marriages? ""We shall globally make the affirmation ""We shall fight as one united being with our country!"""" I'm not sure what this means and how it applies to the resolution. So far my opponent hasn't stated anything to support the resolution. I look forward to seeing my opponent make an argument in favor of banning mixed-race marriages and to him replying to my responses. I'd like to thank my opponent for this debate and anyone who reads it."	Pro You may have pointed out some of the flaws I had made, but it seems that you do not have a strong conviction to support mixed races, you are just someone with a neutral will. I do not see any benefits being made from mixed races. No matter which races are merged in, they are inferior due to the fact they lack loyalty in their country. These men are from First-world countries, therefore they go overseas to work. If these men have opportunities to work overseas, that means that they are both rich and on a prominent position. Do you want these good men to make children with women that does not have value in position or occupation? The child is not going to belong in the fatherland that has provided all for him/her. Populations of first-world countries are decreasing due to the fact that men go overseas without making children with his own people. Everybody loves these children just because of how they were born. They are likely to escape unemployment, because many people are wanting to hire them for their education, talent, and so on. This makes the people born in unfortunate circumstances hard to find jobs. Thus the children of these people are in such fortunate state that they can evade military service and poverty. Think of all the soldiers that fought for their country. Do these children have the same loyalty as they do? Report this Argument	0

All this is equally a conjecture. No, it is not. Prove for me that alien life exists.

You God makes imperfect beings and judges them on a perfectionist law, with standards impossible to meet by those he imposes upon. God made us without sin in the garden of eden. We messed up, not God. We have sin because we sin, not God. It simply is the way it is. However, this is what Jesus taught! Look at the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus says all over that Sermon that people must be perfect, as their Heavenly Father is perfect, and greater than the scribes and the Pharisees. But right before this He gives us the beatitudes, and then states that He came to fulfill the Law and Prophets. We must be perfect, yes, I will agree to that. But the grace of the gospel is not that we can do anything, but that God can; He was perfect for us, and took our place, our sin, so that we may take upon ourselves His righteousness. We must be perfect, but we can't do it. Christ did it for us! Praise be to God! All we have to do is simply have faith that Jesus will transpose this righteousness to us, which He promises to do! God made a way out, and He promised it immediately after the fall of man, in Genesis 3 (the curse of the serpent). He knew that we wouldn't be able to fulfill the law. So He made a way out!  Let me ask you one thing, do you believe all non-Christians will go to hell? I do. And it is a terrible shame.	0
"It is not the Christians that take the Bible literally, but the atheists. Atheists continually site Bible verses as if they are fact, Christians know better. Who is close-minded and one-track-minded as well, not the Christians.  God hasn't spoken directly to man since the time of Jesus, that I'm aware of. How is it that one can say ""God said so""? If you're referring to the Bible, i was written by man, not God. Man has only told man to do things. God didn't write the Bible. Get the facts straight."	Most Atheists probably haven't even opened a bible, myself included. It most definitely is the Christians that take it so seriously, because it sure as hell isn't us. And we are not close-minded. I think you are mistaking that for being logical, which we are. There is nothing wrong with your belief aside from that very fact. It is merely a 'belief'.	0
Firstly abortion has to do with an unborn life, innocent of all crimes, mistakes or guilt. The fetus as we all know is referred to as a growing human being which can also be referred to as a human organism. The term organism refers to life so the terms combined would mean human life. The Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.  The death penalty refers to the punishment decreed by the constitution equivalent to the crime committed and is part of the law. What puzzles me is many who oppose the death penalty supports abortion when they claim that they are so concerned about human life. If they are so concerned about human life then why would they support the taking of the life of the unborn? This in my opinion is hypocrisy. Practice what you speak not the opposite.  Why fight for the life of a criminal who has and may continue to kill and never regret it when at the same time you are supporting for innocent young lives to be killed in horrific methods of abortion when you claim the death penalty is horrific itself.	Capital punishment as it exists today is a laughably ineffective system. Were it possible to reliably convict and kill off criminals in a monetarily reasonable manner, I would be all for capital punishment. Unfortunately, as it stands CP is a horribly flawed system and wastes millions of dollars in taxpayer money - even more than the equally bloated prison system. So while I might support CP in theory, in practice it simply isn't feasible within today's court system. Abortion, on the other hand, suffers from none of these drawbacks unless you consider it a moral dilemma. Which I don't. (it's all about the benjamins baby)	0
People need to realize that if they aren't Christians then they will go to hell.  We Christians just care about you! We don't want to know that when you die, you are going to suffer for all eternity.

Since there is no need to give further support of the practical application of the concept in making the world a safer place, I will go ahead and talk about the application on a deeper emotional level. I think the way we are judging is wrong. An eye for eye may seem barbaric, but a justice system based on presentability and propriety merely makes us appear more civilized rather than helping human beings with real feelings. Justice should then be based on inherent correctness. If we study the universe and physics, an eye for an eye is a perfectly sound and objective course of events. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction and energy can neither be created or destroyed. If a person is raped, tortured and murdered and the same fate is not reflect back upon the victimizer, the victim's pain does not dissappear but very much lingers in an unbalanced equation, creating unaidable mental, spiritual and physical breakdown. Such pain cannot simply be swept underneath the carpet of political correctness and according to the laws of the universe, will manifest itself in later generations. The carpet will eventually become a mountain. Basically what I'm saying is, energy cannot be destroyed, a victim without justice is indeed creating stress in society that will eventually snap. The idea of revenge is a natural response and what goes around comes around follows a very real universal law. Any opponent of an eye for an eye resolution should try telling an atom not to explode back when hit by a zooming electron.	You speak of seeking equilibrium. When one tragedy occurs due to someone's criminal act, how does creating another tragedy by exacting equal revenge restore the situation to its previous harmony? In thinking of punishment as revenge and allowing people to exact equal revenge for crime, you're encouraging them to harbour bitterness for their misfortunes and anger against fellow human beings. You're fueling hatred with more hatred, sorrow with more sorrow, cruelty with more cruelty. Would creating people whose emotions and morality revolve around anger, and whose actions revolve around revenge, really make the world a better place?	0

Cod and Halo are geared towards anyone over 18. Video games in general have no target audience. Anyone can play. MLP is targeted SPECIFICALLY at girls ages 1-10ish. If not that then just females in general. When a grown fucking man watches something like that, how can you not call homo? I'm all for women's equality. Play video games, drive monster trucks, own companies, play football, whatever. But grown ass males should NOT be watching My Little Pony. And at the very damn least, not watch it and then wonder why everyone is calling you a faggot. I'm not homophobic. I just personally see this as a stupid, childish, and in some cases disturbing act that needs to, at the very least, stop being praised.	So your all for Womens equality but not the other way around, theres a possibility that these guys just want to watch something innocent and fun, maybe they remember watching it as a kid and just want to get away from the stresses of modern life and remember that more innocent time of being a kid again. Yes the program is aimed at little girls but the program makers made it so that it could be accesible to the whole family girls, boys and their parents	0

Yes, because in the back of their rational minds they know that they must accept the possibility of a God, but they simply refuse to.	Your premise is of course fallible, but more to the point I contend that one can acknowledge an improbable possibility whilst still not believing in it.

You know that great depression we just went through, that ended in companies receiving a blank check from the government (at our expense) to correct their affairs?  Great Depression? Wow, you are drinking Obama's kool aid. Buzzed, wrong, try again. Since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. So if companies fail as did GM, they fail and not bail them out. Federal Government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's. <a href='http://www.propublica.org/special/government-bailouts'>Bailout	Great Depression? Wow, you are drinking Obama's kool aid. Not really, it's an obvious fact to anyone not invested in corporate freedom. Since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. So if companies fail as did GM, they fail and not bail them out. I agree, let bad companies fail. Oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. I guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? Federal Government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's.

Nah, I disagree... I've traveled quite a bit in the world and everywhere I went the intelligent people think more like me than you... but I don't doubt that the ignorant, sick bastards think more like you, that would only make sense.	Yes those ignorant sick bastards, your not biased at. Like the vietnamese, they dont like Ameircans i can assure, ive been twice, once when i was 10 and just last summer. Hey but there all ignorant sick bastards, aren't, never mind the fact that you enough bombs on that small beautiful country to equal 700 Hiroshimas (look it up), never mind that the fact that you killed between 3-4 million of them and vaporised entired villages with napalm, spread agent orange (a deadly chemical weapon, you know like the kind Saddam used). The effects of that confcit are still being felt and will be fopr a long time to come, but hey there ignorrant sick bastyards casue they didnt get behind the red, white and blue.

Yes, it should be the responsibility of the individual to attend school. If they fail because they don't go to lessons, it's their fault.	Although it should be their responsibility it doesn't mean that they have the maturity level to make the responsible decision. If it were aloud so simply to skip whatever class you want, no assuming they'd skip all classes, they could gain the mindset that they can always do whatever they want, and don't have to do what they don't want. It's like the rule on wearing seat belts. Not only are we saving you from yourself, and penalizing you as extra incentive to be saved, but we are saving anyone under you care. If you're a father and you don't wear your seat belt and die in a crash, the victim is not you it's your child. In the scenario the man didn't have the knowledge or desire to wear his seat belt and he payed the ultimate price for the lack of knowledge. In the case with the kids who freely skip classes with no fear of punishment they are being left to hinder themselves in the future. I wrote so much because I jump around a lot, sorry.	0

George Bush was not a dictator, the mere belief of that shows a lack of understanding.	Is there no trickle up theory of death? George Bush started an illegal invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. During his presidency almost 100,000 civilians were killed. In 2007 alone, 24,000 civilians were killed and only 19,000 insurgents. Because he started these wars, and he ordered our soldiers to kill others, and our soldiers displayed a lack of respect towards innocent life, isn't it his fault that they weren't properly prepared for the responsibility he placed in their hands?	0

"How would you propose humans ""nicely and humanly 'kill'"" animals? What would you consider to be what an animals pain level is or not. How can you determine how an animal feels pain?"	If you have a brain and nerves then you feel pain - most animals have that, I don't know of any living creatures except insects that don't have nerves and brains, but you might know of one? Pain is usually measured with a pain scale, where a person says how intense his or hers pain is from 1-10 (if I'm not mistaken) - then you'll just have to take their word for it. This is possible to do, because people can talk - since people can't communicate with animals, this can not be done. But just because the animal can't talk doesn't mean they don't feel pain - if a mute man was shot in his leg, would you assume he had no pain just because he couldn't express it with words? The first sensory component of pain is nociception. It reveals damage impact and activates a reflex. Again, it is not a feeling but a reflex, therefore if you touch something hot, you immediately remove your finger, even though you feel no pain. This feature is found majority of different species. It is observed with some kind of image thing, I don't know very much about that. This proves that animal do feel pain. A nice and human kill can be made with painless murder. I do not want to kill animals myself, but if others want to do it, it is my wish that they would do it with some kind of respect. Painless killing can be done in a lot of ways, poison, and I recently heard that if you shoot someone in the right spot of the brain, they will immediately die without pain - I don't know if this is true though.	0

Time is a property of Universe, it was there before human same as gravity before Newton...	"Time is not a property of the universe. Time is basically an illusion, it does not really exist, if there weren't that which enable change there would be no such thing as ""time"". Structurally our universe is made of matter and energies which react and affect each other, which causes them to change their location, their consistency, etc. There's no ""time"" anywhere. Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed. I'd say time is change, of everything. But then why call it ""time""? Also then time would not apply to only our universe, as not only here happens change (assuming there's more than just this universe). Humans created time. Even though it is useful."	0
Yes it is. Wishing someone a Happy Holiday, and especially a Merry Christmas, can be offensive no matter how well intended.

Generally, the Spartans didn't really fight with the rest of them. Only untill it was a unified empire(?) did they, and even that I'm not 100% sure on.	I'm glad to see people making allowances like you are. Anyways The Spartans and the other tribes in the area of Sicily worked to oppose the Athenian Empire but only domestically. With one exception they in the union with Sparta against the Delium League joined forces against every major non Greek invader in their history. So your half right about them not fighting as one unit until they where concord. But they would fight as 2 separate forces to oppose non natives.	0

"You asked god (correct me if im wrong) to prove to you he existed correct? And then you read the bible. The bible is what ""proved"" to you he existed. So god didnt really do anything, you yourself did by reading the bible yourself. See what i mean? You sought out the answer to the prayer, god didnt really answer it.  A real answer and real PROOF of his existence would be if you had not done anything at all. Not read the bible or did internet research, nothing. If you just went about your daily life normally then BOOM god starts talking to you or you see him or something tangible that you didnt do yourself. See the difference?  Also, reading the bible does not prove god is real. Of course if you read the Koran it will say their god is real. Of course if you read a Wiccan spellbook it will say their god and goddess are real. Its just words on paper. It's meaningless and certainly not proof enough to believe that god exists and everything written about him in the rest of the bible is true."	"Its a shame I answered this late. It seems interesting. You asked god (correct me if im wrong) to prove to you he existed correct? And then you read the bible. The bible is what ""proved"" to you he existed. So god didnt really do anything, you yourself did by reading the bible yourself. See what i mean? You sought out the answer to the prayer, god didnt really answer it.  When many people read the Bible they overlook many important passages and they miss the message behind the words. I can honestly say thats why people in my class fail literature. There is a verse in the Bible that says  ""so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled: 'When they see what I do, they will learn nothing. When they hear what I say, they will not understand. Otherwise, they will turn to me and be forgiven.'"" Mark 4:12 Basically Jesus was working miracles and people were still doubting him. To me thats a little messed up and its a display of ignorance.

Sure, the story wasn't that good. But it wasn't meant to be as spectacular as Terminator or True Lies, but rather as an allegory.	"The allegory or ""symbolism"" behind the movie was not good either.

To be fair, despite the story being one of the most unoriginal things I have even seen it was not the worst told story.

Its going on at the moment the US can make a difference By helping now and the problem will be over. Obama is correct that when we can do something about it why don't we?	Look my friend, im not saying your sentiment is wrong, if anything i agree with it. The problem is that supporting a rebel group that is most liley split along ethnic lines is very dangerous. You should realise the only reason the US and Nato are supporting the rebels is because they are against Gaddafi. Now im not saying their bad but they may be just as capable of commiting atrocites as Gaddafi himslef if they take power. Remember Kosovo, the Us and Nato intervened once it had become apparent that Serbs were commiting ethnic cleansing against the Yugoslavian people, what you didnt hear about was the Yugoslavian milita that were subsequently backed (arms and funding) by Washington and her allies were just as guilty of commiting atrocites. What im saying is if the US and Nato contiue to help the rebels militarily they may find out later is wasn't such a humantarian move at all, but you see they dont care, they just want Gaddafi gone at this piont, hes proved to be a thron in their sides.	0
But the government didn't own his body. After a person in America dies, their family get's the remains if the person isn't a donor or sold to science.

If you were a parent and give a child an AK-47 and tell him to run free and do whatever he wants, and he shoots another child without realizing the implications who do you blame? Exactly, you would blame the parent who handed the kid a fully loaded AK and told him to run free. Was that event tragic, yes. Was it preventable, yes. But what do you have to say for the poor little bugger that got shot. You can call free will whatever you want, call it a curse, call it a gift, but whatever it is, according to you, god gave it to us. God still gave this child the ability to kill and allowed the actions of one person, to destroy the innocent life of another. My question is how can you reconcile the consequences of death for the innocent child with an all loving god. How could he allow that child to die in a situation that in no way reflected a free choice of his own. How does this child learn or grow from his experience with evil?	You didn't real the Bible at all did you? Adam and Eve were made without evil to begin with. Eve was tricked into having the knowledge of good and evil by the serpent, who is Satan.

I don't insult you, I just say as it is. If there is something wrong with a person then that person should exert some effort to correct him or herself. This applies to you. If you have no desire to correct yourself and all you want to do is spew nonsense then keep your crap to yourself. You are forcing your idiotic bullshit onto others by saying they will absolutely burn in hell that doesn't even exist, because their opinions differ - not respectful at all. you don't see me saying bad things about what you believe now do I? That's because I don't believe anything, for one. And also, what I say is not nonsense unless spewing nonsense was my intent all along, and it's not. Its true that those who don't want to believe in God for the rest of their lives will go to hell because that tells God they don't want to believe in me on this earth and thus you will be eternally separated from Him. Exactly what I was referring to - nonsense. And not just, but nonsense you think actually is real and as such you absolutely believe people who differ in mind will be tortured forever. Not only disrespectful but you are also a bad person.	Of course you say it as it is because when you start insulting someone you don't feel guilty for what you said because your indifferent.   If you have no desire to correct yourself and all you want to do is spew nonsense then keep your crap to yourself. I am sorry but I can't keep it to myself I am suppose to tell everyone about my beliefs and share it so that everyone will have an opportunity to hear about Jesus. And you can't stop me so I don't know why you continue to say thing like keep it to yourself and all that other stuff.   You are forcing your idiotic bullshit onto others by saying they will absolutely burn in hell that doesn't even exist, because their opinions differ - not respectful at all. I do correct myself and I don't need someone like you to correct me because you have your own problems and I have my own but I don't need correction from an atheist who hasn't been saved and has more problems then I do I am not forcing anything upon anyone its their decision if they want to hear about Christ or learn about Him. If they tell me they don't want to then I move on to the next person.  Like not being open to what I have to say and your close-minded and don't want to listen. I listen to your stuff even if it is crap that you spew or something I disagree with. And yet you don't take the time to listen what my beliefs had to say. It has to work both ways not just your way of things.  That's because I don't believe anything, for one. And also, what I say is not nonsense unless spewing nonsense was my intent all along, and it's not Yes you do believe in something its called athiesm a lack of belief in God. You also believe in secular humanism where man is the source of all cause which is flawed because we didn't create everything like for example this earth or the people in it.  Exactly what I was referring to - nonsense. And not just, but nonsense you think actually is real and as such you absolutely believe people who differ in mind will be tortured forever. Not only disrespectful but you are also a bad person. That's your opinion of what kind of person I am but I am just going to shrug it off because I don't really care what you insult me about.	0
Those aren't good examples. Neither of the communities that you spoke about were diverse. One had 98% Mexican-Americans, and the other was 1 white person in a community of blacks.	I wasn't trying to say those communities were diverse. Those example were meant to point out the communication problems that arise between people from different cultures. Go to any college campus to see the voluntarily segregated communities I described.	0

Exactly what Pyg said.  This is just another example of religion trying vainly to survive by adapting to a changing world.  It is clear that less and less people each day are okay with accepting the rediculous theory of God as well as the teachings of christianity as they were written in the bronze age. The only way for religion to survive is to change it's deffinitions to be more compatible with modern humanity's intellegence by creating philosophic bullcrap scenarios in which a god COULD exist.  In reality these new definitions completely run astray from the initial religions, which is exactly what this is doing. It isnt christianity anymore if god is an idea in our heads (which he is). Christianity is a belief that God is a tangible being that can not only interfere with our world, but created it. Saying anything other than that is corrupting the belief.	This is just another example of religion trying vainly to survive by adapting to a changing world. Religion has been evolving all along and will continue to do so. I'd rather religion evolve and adapt. It is clear that less and less people each day are okay with accepting the rediculous theory of God as well as the teachings of christianity as they were written in the bronze age. There is more than one ridiculous theory of god, one of which is that god doesn't exist. God might be described poorly, but god exists at the very least as an idea. The only way for religion to survive is to change it's deffinitions to be more compatible with modern humanity's intellegence by creating philosophic bullcrap scenarios in which a god COULD exist. The only way for humanity to survive is to improve the way it practices religion. That you want to argue against an improved view of these concepts is clear. In reality these new definitions completely run astray from the initial religions, which is exactly what this is doing. The initial religions? You talk about religion as if it's not an ongoing process subject to change over time. Christianity is not today what it once was. Tomorrow Christianity will be different than today, So will you, but we'll still call you AveSatanas It isnt christianity anymore if god is an idea in our heads (which he is). That's like saying that if I remove a brain tumor from your head, you won't be you anymore. And BTW admitting that god is an idea in our heads is dangerously close to conceding. Christianity is a belief that God is a tangible being that can not only interfere with our world, but created it. Christianity is a group of people that for various reasons decide to identify as such. Some of which are atheists. Saying anything other than that is corrupting the belief. That's the kind of thinking conducive to religious stagnation	0

People are forced to be homeless if they can't find or afford a place to live. But even if they are offered a place by teh authorities some homeless people choose to be homeless because tehy are so used to the total independence of their way of life that tehy don't want to change that.  Many homelss people are mentally ill and/or addicted toalcohol and other drugs. Of course you could argue that they haven't contributed anything so they can't expect any help but I would argue that they are ill in a way and deserve help. Every way of helping poor people, by government or by private charity, creates a perverse incentive because it reduces the pressure to work hard to get out of poverty yourself. But in some cases the perverse incentive is the lesser evil because letting people die or liev in misery would be cruel.	Thank you for giving that interesting point.  Homeless should help themselves and not rely on others for codependency but the truth is many of them have accepted the fact that they can't do that and so defend on the street asking for spare change and so fourth. So I do agree to that.  Where can we possibly supply the money to help these poor masses? Welfare you say? The government is digging into taxpayer money to pay for many other problems, and this just adds another weight onto their shoulders. Just too much is being spent on things to try to help this one group when it could be spent on things for the contributing members of society to use. This money should not be spent on the homeless. They aren't helping to pay for anything through taxes. There are about 300,000 homeless people in Canada and about 750,000 in the United States. (http://housinghomeless.ca...) When put into proportion these numbers can become quite significant. To provide every single one of these people with shelter would become quite expensive. Also, in many urban areas it may be hard to set aside land to build social housing. Many tax-payers would much rather have their tax dollars go towards things that directly benefit them, like healthcare and education.	0

I believe that limiting the time students have to stay, and or wait, for their rides is a good idea. The reason for that is simply because of the violence and fighting that occurs when a group of students are together with no super vision.

Think a little bit more about it. Imagine all of the suffering you would have to live through. You would have to live through the lives and deaths of everyone around you.

Big government and overly powerful corporations go hand in hand. Corporations in many ways control the government using bought out officials. They create new regulations to stifle the competition and increase their profits. If we decrease the size of government we actually decrease the power of big business.

Hi, marriage started with Adam and Eve the first humans on earth. Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. therefore man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh. Also I never said that it came from religion I only said God created marriage.	You're assuming that everyone believes the stories of the Bible. There is so much evidence showing that the Bible is not a reliable source of information, that we can't take anything is says at face value. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that we evolved, and that the story of Adam and Eve never actually happened. Even many Christian religions have come to accept this given the overwhelming amount of evidence supporting evolution. I think we would be going to far off topic if we start debating evolution, but if you want to I can create a new debate about it.	0
"I say there are ""brutal ways"" to kill an animals and ""not so brutal"" ways, at least in a modern man mindset.  And so, shooting a horse in the head is probably the quicker, less bloody, messy way to go about it. Less Brutal Where other more medieval, or slicing and dicing is a bit messy and can be unsanitary. More Brutal However, a part of me believe our ancestors way of using stones and sticks to kill their prey, it probably was messy, and perhaps unsanitary, but obviously the immune systems adapts in ways and doesn't in others.  In the end, whichever way a human kills another animal, should be considered ""all fair game"". That is, if a human uses rope, or a stone, or a hammer, or a gun, or a sword. If that person can use as much as possible from that particular hunted animal, for food, clothing and shelter, then it really doesn't matter, does it?  Humans are animals with free will, and we are different than other animals. We are the hunters. And so for a human to utilize animals for their benefits I see no problem and in fact I feel like animals are here for humans to utilize if they so choose. If a human kills an animal for fun, without using it for food or clothing, than obviously there are issues.  Otherwise, ""anything goes."""	There is not an 'anything goes' to anything. To each privelidge we have a responsibilty, and that responsibilty in this case is to allow more dignity to our prey. Killing as a demonstration is wrong. You should kill only to survive. I was horrified by this video as humans have a debt of honour to horses and blatantly spitting on that debt... well, it's so human, isn't it? I am ashamed to be of the same race as that man. May he have his throat ripped out by a rabid tiger.	0
And then the human race contracts a new type of AIDS/Syphilis or something else that kills you. Cool	Kirk is a responsible captain, angelmew. He, after learning of this disease, would not spread it.

Obviously, the vulcans will come up with a cure for it anyways. See, because they're not gonna deal with that shit, and they deal in logic rather than emotion, so they'll probably understand that itchyballs should not be staved off with various creams sold in stores, and instead should have a permanent fix. That's right. Star Trek. James T. Kirk. Itchy Balls. We just did it, gentlemen. We just did it.	0
"I wouldn't say it's ""acceptable"", but I wouldn't go the other way either. Because the problem pops up only when it is a matter of policy of masses. The big no-no of drug prohibition is a simple: ""What if everyone start using?"" or ""What would you say if your son does it?"" Though it is very clear that the majority of illegal drug users are there for the thrill, I wouldn't start categorizing, but most of marijuana smokers wouldn't have smoked at all if it wasn't illegal, because it wouldn't be on the tv, radio, newspapers etc.. There just wouldn't be a buzz around it. The real question is: Whether one may lock another behind the bars for something that he digested, used, smoked etc.. And to spice things up, one, more likely, will have some a priori quotes of facts he had learnt by heart, while the other one knows that if there is any brain damage related to drugs - it is in the non-user experience. Correct me if I'm wrong. A patient may receive a treatment that might harm a system in his body in order to save another system. It is the PATIENT'S responsibility, after the doctor's approval, to decide whether it pays, should he take that risk. I've heard of treatments that are illegal in the US, so patients that believe in it, travel all the way to chine, to a specific hospital to obtain it. If it makes people feel better, if it makes some inspire themselves to become a better compound and companion in the psychological \ social \ physical environment, why stand between the man and his fruit?"	"Again, this isn't about legality. ""The real question is: Whether one may lock another behind the bars for something that he digested, used, smoked etc.. And to spice things up, one, more likely, will have some a priori quotes of facts he had learnt by heart, while the other one knows that if there is any brain damage related to drugs - it is in the non-user experience.""  What exactly did you mean by this? Can you put it another way for me, please.  Also, what do you mean when you say: ""I wouldn't say it's ""acceptable"", but I wouldn't go the other way either.""  How can you say that it's only an issue in large social groups, do you know why it's an issue at all? What is wrong with one person doing it? If one wishes, and one is alone with no social pacts intact, then one may do, really, anything that one can do. Add a social group and the dynamics change, do they not? Why only then does it become an issue?"	0
Without money I wouldn't be able to go to university, afford food, or accomodation. So yes it is important to me.	Without money, you could still have food, be accommodated and still be educated. You can't blame the money for going without those things. Just the system that is modern society.	0
Then why is a all powerful all good god allowing people to go to hell because of the devil?	God is not allowing people to go to hell. Its the person's choice to believe in God or not, God is simply not forcing you to believe in Him its your choice and your choice can lead you in the wrong/right direction.  God will get rid of the devil after the Tribulation Hour has occurred (that is after the rapture) then He comes and defeats Satan.	0

Ok then bubbles happen no matter what. Also the government increased tariffs after the crash, which is pretty anti freetrade and the economy went up in flames.  How many monopolies were actually bad for people?	Ok then bubbles happen no matter what. No, they happen when loopholes exist, and especially during lax regulations. Also the government increased tariffs after the crash, which is pretty anti freetrade and the economy went up in flames.  Increased tariffs stimulates local businesses by making their goods relatively cheaper compared to foreign goods.  How many monopolies were actually bad for people? Pretty much all of them, in one way or another. Microsoft's near-monopoly on operating system deployment has made the personal computer experience stagnant. The oil oligarchy has made our attempts to transition to cleaner fuels very slow. The entertainment industry's monopoly control over our media has created a lucrative business selling bland television shows, music and movies.	0
As much as I hate subsides, they are necessary. It actually cost more to produce a bushel of corn than what you can sell it for in the USA. Besides this you really don't want food to pay for itself without government aid, it would cost you more at the store, restaurant, etc. The government helps keep your cost of food down. What most don't understand is that food stamps are not a welfare item, they are an agriculture expense. Part of the USA agriculture budget covers these.  I would like to see less individual subsidies and more in the way of loans to foreign nations to buy food. The government needs to make it cheaper to produce a crop. There is a tech fee that Monsanto Corporation has attached to every unit of seed beans sold. Monsanto has patented Roundup resist soybeans and even if you keep back some of the crop produced for seed beans, Monsanto still gets a tech fee. How one company managed to pull this off is beyond me. Monsanto has the government enforcing this. Things like this need to end. Monsanto only gets this tech fee from USA farmers, the rest of the world has no such law. Because of this Brazil can produce soybeans for less than USA can. Conclusion, subsidies need in place until the USA cleans up its laws.	Government intervention in the marketplace contradicts the values of free-trade advocated by the USA. Our complex series of agricultural subsidies, price supports, regulations and protective tariffs means that farming in the US functions as a command economy. Therefore, we have a socialist agricultural system. Furthermore, such subsidies violate international agreements negotiated and signed by the US, such as the World Trade Organization, and the North America Free Trade Act (NAFTA). This tarnishes US credibility.	0
I understand the sentiment. Really. But the question almost makes it sound like they was some sort of conspiracy going on. The ref certainly had no reason to biased it's call wasn't technically wrong. It was a bit nit-picky, but this isn't your high school soccer match. It's the Olympics, it's the gold medal. The stakes are high.	the ref certainly did have a reason to bias a call. Its called viewership of team USA in the final. I certainly don't believe the game was flat out RIGGED but a few calls here and there to give USA the advantage is something that easily could have been pulled off. And even in your argument you write the stakes are high. Is the six second goalie possession call ever made without a warning in a high stakes game? and then the penalty was a weak call given the circumstances. Im assuming your a soccer fan for having the union jack as your avatar (sue me for stereotyping) and any soccer fan would agree that two weak calls leading to a late game tying goal is unacceptable. what I'm trying to get at conspiracy or not, the canadians did not deserve those two poor calls, and many (at least here in canada) would agree it cost us the game.	0
"""Which non-sexist society are you referring to?""  I'm referring to a hypothetical society. I think that if sexism was non existent, people would still use sex to sell products or entice viewers. I'm saying that without the sexism already there, these uses of sex would not promote sexism since they would be viewed differently. That magazine exists in the form it does right now because that is what a large number of women want to read. If women weren't interested in those topics that exact magazine would not exist. If that magazine re-enforces sexist ideas then the women reading it are the ones that are doing the victimizing, not the magazine."	I disagree with your first point, or at least I think that it would happen in a way that did not portray women as just sex objects or second-class citizens. Again, blatant racial stereotypes were once perfectly acceptable in all forms of media, advertising included, but now, in a society that has made some progress in that area, they would not achieve the same effect and in fact would probably be rather harmful to business. In a hypothetical culture where the objectification of women is recognized and never excused or dismissed, sex may still sell but objectification would not.  Women who conform without introspection, and do not question America's stereotypes are part of the problem. But I do not think women are naturally predisposed to want to read the kind of vapid and vaguely insulting articles Cosmo is offering. Unfortunately, this, and other magazines like it, is the default entertainment offered to young girls who are looking to the world around them for reference as they develop an identity and explore their role in society. Ideally, girls would have a large variety of strong female role models for inspiration, but that simply is not the way it is. The disproportionately small amount of empowered women in the public eye are drowned out by the women in publications like that magazine, which is chiefly concerned with sex, fashion, and celebrities. Eventually, an affinity for things like that become so ingrained in a young person's persona that it really does become a part of them; a 'fake till you make it' effect, sort of, except most of these girls do not even realize what is happening to them. I don't doubt that the people who publish this type of media are totally aware of that and capitalize on young people's desire to fit in.	0

"God doesn't damn his children and bring condemnation on them. Its actually Satan that does that not God.  That's why I believe in reincarnation, (not that I wouldn't mind an eternal darkness, it just doesn't quite make sense to me) because I strongly believe some part of us does live on after death. I think that once we die, our souls pass through into the ""otherworld"" or an afterlife, to go through karmic debts paid, and new debt to go. The afterlife is like a paradise, a vacation if you will. And once you are ready to incarnate into your next life, all ""wrongdoings"" in your previous life will result in issues in your next life. Lessons that you need to learn from in order to grow spiritually Reincarnation is flawed because if someone is clinically dead and comes back they aren't a new person or animal they are back as the same person as they once were."

I've been waiting 100 days for the 100 days to be up! It looks pretty good to me thus far.

He's been a very busy President thus far as well with so many irons in the fire...he's a great multi-tasker, I think! The Economy is coming around nicely or so say the experts and I am glad for all that suffer out there and are still suffering from lay-offs and unemployment woes...but that too has seen an upturn in the time-line of benefits available. I like this man and where he's going on Iraq, Afghanistan, Central and South America, Canada Europe and all of it.

"I do not think that Puerto Rico should become a state of the United States mostly do to costs. As it is, our economy is doing horribly right now, but that's another argument. Puerto Rico, at the moment, gets food stamps, welfare, voting privileges, and many of the things we, (the US citizens) get, without having to pay taxes. Why buy the cow, when the milk is free? Another change required would be changing our flag. Each star represents a state and each stripe one of the original 13 colonies. This would cost even more money. Lastly, I believe that Puerto Rico and the United States are doing fine how they are, so why try to change things?

"""To do any less than this is to promote crime."" How is this reasonable? You are equating the lack of action, an inherently neutral response to promoting crime which implies active support for the said crime.  Furthermore, if we are talking about legal consequences to deal with keeping silent as a crime itself, that goes against the fact that in order for something to be considered a crime, it has to fulfill both the actus reus and the mens rea. Keeping silent, at best could only be considered under the actus reus as a fault of omission but there is no guilty or criminal intent behind the act of simply keeping quiet."

"I like how you decide to put only negative examples as what can take the place of God. Why not friends, family, love, empathy, or generosity? Do these require a belief in god?

There are certain qualities which I hold in high esteem, and those people which I care about, and even activities that I enjoy doing.

"A example of why I don't think it would work... Most of the jobs out there are menial labor jobs, like being a life guard or working the counters of some store, or even acting, or other things in the entertainment industry. Without money who would do these things? Or is the idea ""Contribute and you get what you want"" And if that were the case then it wouldn't be any different then now really. Except you skip the middle man, money."	Menial jobs like you stated would be more of a community thing, but as far as store clerks or any other job those can be automated but lets remember there is no money so clerks would just be pretty much inventory and that can be automated, jobs like teachers and such would be left to those that truly love to teach making learning that much better for our children, also lets not forget a good 50% of all jobs as we know today would be gone because those jobs are based on a monetary system, the only thing that would be left are intellectual jobs, like teaching, medicine and such. A good 90% of all our need can be automated by machines in some way even our lawns, having no money would leave us humans to unlock our fullest potential to advance humanity, think of it like this, what is your hobby?.... some people fix cars in there garage others think of inventions, those things are what people love to do without pay, hell they spend money on those things, picture a world where every human can pursue there passion and master what they love, think of the human advancement, we would unlock warp drive/time travel and be traveling the stars, but only if money was no object, money is hold back humanity. Without money our frame of mind would change, people would start to be kind with each other, its our nature to support one another, money among other things is what keeps us apart, things that can't be done by machines can be done by volunteers or a community chore list (think jury duty) of some sort, I dream of a day that we all on earth become what we are truly meant to be, bother and sister together living in our home and our only goal is to try to make home and ourselves better and work on making the human species immortal, one big earth like family with all of us in mind, only then will we be able to unlock what we where mean to be and maybe get to understand our true meaning and why where even exist.	0

blah, this was actually a reply to on of the statements above, and I got the maker of the debate (you right?) confused  with the person I was replying to, and kind of jumbled them into one chimera. So it may not make tons of sense... tried to change it, but a couple votes were cast mid-correction so I couldn't and kinda gave up. I don't like thewayitis' (who the reply was to) general attitude in the debates of his I've run into (plus I find his name kinda presumptious) so I'm always harsh with him. I'll get back to you with a more political arguement when I have a chance.	It is so easy to rattle your cage. I like how you always try to change the premise of something to get it to fit neatly into your world. If one definition is wrong then another is just as wrong. All definitions of religion should be taken into consideration. Arguments should be directed to both meanings of the word, your meaning is no better than the definition that I put forth. It is only equal to it.	0

Adam and Eve created the Aids virus by sinning. Adam and Eve created NOTHING by sinning. They only pushed the world away from God. This caused God's perfect world to naturally start degenerating, as nature tends to do that. This degeneration created the Aids virus out of something else, just like you believe dogs came from something else. Creation doesn't deny Natural Selection, it denies Particles to People evolution. How could a virus that did not exist before, come into existence out of thin air? How could a cell that did not exist before cone into existence out of thin air? You would argue it didn't come out of 'thin air', it came from a prettied-up primordial soup. I'm not saying it came out of nowhere, I'm saying it was something else and changed into the Aids virus. Adam and Eve cannot create life out of thin air.  You're right. They couldn't and didn't. Sin is not a 'thing' it is an action. Sin is actually a state of being, not an action. It is used as a verb to categorize verbs that separate people from God. That separation is sin, and that causes degeneration.	Adam and Eve created NOTHING by sinning.

But isn't it unjust to take away a proprietor's economic freedoms? No. Everybody must follow rules for the good of society. Soon their political freedoms will be stolen as a result of their loss of economic freedom. I read you as saying that soon they won't be able to buy political favours. A business should not dabble in politics. It's happening in America as proprietors are becoming restricted and thus becoming pariahs. Being restricted isn't the same as being an outcast. You know that great depression we just went through, that ended in companies receiving a blank check from the government (at our expense) to correct their affairs? That was the result of a lack of restrictions on their behaviours a decade ago. Restrictions keep these companies in line, and keep the workers safe. Our administration considers them the face of all evil. Actually, it doesn't, because they buy out our politicians each election. That's why social change happens at such a sluggish rate, too many political favours to keep for those companies.	You know that great depression we just went through, that ended in companies receiving a blank check from the government (at our expense) to correct their affairs?  Great Depression? Wow, you are drinking Obama's kool aid. Buzzed, wrong, try again. Since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. So if companies fail as did GM, they fail and not bail them out. Federal Government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's. <a href='http://www.propublica.org/special/government-bailouts'>Bailout	0
What I said is not racist at all, it is fact .	When you say things like black people are being kept down or oppressed. You're making a general statement. I am an exception, i work at a job full of exceptions, I have friends, who are the exception. I live in a community of black people that act as the exception. It's not fact, it's only one side. What race are you, if you don't feel the need to tell me, there isn't one, but if you Google it and 'oppression' you'll find some info as well. We are all subject to the woes of economical hard times black people specifically are not being singled out by the government.	0

"If such a thing were to happen, then science would not be adequate methodology to study it. Neither would religion however, since religion is not a means of gaining knowledge about the world. But we have. Gravity. There is no logical reason why mass should attract other mass other than it just does. Science asks us to accept this fact (it's an easy one to accept, because anyone can test it). Sure you can talk about it curving space, but how does it, and why? If curving is your explanation, than you ask me to accept that mass curves space because it just does. So you really haven't gotten anywhere, you've just added a step. No they don't. They have the process of finding the conclusion in mind. Than why do I hear/read scientific stories that say things like ""Well, since life began on the planet, it must have been ,"" and they then test to see if it works. That seems like conclusions preceding evidence, to me. You would be mistaken. Evolution was determined to be solid, through the typical scientific process. Now it is accepted as fact because it would require an equal theory, 150 years of complexity, and which equally accounts for the evidence, to assume otherwise. This is why we treat gravity as fact, as well. But if we're not allowed to pursue other options because evolution is fact, we'll never come up with a theory with 150 years behind it! The heliocentric theory didn't have as much time behind it as the geocentric did. If people waited until it did, it never would, because as long as people hold out, any new idea will be forever younger than the old one."	"But we have. Gravity. There is no logical reason why mass should attract other mass other than it just does. In Newtonian Mechanics the mechanism of gravity is opaque but the discoveries and revisions that Einstein made allowed us to model the effects of mass on space. Thus we know that mass attracts other mass because it deforms space in such a way that it must move into it. This is verified by gravitational lensing, in which a sufficiently massive star bends space so that light from behind the star is visible in front of it. Sure you can talk about it curving space, but how does it, and why? If curving is your explanation, than you ask me to accept that mass curves space because it just does. So you really haven't gotten anywhere, you've just added a step. Some things cannot be broken down any further, they are axioms. Other things, like the interaction of mass with space, might be broken down further but each step is, to quote Gell-Mann, ""like taking a layer off of an onion."" Getting closer and closer to the axiom. Than why do I hear/read scientific stories that say things like ""Well, since life began on the planet, it must have been ,"" and they then test to see if it works. That seems like conclusions preceding evidence, to me. You really need a less ambiguous sentence example, however on the origin of life we are not completely ignorant and know enough to suggest that it formed here. But if we're not allowed to pursue other options because evolution is fact, we'll never come up with a theory with 150 years behind it! Why would you pursue options which contradict that which works? Evolution accounts for all the evidence, and explains more than adequately the diversity of life. Why would you seek to abandon something so complete and functional? The heliocentric theory didn't have as much time behind it as the geocentric did. If people waited until it did, it never would, because as long as people hold out, any new idea will be forever younger than the old one. Heliocentric theory better explained observations and did so in a more elegant way (meaning it required less complex math and tricks to make the data work)."	0

It would be rash to make any kind of conclusion based on so little information. I'd hazard a guess that it was planted there by someone, but with so little information, who knows?

The navy (and plenty others) also got interested and did xrays on it, and the surface of it is half an inch thick and can withstand 120,000 pounds of force, the xray also found 2 round objects in it, surrounded by a ""halo"" with a strange density, and that it has 4 magnetic poles.

I don't mind their anti-monopoly policies but they really need to pull that dildo out of their ass and stop censoring shit.  The standards to define obscene are way too vague and often times they make a ruling that is clearly wrong.	They don't censor anything political or what not. Plus, there is a captive audience when it comes to the radio and TV...meaning that since the airwaves are limited choice is extremely limited and you just can't choose to not see something. Besides obscenity is not protected by the 1st amendment.  Miller v California sets community standards as the method of determining obscenity... that means it is up to the community determine what is okay and what is not	0
I hold natural rights to be inherent to a rational human being. By which I mean that a human being properly using the faculties of his mind to assess his well-being naturally comes to conclusions about means to promote that well-being when in contact with other human beings. If we are not dealing with a rational individual who isn't concerned with his well-being, than no, natural rights are not an inherent part of how we interact with him.	"I hold natural rights to be inherent to a rational human being. Human beings are not rational in the slightest, I site a book that are key in understanding this Denial by Ajit Varki & Danny Brower. It has several passages providing our tendencies to accept ""realities"" that are comfortable, however not real. Money and rights are among these categories."	0
The governor should think twice before he get rid of sports school. Firstly sports serves as a barrier to prevent juveniles from committing crimes by keeping them involved in activities that will build their self esteem. Cut out their sport schools and juveniles will react by engaging in criminal activity which will cause an increase in the crime rate and the governor will still have to spend and allocate more resources and money towards crime fighting and secondly, sport schools can hold sporting events which can serve as a means of tourism and hold events such as competitions that can bring in a source of finance.	I like your argument, up vote. Sports do take up time and can stop those who would otherwise be committing crimes from committing them, but due to the time sports and schools take up. The self-esteem level of a student is not a good indicator of how lily they are to commit a crime, at most it increases their likelihood of drug use which might then cascade into other crimes but as a first cause to crime in general I fail to see the correlation. Most crimes require confidence, a belief in oneself and one's success, in order to be effectively carried out such that they do succeed. A shaky gun hand, a hesitant foot on the accelerator etc would quickly serve as a negative influence on them being criminals. IF anything, low self-esteem decreases the likelihood of committing a crime.  In order to stop a increase in crime schools could promote private substitutes for their sport programs or offer clubs which operate on membership dues.  A sport team which can pay for itself is certainly not one to disappear, especially one which turns a profit. The majority of sports do not raise much revenue though.	0

"Yeah... you ignored what I said. The hot chicks in beer commercials are meant to get guy's attention. It would be stupid to actually think that people think ""if I buy this beer, women will like me"". It's just to get the eyes focused on the product: ""Girls? Hot ones? Interesting."" And with stuff like deodorant spray, let's face it, woman love good smells more than bad smells. Deodorant spray is SUPPOSED to convince guys that this one will attract more females than the competitors. It's part of advertisement. Same thing with clothes and ""male enhancement"". The whole purpose of guys wearing nice clothes, smelling good and using penis pills is to attract females. It is really the best way to advertise these products cause it goes directly for the reason why these guys are buying this crap in the first place."	"Please don't refer to my opinions as stupid. Insults do nothing to further your argument. I feel like I adequately addressed all the points you were trying to make - which one did I miss, exactly? Advertisements insinuate a lot of things that, plainly presented, people would consider foolish. But when these messages are subliminal, and presented to impressionable minds a hundred times a day, they do have an effect. This effect is observable in many ways, such as the sad prevalence of poor body image and eating disorders in teenagers and young girls ( <a href='http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/anorexia/statistics.htm'>http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/anorexia/statistics.htm  - <a href='http://www.annecollins.com/eating-disorders/statistics.htm'>http://www.annecollins.com/eating-disorders/statistics.htm  ) Where do you think these insecurities come from? Could it possibly be from the constant deluge of super-skinny, Photoshop-gorgeous models and actresses that young girls are exposed to from babyhood? Could it be the literal thousands of beauty products that she is told she needs in order to be beautiful? 'It's just to get the eyes focused on the product: ""Girls? Hot ones? Interesting.""' Thank you, that is the point I am trying to make. Women are not people, to be portrayed in a variety of roles by a variety of people in all shapes and colors.

Who gets to wear clothes more often? Who gets presented as clever, funny, powerful, and who gets presented as vulnerable, submissive, or simply as a prop? Which gender is permitted a wider range of 'looks', from tall to short, scruffy to neat, heavy to thin, geeky to good-looking, and which gender is restricted to the narrow 'look' of tall, shapely, long-legged, and extremely skinny?"	0

They would probably be much more well trained and would be able to have a permanent career since thats what a standing army does.  A good example to look at is Switzerland.

There is more than one ridiculous theory of god, one of which is that god doesn't exist. God might be described poorly, but god exists at the very least as an idea. The only way for religion to survive is to change it's deffinitions to be more compatible with modern humanity's intellegence by creating philosophic bullcrap scenarios in which a god COULD exist. The only way for humanity to survive is to improve the way it practices religion. That you want to argue against an improved view of these concepts is clear. In reality these new definitions completely run astray from the initial religions, which is exactly what this is doing. The initial religions? You talk about religion as if it's not an ongoing process subject to change over time. Christianity is not today what it once was. Tomorrow Christianity will be different than today, So will you, but we'll still call you AveSatanas It isnt christianity anymore if god is an idea in our heads (which he is). That's like saying that if I remove a brain tumor from your head, you won't be you anymore. And BTW admitting that god is an idea in our heads is dangerously close to conceding. Christianity is a belief that God is a tangible being that can not only interfere with our world, but created it. Christianity is a group of people that for various reasons decide to identify as such. Some of which are atheists. Saying anything other than that is corrupting the belief. That's the kind of thinking conducive to religious stagnation	My fucking iPod shit out my whole argument. I'll dispute you tomorrow on the computer.	0
Such a stupid question, what about similar does gravity exist. I assume that you are one of those believing in 6000 years old universe BS ?

Bits of evidence are left behind, like certain radioactive isotopes and we can observe the formation of stars in the universe with our massive telescopes. We look at history every day when we look to the sky, because our universe is so vast and light travels so slowly. We can observe the past-formation of stars, exploding supernovas, etc. I understand the concept of time being distance.  Science does not work by invoking magic, or sacrificing animals to an altar. It relies on the knowable, which requires that we do not invoke supernatural, magical concepts. I realize that science doesn't, or shouldn't evoke magic. But what happens when we come across something that cannot be explained by nature? There are many questions science cannot answer right now (origins are usually the category--life, the universe, the first stars, etc.) But the scientists looking for the answers think they know them already. In doing experiments, they already have the conclusion in mind. When finding the origin of life, they know that all life had a single ancestor, and thus they're much, much, much more likely to disregard the contrary evidence (as I don't do these experiments, I'm not sure if there is any, but I'm sure if there was, it wouldn't be published) as faulty data. What I see science doing now is finding evidence to prove a conclusion, when it should be finding conclusions to fit the evidence. What then are your objections remaining? We see that languages diverge, create new words and grammar schemes, so how can you maintain that language is getting simpler when more keep popping up? Language as a whole might be getting more complex, but languages are getting more simple. That's my argument. I honestly don't really care about modern languages, but comparing what we have to what we had. Comparing modern languages to ancient Asian, Mesopotamian, American (north and south), and Scandinavian. All those old languages are much more complex than what we have today.	"I realize that science doesn't, or shouldn't evoke magic. But what happens when we come across something that cannot be explained by nature? As far as can be ascertained, we haven't ever come across this and have no reason to believe that we will. If such a thing were to happen, then science would not be adequate methodology to study it. Neither would religion however, since religion is not a means of gaining knowledge about the world. There are many questions science cannot answer right now (origins are usually the category--life, the universe, the first stars, etc.) But the scientists looking for the answers think they know them already. There is a difference between not having the answer, or a complete answer, and being incapable of providing an answer. The only natural things which may be out of the capacity of science are multiverse and ""before the big bang"" (if either of these things even exist or are possible). They are conjecture, however. In doing experiments, they already have the conclusion in mind. No they don't. They have the process of finding the conclusion in mind. When finding the origin of life, they know that all life had a single ancestor,  No, this is just a proposed hypothesis. There is also the hypothesis that we had multiple beginning ancestors, which merged in various degrees due to horizontal gene flow. and thus they're much, much, much more likely to disregard the contrary evidence (as I don't do these experiments, I'm not sure if there is any, but I'm sure if there was, it wouldn't be published) as faulty data. Your premise is faulty and so this statement follows. What I see science doing now is finding evidence to prove a conclusion, when it should be finding conclusions to fit the evidence. You would be mistaken. Evolution was determined to be solid, through the typical scientific process. Now it is accepted as fact because it would require an equal theory, 150 years of complexity, and which equally accounts for the evidence, to assume otherwise. This is why we treat gravity as fact, as well. Language as a whole might be getting more complex, but languages are getting more simple. That's my argument. I honestly don't really care about modern languages, but comparing what we have to what we had. Comparing modern languages to ancient Asian, Mesopotamian, American (north and south), and Scandinavian. All those old languages are much more complex than what we have today. Being more streamlined doesn't mean innate simplicity. For example with English, it has been streamlined to use fewer odd characters, and unwieldy tenses. However in the last millennium it also gained complexity by means of borrowing heavily from other languages. It is now more complex than Old English, but also easier to learn, arguably, because it is more approachable. It's kind of like with cetaceans, they were originally land mammals but became streamlined to swim in the ocean. Their outward form became simpler but they grew in complexity by diverging into Dolphins, Whales, etc. and gaining new structures."	0
As far as I see it, hate the player, not the game. If paedophiles are harassing young children, then get the police to go round and throw them in jail, don't ruin the internet for the vast majority that don't want to fiddle children.

"For what (should be) obvious reasons... NO.  Suppose a married couple wants to bring in a third.  Seeing as we all have ""equal"" rights... what happens when any one of the three falls in love with a fourth and wants to marry that person too?

-Procrastination to the point of failure is a sign of one who is weak of mind.- Are we in Soviet Russia? Your average teenager hasn't developed mentally to the point of understanding consequence. In other words a student will more likely than not once in their life ( chances are many times ) will procrastinate to the point of bombing a project of test. Some learn quicker than others, however holding the ideal that one who procrastinates is a basic fool is a mistake on your part. -so if a student happened to cheat on all of his/her tests taken within the comfort of their home will more than likely fall into the less than 1/8th percentage of students who drop out or fail online courses.- Did you know that 39% of all statistics are made up on the spot? Do you have a website to prove anything remotely close to this?	Your average teenager... mistake on your part. I'll give that one to you, as I know this is factual from taking different psychology courses. Which is an excellent point.

"How is Atheism ""a trend"" if 77% of Americans are Christians?  You do know most of those ""Christians"" aren't true Christians and don't live a Godly lifestyle. They just do whatever and think Jesus is okay with it. So they call themselves Christians. That is why it is a growing trend. Almost 96% of the youth leave the faith so the numbers are growing. According to a poll Atheists are the most mistrusted minority in the United States! Mistrusted? May I see this poll that claims they are mistrusted? Because us Christians are frowned upon greatly. I think all you want is for Atheists to be in the minority for the sake of a Christian majority so you can be content. I don't even see why you would claim or think that.

That very first link. The one to the Mathematics of Evolution.	"Ok... ""Seven Scientific Reasons"" huh?  Opening paragraph: Long rant about how there's a giant evolutionist conspiracy to keep the truth from reaching people... standard creationist whinging, moving on... First ""Scientific Reason """"Genetic entropy"" is a scientific fact which is admitted by all prominent geneticists. "" This is a bald faced lie. ""Genetic entropy"" is a term IDers (specifically, John Sanford) just recently invented. It is taken seriously by effectively... nobody. Except IDers. Yes... mutations happen. Yes.. INDIVIDUALS don't have a lot of mechanisms to undo them. This does not correlate to ""deterioration"" on an evolutionary scale... which deals with the genomes of entire species over multiple generations and not whether Sally suffered a deleterious mutation that gave her some nasty genetic disorder... unless you're twisting things to suit your religious biases like Sanford is doing. Plenty of mutations are actually beneficial. And harmful mutations are constantly weeded out of the genome of a population by negative selective pressures. Actual, real life entropy is describing a NON REVERSIBLE energy transfer dictated by the basic laws of physics. This bears no relationship to completely reversible mutations being introduced into a species population. They simply paste on the word ""entropy"" because it sounds more scientific and impressive then saying ""Man is fallen into sin and the world is deteriorating""... which is what they're actually arguing when you get past the hand waving and misdirection. This is the perfect illustration of why this argument is the height of idiocy: ""If the theory of evolution were true, and all of our ancestors and ancestor species only had 1 mutation every year on average, we humans would have 660,100,000 random defective mutations on our DNA due to genetic entropy"" Yes! Exactly! Because every single one of those defective mutations would have been passed on and inherited by the entire species! We can't explain why this would happen of course... but it totally would! Just don't think about it too hard and it all makes sense and you'll see evoution is totally impossible! This person appears to be a moron. Second ""Scientific Reason"" ""Genetic chaos"" is not a scientific fact because evolution is not a scientific fact. But if evolution were true, genetic chaos would be far more significant than genetic entropy!!"" Great... we've gone from him appropriating the made up terminology of IDers to just making up his own. I will give him this though: ""There is an assumption in the theory of evolution that when an extra copy of a gene or chromosome is accidentally made, that the mutations needed to complete the transition to a new species all occur in exactly the right locations on the DNA. This is nonsense."" Nonsense is the word for it! Evolution never requires in advance that any mutation to occur in any specific location. Ever. My initial impression that this person is a moron is reinforced. Third ""Scientific Reason"" """"Genetic debris"" is not a scientific fact because evolution is not a scientific fact. But if evolution were true, genetic debris would manifest itself on our human DNA; meaning our human DNA would be vastly different than it is today if evolution were true!!"" I hope you're seeing a pattern. Yet another made up term that doesn;t actually mean anything.  ""Genetic debris has to do with the failed attempts by evolution to create new species."" There is no such thing as a ""failed attempt to create a new species"". For the simple reason that there are never ANY ""attempts"" to make a new species. And when there are chance speciation occurances they don't just happen by adding a new freaking chromosome every time!  He's talking about evolution as if it's some guy in a workshop trying to come up with new inventions. The impression this person is a moron is becoming quite firmly set. Fourth ""Scientific Reason"" ""Consecutive Impossible Proboabilities"" Yet another example of this: <a href='http://duelingdogma.blogspot.com/2010/04/people-dont-understand-probability.html'>http://duelingdogma.blogspot.com/2010/04/people-dont-understand-probability.html  (I'm so glad I wrote that... comes in handy all the time) Fifth ""Scientific Reason"" ""The large population concept works just fine for the first generation of a multi-generation evolutionary process, but after that the population size drops to two and they have to be brother and sister and they must mate and must have at least one male and one female offspring."" Ladies and gentlemen... scientific proof that domestic horses don't exist. (Hint, they're genetically distinct from wild horses... even have a different number of chromosomes in their DNA) (Bigger hint: That is NOT how speciation occurs. Speciation events are most often caused by the geographic isolation of one breeding population of a species from another... mutations continue accumulating in both populations but since mutations are random they're different mutations in each group, and the differences keep growing. And the fact that the populations are geographically isolated means there is no interbreeding to transmit the unique changes in one population to the other. And eventually the differences between the two populations are so great that voila... you have two different species. There... how freaking hard is that to understand? Really?) The conclusion that this person is a moron is now set in concrete. Sixth ""Scientific Reason"" ""With evolution there is a severe problem with this when there is a male and female. The same bulk mutations and point mutations must occur totally coincidentally in the same locations on the DNA of both a male and female, in the same generation, in the same geographical area, and they must mate."" See response to point five, this is the exact same error. This guy doesn't have the faintest clue how evolution works, and yet is devoting apparently extensive effort to telling people that do that evolution is impossible. His time would be better spent reading a biology textbook... something I can almost guarantee he never did before deciding to make an idiot of himself on the internet. Seventh ""Scientific Reason"" ""Computers are very good at creating random numbers. I have personally run many billions of computer simulations to test various aspects of the theory of evolution. But 10,000 of these simulations may be the most important. These are the simulations in which I made 10,000 attempts to create 40 million real human nucleotides."" Oh yeah, I just bet he did. And building no his demonstrated grasp on how evolution works so far he did it by just randomly making changes to a nucleotide string and then seeing what happened... without applying any selective envionmental variable at all. And then he concluded that the outcome of randomly messing with it was... wait for it... random. Evolution disproven!!! BRILLIANT!"	0
well most of them are only fighting for revenge of their dead ones. when america announced war in Iraq for oil, many innocents were killed. they are doing the same that the Americans did. I think you are confused. The Taliban have nothing to do with Iraq. The Taliban is a terrorist organization based out of Afghanistan, and the conflict goes way back to the Cold war era. The Taliban fought to keep the USSR and communism out of Afghanistan, and for this reason the US funded and trained the Taliban to fight against the soviets, but with the fall of the soviet union the Taliban turned against us.	The Taliban is a terrorist organization based out of Afghanistan, and the conflict goes way back to the Cold war era. sry, but I was aware of that. and I got confused. but I read somewhere(don't ask me where) that many innocent people were killed in the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan. this lead to them rebelling against the US.

Obesity is a comparison of BMI to height, above a certain weight for your height, and you're obese. For example, rowers are normally obese, because they have so much muscle mass. Being obese does not necessarily make you 'fat', just most people are. Whereas overweight, whilst not the most specific, or sensitive, term to use, does refer to an above average fat/body ratio, and mirrors what we consider to be 'fat', more closely. Both work, both will be used at all levels, but overweight is probably closer to what you want.	If calling obese people fat is not compatible then what do I call obese people? Watching obese people do anything is just funny.	0

Claims need evidence. Just because there is no evidence for disproving or proving a claim does not make it equal faith. For example, is it more likely that the greek gods exist. this cannot be disproved or proved. Same with the claim that unicorns live in the adromeda galaxy; yet, we can say with confidence that in all likeliness, there are no unicorns in the adromeda galaxy or an alien name bob who enjoys to make alcohol.	The myth of the Greek gods, can be disproved. They are disproved by the science that counters them. The Greek gods were devices made by the Greeks to explain things that they couldn't at the time. As technology advanced we began to garner explanations for these events, and the Greek gods became obsolete as a means of explanation.	0
Let's be reasonable. To even imagine spending every waking moment is ludicrous. If I see a crime, I report it. Shoplifters, drunk drivers, reckless drivers, are among the list. Any unusual behavior, I check it out. If it appears to be of a criminal nature, I call the sheriff's office or the police. I get involved enough that I pursue suspects until help arrives.  To do any less than this is to promote crime. To do these things is the responsibility of every citizen. Crime affects all of us. The store charges more to cover the cost of theft. Drunk drivers may cause an accident or death. Do you really want them on road the same time as your family members and friends are? Reckless drivers are a hazard as well and maybe under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or have been involved in a crime. When I see a car run through four red lights, they get reported.  Yes, I've ended up face to face with a few. I had the tar scared out of me once, but I continue to do what is the right thing to do. I wasn't really expecting to find anybody inside the neighbors barn, when they where on vacation. A car appeared to be broke down and I called it in. Meanwhile I decided to make sure everything was in its place while waiting on the sheriff's duty to arrive, I now wait for them to arrive. Stumbled across two guys looking the place over. They ran and I ran the other direction, didn't like the odds. Still caught them anyway, I had their car boxed in.	"""To do any less than this is to promote crime."" How is this reasonable? You are equating the lack of action, an inherently neutral response to promoting crime which implies active support for the said crime.  Furthermore, if we are talking about legal consequences to deal with keeping silent as a crime itself, that goes against the fact that in order for something to be considered a crime, it has to fulfill both the actus reus and the mens rea. Keeping silent, at best could only be considered under the actus reus as a fault of omission but there is no guilty or criminal intent behind the act of simply keeping quiet."	0

The definition aside, I feel like religion is an organization of worship. Atheist don't worship the belief that god doesn't exist they just accept it. Or rather they refuse to accept the existence of god, and leave it at that. There is no practices or teachings or laws dictating it. There is no hierarchy of atheism it's just disbelief in a divine creator.	Well I not all religions involve worship Buddhist monks for instance meditate rather than pray in their faith there is no god deity there is only the cosmic force known as karma and the state of total understanding called nirvana the goal of a Buddhist is not to gain favor with a god to secure a place in heaven but rather to meditate on all things and understand all things so he can assent to nirvana and join the Buddhas (enlightened ones)	0

"I don't think ""a logical conclusion"" is a good description of god. Perhaps ""A complex of questionably sound logical conclusions"" It takes a rather generous mind to consider god to be a collection of even questionably sound conclusions, let alone to ascribe logic to those conclusions. There is nothing logical whatsoever to believing in the existence of a god or gods. I would call god more of a collection of unfounded assumptions based upon personal or collective belief.  If you want to try convincing me that god is not an intellectual creation, I'm curious to read your argument. I think the argument is actually quite simple. God is not an intellectual creation because the term would imply the application of intellect in deducing the existence of the same, something which I find to be remarkably absent in all constructions of deistic belief. God is anti-intellectual and persists against reason."	It takes a rather generous mind to consider god to be a collection of even questionably sound conclusions, let alone to ascribe logic to those conclusions. If I was ignorant of the fact that logic does not only consist of the well founded variety, I would find this argument convincing. There is nothing logical whatsoever to believing in the existence of a god or gods. So long as we disagree on what an appropriate meaning for the term god is. I would call god more of a collection of unfounded assumptions based upon personal or collective belief.  Our axioms then?

But rights are an abstract concept they can never be proven to exist, and they seem to change depending on geographical location and time period. So in my estimation, no, rights don't exist.	You are right regarding legal rights, but natural rights are pretty much universal due to their very nature(no pun intended).

Although I do respect Penn Jillette, agnosticism is fundamentally indifference or apathy intertwined with uncertainty. Atheism is not uncertainty, it is certainty of disbelief.	"Well by saying ""Atheism is certainty of disbelief"" that is you basically saying Atheism is a fact even though YOU are an Agnostic. Atheism has not been proven, how do you think Atheists are certain when NOBODY IS CERTAIN!!!!"	0
I don't think you understand what I meant. Islamic women don't have a choice. Western women do.	Majority of them does not need this choice, rest of them is impacted by media. generally, they are glad.Moreover, not all Islamic women do not have a choice. But they have advantage, because they always realize themselves as women.	0
America has a lot of bat-shit crazy Christians. So, naturally, we also have a lot of atheists who are used to putting up with bat-shit crazy Christians. This doesn't mean that our atheists are also bat-shit crazy, nor does it mean that their arguments are likewise impaired. I think you might be confusing a high percentage of single-brain-celled, born again, evangelical, Republican Christians in this country for a lack of intelligent religious discourse in this country altogether, and I can tell you you're dead wrong. A) because this religious insanity says nothing about the opposition to it, atheism, and b) because we have a large number of highly respected and fiercely intelligent Christian apologists in this country, so even the religious side isn't all ignoramuses.	"I think it's very easy to just point the finger at the Christians and say that it's all their fault. However, as a non-American, I've had too many disconcerting experiences of both American religion and American atheism. For example, when discussing ""virtual particles"" in subatomic physics, I've seen American atheists suddenly screaming that this is proof that there is no god. Like...the god question isn't even been discussed! We're talking about physics and suddenly there's a raving lunatic in the room talking about something completely different. Now, I've seen both Christians and atheists doing this and it seems very much to be an American thing."	0
This all may be possible, but to just make the claim that public education leads to bullying and mass murder is... farfetch'd. I agree that privatized education would be better at combating these issues, but I'm not gonna try to say that correlation, in this case, has proven causation.	I would like to recant my statement of school shootings didn't occur before 1966. Comparing school shootings at public to private schools, the number of shootings at public schools far exceed private. For example, the top 5 most deadly school shootings have all been public schools.	0
"Christians have said that you can not be moral without being religious! Also there are some states in this country where it is illegal for an atheist to run for any kind of public office. Have you ever seen that billboard that says ""anti god is anti American, anti American is treason, traitors led to the civil war?"" now they think we caused the civil war just because they don't like us (sigh) unbelievable!"	I know all about the laws in these states constitutions. For the most part these laws are not enforced, except in cases where the person running for office publicly declares they are atheist. (Don't ask, don't tell.) Do this and the world would be a better place. As I stated, no true Christian would go after another human being. There will always be some radical group trying to cause trouble, just a fact of life. Mark Twain said, If some one goes after your name, ride out the storm. Don't feed it with a response.

Humans are animals. Yet many animals are not human.  The guy probably killed the animal for a need, because he was hungry, primarily.  He did need to kill it because he was hungry.  How to you propose humans eat meat without killing the meat they eat?  If you were attacked, non human or not, I'm sure there would be defending involved, unless of course you wanted to be attacked.  I do understand.  Slavery has nothing to do with this.  What else do you have to say?	"He didn't need to kill to eat. You don't need to eat meat. And have you forgotten the debt of honour humans hold to horses? They fought in our wars for us, were our trusted companions, helped us farm, helped us build our cities, and helped us hunt. And he clearly said, ""To all animal activists, fuck you."" Which means he was making a point by killing that horse. And it is similar to slavery. Slaves were sometimes regarded as non-sentient and unequal."	0

Maybe they should've thrown the second bomb first and then the first one if nessecary....  I'm kidding but it would be bettwer if they waited few days more, they have thrown both bombs in period of four days, also Japanese army wasn't powerful enough to deal much damage to US troops. I think that best scenario would been assassination of emperor Hirohito ( moral is decreased, they do not have leader .....)	The second bomb did cause them to give up, so maybe you are right, hehe. I think the Japanese had a never give up attitude. It seems like further delay would have led them to believe that we didn't actually have another bomb to use. The nuclear bombs were preceded by firebombings and that didn't work. The Japanese didn't surrender for another 6 days after Nagasaki. It seemed very difficult to get them to give up.	0
The thing I read said he was Schizophrenic so i'm surprised he did'nt plead diminished responsibility, if he is Schizophrenic he should be in a secure mental hospital receiving treatment, I dont think Prison or the Death Penalty is right for someone like that.

"Actually almost all of them were Deists I don't know about George Washington. Never is the word ""God"" used in the constitution.

The closest approximation in modern times to a deist would actually be a non practicing Christian rather than an atheist.	0
The CIA arranged a coup of Salvador Allende in Chile. On 11 September, 1973, a military coup removed Allende's government from power. Salvador Allende died in the fighting in the presidential palace in Santiago. General Augusto Pinochet replaced Allende as president. Pinochet was a dictator.

Self love. This refers to vanity and vanity is the first original sin. It is what caused the Arch Angel Lucifer to fall from the grace of God.

"I agree with your saying that the most rational stance is ""we have no idea how God thinks"". But like I argued, skepticism is not a practical stance to take, whether in or outside religion. Unless you subscribe to the school of thought that says we shouldn't attempt to find out anything about God at all (and it doesn't seem like you do, since you said there are some good reasons for not believing in God), you'd need to suspend your skepticism somewhat when debating religious issues. To say anything at all about God would be intellectually dishonest, if you take intellectual dishonesty to be assuming that you know something then arguing as though you do in fact know it. (Although I don't think this is dishonesty - it's just an omission of the disclaimer that you can't really know this or really know that, an omission that everybody makes all the time and assumes that you will be making too. People don't formulate all their factual sentences like: ""I think my name is Ben but I could be wrong"", ""I think it is currently five o'clock but I could be wrong"", ""I think the earth is round but I could be wrong"", do they?) Anyway - under your concept of intellectual dishonesty, any argument, logical or evidential, for or against God would be intellectually dishonest, because how can you know that God is limited by natural laws or by logical possibility? It's easy for us to imagine things violating the laws of nature - like Moses parting the Red Sea - so we tend to assume that God is capable of such feats. It's not easy at all for us to imagine things violating the principles of logic, like a circle being square, or God in his omnipotence being able to create a rock so heavy that he can't lift it. But just because we humans with our limited minds can't imagine a being that transcends logic doesn't mean this being does not exist in some way. Indeed, I think this is the very reason that God, if such a being exists, is ultimately inaccessible to us: he crosses every boundary of human intellect. The argument from evil cannot ever be a infallible argument against God. But in this respect it is no worse than any other argument that concerns God, as they are all based on either logic or empirical evidence, neither of which are infallible when applied to God. As these fallible arguments are the best that we humans have got, they're what we must work with. Whoever it was that said we should be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains fall out, has it right: there are just some things, like skepticism, that we have to close our minds against, if we are to say or do anything useful."	"I don't mind using the argument of ""evil existing"" to argue against the validity of a Christian or Islamic God. At the same time, arguing against an entire religion requires much more than just ""why is there evil?"" many priests are taught from the beginning to answer with intellectually dishonest bullshit, but at the same time, it's bullshit that is almost impossible to argue against with mere ""why does evil exist"" rational. you need to understand a religion and understand WHY faith is evident in order to be able to start your argument against it all. You have to know so much about it that if you were explaining it to someone, they would at first think that you are a believer. But for the basic idea of God or a deity, saying that ""a deity doesn't exist because evil exists"" is a fallacy. Nothing to it."	0

"I am staying on the subject. We are debating what a theist is, not what you are. Hey lame fuck, look at the title of this debate See there is your problem. God IS a higher power. Earlier you said ""I don't believe Gods are anything at all"". Which position reflects your true opinion? God by definition is a higher power. And you imply that this is the best possible definition that can be produced. I disagree You keep saying I am insulting you. I am taking the tone you set. Let me know if you'd like to return to civil discourse. Consider this - I give you facts, and you just go on and on about how I am incapable of thinking outside the box or whatever you're doing. Your opinion that the points I bring up are ridiculous is just that an opinion. Only an idiot would call them facts. 1. When did I call myself an atheist? I was crazy enough to infer that from when you said """"I don't believe Gods are anything at all"" 2. God is a higher power by definition. And you just can't conceive that it is ever appropriate to better define a word. Funny, coming from someone who makes up his own definitions of God and Theism. Every definition is made up dipshit. Some are better than others, and just because I'm comfortable challenging a predominate trend and you aren't is no reason to get all stupid about it."	"Hey lame fuck, look at the title of this debate Sorry, I thought this was the other debate. Earlier you said ""I don't believe Gods are anything at all"". Which position reflects your true opinion?

The same way that I can prove that objects accelerate with 9.8 meters pr second pr second towards the ground in a vacuum. I observe that objects will move towards the ground in this particular manner in each and every situation. Then I use inductive reasoning to prove that the above statement is a fact.  It's easy to see that people have a desire to live, if no one had that everyone would be killing themselves happily, spontanously and without internal conflict. Since this is wrong in each and every person it must be true in each and every person that they have a desire to live.	That does not prove that everyone has the desire to live.  Just because you don't have any desire to live doesn't mean you'll have the desire to inflict harm upon yourself.	0
"A study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality shows that using tap water and reusable bottles is significantly better for the environment.

In the video that you gave, you've said that using tap water and reusable bottles is significantly better for the environment, but, the problem is.. what if you do not have a reliable water source and instead of helping yourself, you get amobeiasis or other kinds of disease with it.

Because, using bottles is also detrimental in our environment, and in our body. Plastic chemicals are bad for us.	0

In general, I agree completely, but Liber's one of the theists I respect most.

Discrimination is discrimination. You ask ""When do we stop paying for past transgressions?"". My question to you: ""is the site is punishing you in any way?"" As for being in the past, racism is still going strong today, both by black people and white people. Shops still have the right to refuse entry to black (or white) people and some still do. Bad business yes, but perfectly legal. I personally have no problem with the site. It is for black people who prefer other black people. Other sites give you a choice of what race you prefer. There are also sites for people who just want sex and yet others for gay people and lesbians. Racist, perhaps, but nothing to whip yourself into a frenzy about."	0

Then if skin cells are capable of developing into a human being then maybe we should take your skin cells and develop them into a human being through a natural reproductive process. Asexual Reproduction is different from sexual reproduction and the DNA and blood type we are talking about here has to do with sexual reproduction and NOT asexual reproduction. Are flatworms humans? Do they have a human body? So why then a person is pronounced dead or alive or even to a fetus depending on the availability of the heartbeats? So then we should kill anyone who has lost their personhood, right? Because according to you the fetus shhould be killed because it is not a person? Maybe we should do that to people in coma or unconcious too. You are failing to realize that regardless of whether or not a person has personhood or not is determined by the issue at the present and not to the fact that they are already born, as demonstrated in a previous court trial. Personhood and rights given to the person is determined at the time of their condition and not based on whether or not they are already borned. Again scientists have proved that a person who becomes fully unconscious has lost their personhood by losing all the elements of personhood. So are you a scientist or a doctor to dispute this fact? So then if the fetus is like a brain dead person, then how come the brain still maintains the growth and blood circluation in the unborn? And a brain dead person is an individual who has recieved damaged to their brain resulting in a major ineffiency of the brain to control body and chemical movements which is completely the oppostie in the fetus. Again they were born but now they are dead, right? A man can be born innocent but because he commits a crime, doesn't mean that he will be innocent, will he?  So then what is the difference between the unborn and a person who has lost their personhood? Oh wait, according to you, one is already born and the other unborn. The only difference is the fetus is in a womb and you keep saying that they have no life but you have no scientific fact disputing my claim. If a fetus is made up of meat, then so is me and you because we also is made up of everything a fetus is made up of including tissues, cells, organs, blood, muscles, flesh etc. A fetus deserves the right because it is a human organism, it has life as determined by doctors and it is a growing human being.  Oh and by the way, the only difference between a baby borned on the first day and the baby about to be born is one is out of the womb and one is in, which is the only difference but a baby born already also does not have personhood.	Then if skin cells are capable of developing into a human being then maybe we should take your skin cells and develop them into a human being through a natural reproductive process. Natural reproduction doesn't matter here. Otherwise you're arguing that artificially inseminated women do not give birth to human beings. You can clone a human from skin cells. This is asexual reproduction. Are flatworms humans? Do they have a human body? So why then a person is pronounced dead or alive or even to a fetus depending on the availability of the heartbeats? A fully developed person is pronounced dead when losing a heartbeat because it is a critical process for maintaining life. A foetus is in that grey zone of not being fully developed and thus not needing a proper beating heart yet. So then we should kill anyone who has lost their personhood, right? Because according to you the fetus shhould be killed because it is not a person? Maybe we should do that to people in coma or unconcious too. A person has not lost their personhood until their brain has degenerated past a point that they lose their individuality, and are basically nothing more than a brain stem. At that point, I don't care if they live or die. Use them for livestock feed for all I care. Again scientists have proved that a person who becomes fully unconscious has lost their personhood by losing all the elements of personhood. So are you a scientist or a doctor to dispute this fact? If they have an intact brain, then they have not lost their personhood. What you probably misunderstood is that higher brain functions cease in unconscious people, but they are not gone. So then if the fetus is like a brain dead person, then how come the brain still maintains the growth and blood circluation in the unborn? And a brain dead person is an individual who has recieved damaged to their brain resulting in a major ineffiency of the brain to control body and chemical movements which is completely the oppostie in the fetus. Brain stems can control elementary body functions. A foetus doesn't have a well-developed brain. Again they were born but now they are dead, right? A man can be born innocent but because he commits a crime, doesn't mean that he will be innocent, will he?  Your question isn't formed in a way that I can answer, I need you to retype it. So then what is the difference between the unborn and a person who has lost their personhood? Oh wait, according to you, one is already born and the other unborn. The only difference is the fetus is in a womb and you keep saying that they have no life but you have no scientific fact disputing my claim. I keep saying that they have no personhood. Not every life has personhood. A braindead man has no personhood. A foetus has no personhood. A fetus deserves the right because it is a human organism, it has life as determined by doctors and it is a growing human being.  The skin cells you scrape off when you brush against a sharp wire are human organisms. They don't deserve rights. A foetus is like those skin cells, but with a primitive brain. What about tumours then? Shouldn't they have rights under your blanket definition of what deserves personhood? They are human organisms. Oh and by the way, the only difference between a baby borned on the first day and the baby about to be born is one is out of the womb and one is in, which is the only difference but a baby born already also does not have personhood. Right, however for convenience we grant a born infant rights while we grant a foetus no rights. If you want rights, be born. I have a question for you: how is one supposed to be able to experiment on human systems if foetuses are granted human rights? Foetuses are presently unpeople, our only way to experiment on something that is human but not a person. What should we use then if foetuses become illegal for this? What if I wish to test the development of a human brain? A foetus has a developing brain but it isn't self aware. So now I can't use it? You are really damning a lot of interesting scientific opportunities.	0

Industrial hemp it is THC free (less than 0.2% of THC, limit set by law). I've grew up near a huge field of that. Dealers would not disappear , their numbers would increase, dealers would be always cheaper (no taxes at all) and after legalization, possession would not be crime anymore so there will be no way how to get rid of dealers. Also for example Taliban is the biggest producer of Marijuana on the world, would you like to legalize their income? Medical use of Marijuana... it's a mild painkiller, nothing special also nothing healthy, no need for it.

The indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole. Dumbed down it means how things follow each other.

"But C didn't exist in any metaphysical state until you made C exist, which puts it into the past immediately. You don't have any kind of future there, you just have a more recent past compared to B. The Dinosaurs died out after the Earth was created, it doesn't make the extinction of dinosaurs the future. Now if you wish to make the future contingent on a point of reference (IE, the dinosaur extinction is the future in reference to the Earth's creation), how is that not making it a subjective fact? While the event still happens in the same order if no-one categorises it, it takes us to observe and reference the event to categorise it, making it subjective by default. Stars would be in the sky if we weren't here (well, not necessarily, but an axiom for this debate), but they wouldn't be ""future"" stars or whatever unless we categorise them; they would just be different points of the past. I also disagree on a syntactic level. Saying ""The dinosaur's extinction was the future in reference to the Earth's creation"" makes no logical sense to me. It's not the downfall of the argument, but something I find a little absurd."	0
When you look at the attitudes of the southern people toward slavery you would see that they didn't like it very much at all but since they had no other way of harvesting enough Cotten to make an actual profit they allowed it to continue. Hears some more, facts the Ku Klux Klan formed as an anti UNION/vigilante para-military organization, the Jim Crow and black code laws were passed as a way to spite the north since they couldn't do so directly.

But they are dead. If you cut them to pieces, they will not feel it. If you insult them, they will shed no tears - they are without life. Without life means they have no feelings, no sentience.

What? Save the people. Why would you choose one child over an entire train full of people?

This is silly...humans are a completely different race of creatures from other animals. Other animals don't bother including humans into their societies, so on the level you mentioned, as far as having animals paying taxes, we're obviously not equal. Also, humans are hundreds of times smarter than almost all animals. We've evolved much further than they have, so we're obviously not equals. I do believe, in the spiritual sense, as in we can all live together in harmony, that we are equal. But that is all.	How much more equal would you say they are? How many lives of a dog are equal to a humans?	0
"In fact Judaism doesn't believe in the Jewish savior at all. Actually they believe in the Messiah.   I'm sorry Srom.

I don't think that it's good because it allows you to argue with people without ever seeing them. It allows you to objectify and deamonize your opponents to the point where you can't recognize their humanity. Don't get me wrong I enjoy this site, and I have actually come to know some of the users here (albeit in a very limited way) so that I know a little bit more about them, but when all you know about people is their opinion on a few issues, it becomes way too easy to stereotype and over simplify people's lives. You assume that you know more than them, and your self-righteousness probably gets worse. I know that whenever I have discussions with my friends about current issues, I act very differently then I do on this site.	I sort of agree with all that you said. I think this distance and anonymity we have makes it so that its easier to take a strong stance, and demonize, steriotypicalize (is that a word ;) and etc. But pollsters say that its easier to get honest responses out of people who have a certain distance to what is being questioned. Also I do think that it can be helpfull to bring out into the open our strong opinions (prejudices);to went out so to speak and get feedback and not keep things bottled up and I think this site can sort of work as a peer-2-peer psychology sessions for that. I don't think that needs to be bad even though ego´s get bruised and big words get thrown once in a while - but then I'm sitting on the fence a little bit on this issue precisely because of what you said: I do say things here I most likely wouldn't say in a group of friends. This site also gives us a chance to talk to people and get opinions you would never get in your own group of friends I also think that this sort of dynamic message board tech can be fused with the democratic process alot more than has been tried or tested, and am all for that.	0
I reject your statement with this note. Apes are their own species inside the hominidae family. We did not evolve from apes we evolved from a different species that grandfathered the current primate species that we have today. Humans did not evolve from apes. Apes being the key word there. we descended from an ancient being that would classify as a member of the hominidae family. However, apes are a separate evolutionary track then human. The differences between human and ape are huge as well as their similarities.	ahem..http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape It is a clade, a group, not a species. And humans are part of that group. Saying a human is not an ape is a bit like saying a cat isn't a feline. But, feel free to tell me what the scientific name for animals is using genus and species	0
Despite what people say in order to be perceived as politically correct, most people do no react well to diversity. People are naturally attracted to the company of those like themselves. If this is untrue then why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? I am not trying to contest that people often react poorly to diversity. I am contesting that people simply must react poorly to diversity. I believe that a refusal to accept or understand other demographics is the product of environment rather than genetics; it is learned rather than innate.  And in regard to the comment about people being attracted to those most like themselves, this is true but subjective. We are all humans and our differences are vastly overshadowed by our similarities. Diversity IS the cause of conflict if the natural human reaction to it is a negative one, and I think it obviously is. Expecting people to embrace those that are different from themselves is expecting them to go against human nature. As I stated, I believe an adverse reaction to diversity is learned after birth. However, I recognize that evidence may be contradictory on this issue. So, even if it is instinctual, humans are not slaves to their instincts; if we recognize that a behavior is counterproductive or harmful to others, we have the intelligence and self-control to identify and amend bad behavior, especially if we are taught to do so from a young age. You say that diversity can exist in the absence of conflict, but can you name a diverse community or nation that does not have conflict between it's differing races or cultures? I would like to see an example of a harmonious, multicultural society. I never claimed that intolerance towards diversity is an uncommon thing. Just because it is common does not mean it is inherent.  I posited that diversity will strengthen a community as long as no one in the community is contrary to the goal of coexistence. The larger a community is, the more likely it is that that community includes individuals who are hostile towards other demographics. Thus, a community large enough to be known to both of us is unlikely to meet these requirements. However, I think it is becoming increasingly unlikely that you will be able to locate a completely homogeneous community or nation and the strength, success, and peacableness of all these diverse populations varies immensely. I have been a part of many groups that were both diverse and harmonious. Most notably, I currently live in an apartment complex with a substantial Indian population, and I lived and intended elementary school in a neighborhood split evenly pretty between Islamic and Christian families. Less notably, I often work on group projects in college with people from different demographics. I realize that anecdotal evidence is not a strong support for an argument, but I do think that many of my experiences are reasonably common and I would hazard a guess that you have been a part of a functional group, at least once, composed of diverse demographics.	If reaction to diversity is learned after birth, then why so much racial tension? We have been steadily bombarded most of our lives with positive images of racial harmony from the news media, from Hollywood, from magazines from the advertisement and music industries. You would think we would all be one big happy melting pot by now, yet we still self-segregate.  Yes, I have had positive experiences working within a diverse group. I get along well with others and can appreciate variety, but that is simply my personal experience. I am concerned with the overall effects diversity has on society and I am referring to people in general groups. As groups, we are not getting along at all. I may have a Mexican friend but that does not mean that I think the presence of Mexican immigrants in my community somehow strengthens it.	0
accepting them Okay, so let's go with that. Say you've more or less accepted a tragedy in your life. It will still be stressful for a while afterwards, and sometimes it's okay to just...forget, is all I'm saying.	If something has been accepted it will still cause pain whenever it is reminded, but then it is easy to just ignore it. Forgetting something very tragic is nearly impossible. The brain could probably shut it out if it is tragic enough, as much as to not remember, but it could still emerge one day and then what? It's best dealt with as soon as possible, the faster you can move on with your life. There are some things I myself would very likely want to forget, but at the same time they make me who I am, so it's not even an option.	0

Mobility in a phalanx is hard to increase. I would not say mobility won out in the over all war. Also attack a country just out of civil wars is very much like kicking a cripple. He may get a lucky shot in a beat you but by all rights you should win if you plan on keeping your self respect. You don't seem to get that wars have little to do with killing. Its more to do with cost. Romans wear cheaper armor. Greek armor is literally made out of the currency. Each Greek soldier represents a massive financial commitment, so if they die it hurts your coffers while quite literally handing your money over to the enemy. What more Greece is a terrible place to grow food. . Raising the same number of troops is not the same as feeding, clothing, and housing them well. With those conditions better satisfied you have a better fighting man. The Romans geographical placement was well suited to providing them with these luxuries and that geographical placement (a large field of fertile land protected on all sides) is a large part of the secret to their success. . The Greeks on the other hand have a terrible land with little space for growing food. Only between mountains could this be done. It was also true that during their civil strife much of this limited fertile land was razed already. It was not a case of superior fighting forces if you look at it from this perspective. Its actually a victory of a stable efficient Roman government that lacked the flawed and weak semi feudal Greek system of government that was littered with administrative weakness and internal strife. Real wars are not so cut and dry as a superior fighting force winning. . To decide who is a better fighter entertainment is a better medium. Even before the Gladiators there was professional dueling in the classical world. The most famous example can be seen in the Aeronautica with the king who duels one man from each ship in a lethal boxing match. Why? Because before banks the main way one moved up the social ladder was buy defeating someone in war, or a duel and taking their stuff. You could make a lot of money very fast. . However when Romans wanted to become great fighters and live in this sort of war economy they studied in Greece, not in Rome. It was generally acknowledged that Greek martial arts where better, and the iconic upward cut to pierce armored foes that many Roman fighters loved is Greek and best shows the influence. The original Greek sword for that is much more logical, a thin fencing weapon rather than a broad Gladius which one might not expect to encourage stabbing maneuvers.	Not really, we are talking about the Macedonian wars here, the Macedonians had the most advanced phalanx of the greeks, and had hardly been to war due to previous treaties forbiding any international action. Moreover the battle of Pydna was fought on home ground with a huge numerical advantage and still lost abysmally. So in truth the best way to decide the better fighter one should objectively learn the history of the conflict, which the romans won in more than 1 war	0
Well if you're having sex with new partners every weekend, that's obviously just for the lust. Is that right? I don't think it is. Lust is a horrible thing, and can lead people to do horrible acts, and make bad decisions. Also, there's the chance that you can impregnate multiple people. I'm not saying that these children aren't equally as important as any other child on the planet, but is it really fair for them to be born into the world when there's not the real love between two people? Accidental pregnancy's can lead to skewed lives for children, as the parents might not have the basic relationship beforehand to sustain them. I'm not saying it's the biggest deal ever, but if you think of sex as nothing, then before you know it, we'll be breeding like rabbits.	We are obviously already breeding like rabbits.

How it that outrageous? Of course, a theme park is a little more expense than a leisure park because of operating and equipment costs. Therefore, it would be cheaper for entry with leisure parks, and if it makes you feel better, the government could set ordinances or laws setting a price floor. This practice is done with housing in urban areas. What about those people who are forced into paying more taxes in order to fund government parks who otherwise never go to the parks? Is that fair?  Why segregate parks? Theme parks are private, but leisure parks must be public. Where is the logic?	How it that outrageous? How isn't it? A bottled water from a store is about $1.39. $3.75-$1.39=$2.36 extra going into the pockets of private owners. the government could set ordinances or laws setting a price floor. Oh, but that's a regulation. People like you can't stand regulations until it helps you out. What about those people who are forced into paying more taxes in order to fund government parks who otherwise never go to the parks? That's not my problem. The parks are there for them if they choose to use it. If a city spends $100,000 on upkeep of a park per year for a city of 50,000 people, then that's only $2 per person per year, where as a private park would be probably about $2 per person per visit. If a parent takes their child to the park every week, then it would be about $208 per year. Theme parks are private, but leisure parks must be public. Where is the logic?  Nowhere does it say that leisure parks must be public.	0
There have actually been scientific studies that have supported the idea that humans are actually polygamous. Throughout most of history they have been. The most powerful guy in the village would have more wives because he would make a better provider.

The technique is extremely risky right now. A particular worry is the possibility that the genetic material used from the adult will continue to age so that the genes in a new-born baby clone could be - say - 30 years old or more on the day of birth. Many attempts at animal cloning produced disfigured monsters with severe abnormalities. So that would mean creating cloned embryos, implanting them and destroying (presumably) those that look imperfect as they grow in the womb.	Paster, victims is necessary for humanity to move forward in the science and achieve high results in the future. Now cloning can be abnormal, but in the future it will become something like an everyday occurrence.	0

This is a very simple issue in my opinion. When evaluating ethical issues that impact many people (thousands or millions), I find it most useful to construct and consult a simple pleasure calculus found in the ethical theory of Act Utilitarianism, a deontological ethical argument which proposes that, in specific situations, one should do that which results in the greatest amount of pleasure.  So, regarding drug-testing on animals, the answer is quite simple. Say we get a unit of happiness for everyone ever positively effected by discovers in medicine that directly resulted from testing the medications on animals; these will include all the millions of people saved by cancer treatments, antidepressants, etc., and their nearest and dearest -- many millions. Then take the few thousand who are empathic towards the animals subjected to testing and subtract one unit of pleasure from the total. NET PLEASURE = MANY MILLIONS Verdict: continue animal testing at all costs!	Of course it seems very simple to talk about this issue, but what's about animals' lives? Why don't people feel sorry for them. They are alive and have rights to live. When scientists make different experiments, animals feel pain, and even can't tell about it. Why not to find another way of testing drugs?	0

Given the extensive history of discrimination against atheists by theists, is it really all that unreasonable to object to being wished a Happy Holiday or Merry Christmas? Whatever the intention, the act of wishing someone good will by way of the very institutionalized religion(s) that have oppressed them is insensitive and ignorant at best. It would not be unlike wishing a woman a happy patriarchy day or a racial minority a happy white day.  Further, religious minorities can increasingly expect and openly demand greater sensitivity and inclusion. I fail to see why it is so unreasonable for non-theists to demand that exact same thing and become upset when they are not only denied inclusion but told to shut up and stop complaining.  Certainly there are bigger battles to fight, but it is fallacious to imply that this issue is unimportant by comparison and unworthy of a strong stance. There will always be a bigger battle to fight, but that does not mean apathy and neutrality are warranted for every smaller issue.	"It would not be unlike wishing a woman a happy patriarchy day or a racial minority a happy white day.  Except that those other minorities are obvious by observing. You can't really tell an atheist by sight. I think a much better comparison, one that actually employs a real holiday, would be saying Happy Valentines Day to strangers who might be single or freshly broken up and still hurting over it. Even then, being a jerk when someone is trying to spread cheer is still being a jerk, regardless if the accidentally hit a sensitive nerve. They don't have control over how sensitive you are, you do.  Also, in its modern iteration Christmas has extended beyond being just a religious celebration. Sure, it can be argued that its transformation into such a materialistic holiday is no better, and I do agree. But its also a time of gathering, a time of wonder for small children. A chance to push aside SAD and the inconvenience of winter cold for a day and just be happy. Why not just accept that? And what, exactly is your problem with ""Happy Holidays""? That is a concession made to regognize that not everyone is Christian. The Holiday Season starts with Thanksgiving and ends with New Years, both of which are secular. It seems to me like you are just going out of your way to be offended. What is the point in that?"	0

Besides a few battles, the French just used the war as an opportunity to raid the British navy (mainly its merchant fleet) while the British Empire tried to put down a revolution in America and take over Dutch colonies in West Africa.	Maybe so, but they were still vital in our victory. Many cities have a Lafayette street for a good reason. For that matter, they don't deserve their rep from WW2 either- given the difficulty the Allies had in WW2, The level of resistance France put up by itself is rather astonishing, not pathetic. And the fact that the French Resistance provided vital support and intelligence throughout the war is often overlooked too. We Americans owe France a far greater debt than we do China.

"The common justification is from the ""argument from ignorance"" which the common phrase is ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."""	No, in this case the absence of evidence IS evidence of absence. It's similar to when you look in your pockets for change and find none, this absence of evidence is evidence of absence.  Why don't you take this position with fairies, dragons, the loch ness monster, bigfoot, unicorns, or werewolves? After all, there is little to no evidence for those things as well.

From what I've read it is my understanding that all three conditions have to be met for ALL three conditions and not just one.

Once again... it is not completely morally based... I mean for something to be considered obscene it has to show genitals, sexual intercourse, or excretory functions ... that isn't morally based... that is all objective and since something has to do that to become deemed obscene there is a protection from a particular message being biased against.	0
For me the thing so wrong about being gay is the involvement with a penis that isn't my own.	Your mom was involved with a penis that wasn't your own... probably. Do you see the problem? Or maybe you mean that it's only okay to be gay if it is your penis the gay individual is involved in?	0

O yeah hes going awesome, driving the Federal Government into debt, releasing terrorist that will return to the battlefield and continue killing Americans, making Iraq less stable due to the insurgents now have an end game and know the time tables and can continue to hold out, as in Mosul. Showing the world what our CIA does, why not just train al Qaeda as well. Destroying National Security. Yeah hes doing amazing, F-.	don't give them time tables because that will only make them stop terrorizing until that date giving us a chance to build up the iraqi army and police, let the citizens build stability which increases public opposition to the insurgency, all while incurring fewer casualties - where do we sign?	0
"The only explanation for the rampant and completely baseless hatred the right has for this president is the color of his skin. That's just how it is. Name a white president accused of not being an American citizen... Pulling the race card. The right has gone after every left-wing president and the left has gone after every right-wing president, and now that the right doesn't like a president that is to the far left, its his skin? Seriously? That's a bit childish.  Yeah, when he was a kid, so ""nearly spotless."" Who the fuck hasn't done those things at least a couple times. The difference is he admits it and if he were a republican you'd be like ""He's so awesome because he admits it."" I have no problem with him smoking weed and doing cocaine (as I said in my argument above, and seriously, you thought I was mad at someone for doing drugs? Me? Really?) however, he is an anti-drug president. It would have been like if Nixon smoked some weed and cocaine but still went along with his whole war on drugs. Actually, there are several sources to confirm this, but this one group almost slipped a sugar cube of acid in Nixon's drink... damn I wish that had happened. If you don't acknowledge the difficulties we put in place historically for minorities and for women, then it is easily forgotten. After slavery I think it should be acceptable to acknowledge the election of a black president as advancement. Slavery was abolished over 1865, the Jim Crow laws ended in sometime in the 60's, don't remember the exact date. Just because minorities were once slaves/oppressed does not mean they deserve special treatment. Being a certain race doesn't make your accomplishments any more/less grand.  There is no equivalent anywhere. What about Hiram Revels?  Heavily supports parts of the war on drugs. You wouldn't know this obviously because right wing news sites never ever mention anything any of their libertarian constituency may like about their nemesis Actually, many Libertarians give Obama credit for supporting gay marriage.  And the fact is he's done an incredible amount, and like it or not, the Affordable Care Act is going to be considered a huge success over time as it will allow more people to live longer and happier lives, bring down costs to individuals, and drastically bring down the cost to our country in terms of percent of GDP spent on health care. Well, its kind of playing a game of pin the tale on the donkey, except its pin the the bill on the rich. We already have a major deficit, we shouldn't be adding anything to the budget until it is balanced. I know where this going ""tax the rich! tax the rich!"" well, you can go ahead. Let me just remind you, this isn't the post-WWII decades where every other country is either destroyed, communist or both. All of these countries have rebuilt and China, India and Russia have become free market, when you start treating the investors and big business like shit, guess what they are going to do? Yes that's right, out source, so then all that capital and jobs leaves and goes to a competitor.  That's just a fact. There's no country ever in history which has not seen more success with similar laws. It's going to happen, complain about reality till your face is blue. We don't need economic illiterates telling people what is and isn't fact."	"Pulling the race card. The right has gone after every left-wing president and the left has gone after every right-wing president, and now that the right doesn't like a president that is to the far left, its his skin? Seriously? That's a bit childish. False equivalency. The right goes after the left for things like having sex and being born in Kenya. The left goes after the right for things like lying about WMDs to start a war. And it is a different tone with Obama. No one on the right questioned the citizenship of Clinton, as much as they hated him, nor Jimmy Carter or any other democratic leader at any level. That he looks different allows them the capacity to take that particular angle. That angle would not work if he ""looked like"" rural America.  Now, hopefully that small group consists only of Trump and 10% of the right, but I think it is wishful thinking, the assumption it is a coincidence this happens to be the first black president and he happens to be the first attacked in this particular manner. And the right would do themselves a whole lot of good if instead of letting this type of thing go on to keep that constituency happy, they instead did what McCain did in the 08 election when the crazy lady with the crazy hair said Obama wasn't a citizen in the debates. Slavery was abolished over 1865, the Jim Crow laws ended in sometime in the 60's, don't remember the exact date. Just because minorities were once slaves/oppressed does not mean they deserve special treatment. Being a certain race doesn't make your accomplishments any more/less grand. I don't consider acknowledgement of a historical landmark ""special treatment."" Whether it is embarrassing that it took until 2008 for a black person to be seriously considered for the presidency, or a milestone, is debatable. It is one though, and that can be separated from consideration over his effectiveness I believe. What about Hiram Revels? Excellent point! <a href='http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/01/parallels-to-countrys-racist-past-haunt-age-of-obama/'>http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/01/parallels-to-countrys-racist-past-haunt-                                       age-of-obama/  The first black senator did receive similar attacks. That more supports my and most people's theory that the ""he's not American, not like us, different, etc"" stems not from politics but from race though. Actually, many Libertarians give Obama credit for supporting gay marriage. You missed the point by quoting a portion. His leniency on marijuana was the point, and the secondary point is that portion is not covered in right media. The libertarians whose philosophies of freedom extend to gays is not a large portion of that segment of the right wing for some reason, but any ""credit"" they may give Obama I've not heard. Usually the subject is changed to the right of marriage in general, thus not supporting gay marriage by saying they don't support marriage, yet not accepting the reality that marriage exists and it is currently unequal. Well, its kind of playing a game of pin the tale on the donkey, except its pin the the bill on the rich. We already have a major deficit, we shouldn't be adding anything to the budget until it is balanced. I know where this going ""tax the rich! tax the rich!"" well, you can go ahead.

Yes that's right, out source, so then all that capital and jobs leaves and goes to a competitor. More false premises. 1. We have one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the world. Closing loopholes and raising taxes the suggested 3% would not change this. 2. Fine, leave. Find quality labor in another country if you think you can. Spend the extra X on shipping to the U.S. instead of making things locally. News flash, Atlas Shrugs is utter bullshit. Any company that leaves there are 10 that are happy to take its place. The U.S. is the best place in the world to be in business unless you want to run a sweat shop, and I don't want any sweat shops in America. And none of that has anything to do with the Affordable Care Act anyway. Insuring more people means less people waiting until they are dying to see a doctor. Treating people before they are almost dead is way cheaper. It saves money for rich people, poor people, and everyone in between. More important it saves more lives. The only people who have a legitimate reason, one based in reality and not fantasy, to not like the bill are insurance companies. Insurance companies are a huge part of the problem though, so fuck them. They've driven up costs to more than double per capita what any other country pays and they work harder to not cover the ill than they do to find treatment. Why would anyone care if they lose a couple million of their billions because they can't rip people off any more?"	0
"Regardless if you've been ""casually cruel"" your whole life, means very little to do with him being human, and you being human; the potentiality we all hold as humans, a destructive yet beauty species.  No, it's pretty obvious I wouldn't say the same if he shot another human. (I've written countless posts pertaining to how I generally feel about human to human encounters; via justice and the death penalty, cop to civilian, ect.)   The guy did not shoot another human. The difference is huge in my opinion. Animal to animal, sure, I'd say it's a fair assessment, however to say human to human that's a big difference. Humans have more choices they make in life and are more ""aware"" of the situation. Proof? A horse is strong enough to get away from a man that is holding a leash and it didn't flee because it had a previous relationship with the human; the human fed it, took care of it, made sure it was fairly healthy enough to be kept around long enough before being shot in the head by its assumed owner.  If the horse was anything like a human, it wouldn't be sitting there calm, relaxed and without a fight. The horse stood their, without even knowing what the guy was preparing to do to it, nor with what ""weapon"". A horse does not understand what a weapon is. A horse perhaps can calculate visually what might hurt it. Do you see the difference?  I understand the whole, ""life is life is life"" ordeal, and the beauty of animals and mother nature. However, there is obviously a reason other animals, non humans, were put onto this earth.  And it's pretty obvious humans are omnivores, that is they both survive upon consuming meat and protein and vegetables/fruit, ect. So the fact that humans have been alive and the top of the food chain for a particular amount of time, tells me this is evidence to prove that animals were put onto this earth by mother nature herself, to benefit the human being in nutrition, comfort, and overall well being."	So you've been taken care of by a more intelligent species all your life. One of them leads you away from where you are kept, which is not unusual. Why would you be suspicious? Why would you be suspiciouswhen they take out an unknown object and point it at you? I mean, a horse's idea of a predator leaps at you with fangs and claws, right? This does not mean that the horse is any less sentient than we are. They weren't 'put' on the planet, they strived to survive like us.	0

"They've done some very odd analyses, and as it turns out, there should be anywhere from 10 to 1 million ""advanced"" civilizations in the universe at any given time, but that says nothing about less advanced lifeforms. And it is very unlikely that aliens have visited, because although we may seem primitive to them, there is fair reason to fear that if we do not kill ourselves, we may become advanced enough to destroy them, so they'd want to get rid of us NOW, while we are not as powerful. Since we're not under invasion, aliens don't know we're out there."	"They've done some very odd analyses, and as it turns out, there should be anywhere from 10 to 1 million ""advanced"" civilizations in the universe at any given time And yet it is all conjecture. There is not even proof that a single 'civilization' exists aside from Humanity (if we can even be called a 'civilization'). And it is very unlikely that aliens have visited, If they exist, then why not? Isn't there quite a bit of evidence to suggest that - if the do exist - they have visited? because although we may seem primitive to them, Why would we seem 'primitive' to them? there is fair reason to fear that if we do not kill ourselves ""If we do not kill ourselves""? I believe it to be a matter of 'when', not 'if'. we may become advanced enough to destroy them If we can destroy ourselves now, then why are we not currently 'advanced' enough to destroy them? so they'd want to get rid of us NOW, while we are not as powerful. Why do humans believe that everything unknown is a threat? Androids, aliens, etc. Since we're not under invasion, aliens don't know we're out there.

1st point-I think your missing the point, those examples you listed are exceptions to the rule.  2nd point-Not everyone CHOOSES to have a child sometimes accidents happen and whether a couple is ready to have a child or not doesn't matter.  3rd-Your young now but I'm sure when your older you'll want your children to come and visit you and take you places that you wouldn't normally be able to go. There's nothing worse than spending your elderly years alone, think about that before you reply.	If there are exceptions you cannot make it a universal rule. I don't think I'm missing the point, because the fact is that there are some bad parents out there. I thought this debate was about whether or not children should look after their elderly parents. If this debate is about whether or not some children should look after their elderly parents if they were really good parents (which is subjective), I would still disagree. All parents do have a choice in having a child. Even if they accidentally get pregnant, they can choose to give up their child for adoption to parents who want them. They do make the choice to have and raise children, unless someone is holding a gun to their head. I don't want to have children. However if I did, I would want to be the best parent possible because children can't choose who their parents are. If I had kids I would want to have a great relationship with them, so I would try my hardest to be a loving and positive influence in their lives. If they chose not to see me when I was old, I would not resent them for it. I would not expect them to take care of me just because I gave birth to them. I would wonder what it was I did wrong, that they didn't want to see me.	0
How does change help society when it was apparently working before? The history of modernity is itself the story of the constant victory of liberalism over conservatism. Almost everything you now take for granted in a modern society is directly or indirectly a consequence of liberalism. In fact, the criteria for a modern society is based largely on how much it has been socially and politically liberalized.	What do I take for granted that is directly or indirectly a consequence of liberalism? Constant victory of liberalism over conservatism only because they are more liberals than conservatives.

"We didn't invent ""time"" any more than we invented ""space"". Sure, one can argue that we invented the second, or the day, or the year; just like we invented the yard and the mile...but these divisions were meant to keep order and help us measure things. The fact that certain process happen naturally within select periods of time is proof of the passage of time, and that was happening long before (before being another measurement of time) we came along. More importantly, if something can be manipulated, it is real. If some selected process happened with the exact same passage of time everywhere in the universe, we could potentially argue that time was purely invented. But both mass and speed of movement can change the flow of time for an object or in a region of space. If a second moves more slowly near a major gravity field (and we now know for a fact that it does), then we know a second has actual substance and isn't just an arbitrary concept. Plus, there is a strong possibility that time may flow backwards in certain conditions, something that wouldn't happen if it was imaginary."	"You talk of these things as if it's absolute but you fail to take in consideration how you can only go by you're mere senses when talking about something. They're all you have. Some things, are beyond human senses and for most, understanding. You will continue to talk about the passing of ""moments"" as being time flowing but again this is simply how your mind has grasped a phenomena. Not the absolute reality."	0

Nazis believe the Holocaust was just, you believe damnation of the Jews is just. Nazies believed in eugenics. They believed in the end justifying the means, to create an all-powerful Arian race.

A criminal punished for the extent of his crimes. If you believe that a petty thief deserves to go to the same place as a mass murderer then I don't know what to tell you. As for your rebuttal to my argument, pathetic. You did not disprove my logic, what the basis for their actions were is irrelevant. You must believe that the Nazi's treatment of the Jews was just if you are willing to advocate a worse punishment	0
your mother was probably looking out for you. although nothing very serious ever happens by it. except you might get cramps or stuff like that. so you can go swimming and MIGHT have to go through the cramps part. although it doesn't happen to everybody necessarily.  it's like exercising after lunch. similar to it anyway.	Swimming after eating wont give you cramps, if you're a guy. Cramps are a symptom of menstruation, men don't menstruate. Unless you meant that swimming after eating changes men into women. Swimming doesn't do that; unless you swim to Thailand.  I always thought it was funny that Thailand has so many lady boys, because it sounds like tie-land, like a men's clothing item. Not that girls can't wear ties. Like as part of a Catholic school girl uniform. I once knew a girl who wore one of those, it was really sexy. Don't worry she wasn't a student she was a stripper. Well, I guess she was a student, in that, she was only stripping to put herself through nursing school.  I thought it was weird she wore a catholic school uniform instead of a nurses uniform. And not because she was studying to be a nurse, but because she was a Baptist.	0
"No it just means ""I don't know"" nothing wrong with that, I am a scientist in my own right and I will tell you first hand, science can not prove nor disprove God, what I can say with 99.999% certainty is that the religious version of God is bull shit, but not the existence of a creator. To be an agnostic is to be scientific until you are proved otherwise, I am agnostic on the subjects of dark matter, dark energy ect. even though all signs point to yes, but until we have 100% proof like we do gravity I will remain agnostic on those matters as well as a creator, (God, Allah or what ever one may call it)"	"The point I am making is that nobody knows everybody is agnostic but that is not interesting. Once you are agnostic you have not answered the theological question. You are not being asked to know if there is a God or not, we know you can't know that you're being asked do you believe in God? If you are Agnostic enough to not know what you believe is you are still an Atheist because according to the definition of believe it means ""to feel sure of the truth"" therefor belief must be an active thing, that you have to actively believe in something. So by definition if you don't know that there is a God than you don't believe that there is a God. Theologically Agnosticism is not accurate and neither is Apatheism because neither deal with with belief."	0

"So, when a small business fails, what does the government? Oh, who gives fuck, you nobody? Basically. That IS what you advocate. Nobody lets companies grow so big, they grow big due to demand and government helps them go bigger by regulations. Big businesses form naturally from an unregulated market and unregulated business practices. They secure their assets by buying political favours. So it is a natural consequence of free market and lack of regulations that increasing regulations will emerge as businesses start to play politics for their favour. Soon we have laws like ""margarine must be died pink"" or ""copying movies is highly illegal"" that stem from decades of power struggles."	Basically. That IS what you advocate. I have never advocated big business, that is your perceptive. Big businesses form naturally from an unregulated market and unregulated business practices.  Big business forms due to demand. Business operates as a voluntarily exchange between two parties of good and services. McDonalds or Ford has every forced me into a exchange of their goods or services. They grew out of the demand by consumers and lack of multiple competitors. The entity that forces into service is the government, and if I don't pay for their services, I go to jail. They secure their assets by buying political favours. it is a natural consequence of free market and lack of regulations that increasing regulations will emerge as businesses start to play politics for their favour. Wrong, that is consequence of big business and big government working in collusion.	0
Havent you ever heard of occams razor? Pascals wager? If god DOES exist, and you dont believe in him, you are losing EVERYTHING, but if he doesnt and you still believe in him you lose nothing, that to me is illogical thinking, how do you explain HOW the big bang came into existence? How ALL the materials came into existence? Its just deductive reasoning, and to be honest, believing god doesnt exist is more wishful thinking than believing god exists	Pascals wager?  I highly doubt that it didn't occur to a man as intelligent as Blaise Pascal that an omniscient God wouldn't see through feigned belief, Pascal's wager is a ridiculous argument, that when taken seriously regards God as a fool.  Ever heard of the Atheists' wager? You should live your life and try to make the world a better place for your being in it, whether or not you believe in god. If there is no god, you have lost nothing and will be remembered fondly by those you left behind. If there is a benevolent god, he will judge you on your merits and not just on whether or not you believed in him <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist's_Wager'>Source Occam's Razor, does not work for you either, a God/Primer mover is infinitely more complex than anything in existence, we need to make serious leaps of faith based on no quantifiable data in order to invoke God as the creator of the universe, so who is making the most assumptions? HOW the big bang came into existence? Certainly not by making up something. How ALL the materials came into existence? Materials, as in matter? it comes from quantum foam fluctuations all the time. Its just deductive reasoning No, it's begging the question, and it's creating an infinite regress. and to be honest, believing god doesnt exist is more wishful thinking than believing god exists So, believing in an omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent, omnipresent, mind invading, Universe-creating, worship loving, charred livestock smelling, shave hating, shellfish avoiding, homophobic, filicidal, ethnic cleansing, logical contradiction is not wishful thinking?

"Because you're claiming that if God exists, he would HAVE TO BE a merciful, personal, caring God and therefore, an argument like ""evil coexists with God"" is merely an elementary tactic for Atheists who are afraid of reasoning. It's actually a lot more simple than some will try to make it."	"Well, that's actually not how the argument from evil goes - or at least, it's not how someone who is serious about the argument would state it. The argument doesn't run: ""If God exists, then he is omnibenevolent."" Rather, omnibenevolence is one of the characteristics that are inherent in the definition of God as used in this argument. The most basic form of this argument runs: ""If God exists and is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent, then there will be no evil. There is evil, therefore there is no God who is omni-all-of-the-above."" The argument from evil is only a workable argument against a God who is conceived as being omnibenevolent. Of course, due to the limitations of human knowledge, we cannot know whether or not God (if he exists) is omnibenevolent or not, but for the purposes of argument we assume that we can know some things about God. For the purpsoses of every argument we have to assume that we can know some things about the topic of argument, or we will never be able to say anything."	0

Although I am not convinced that Atheism is a religion, I would like to disagree with your point on Atheist's lack of faith as you define it.  The Cosmological Argument (a philosophically valid argument) states that the universe exists by conforming to one of three possible options. Either: 1.) The universe has always existed and everything is a dependant being 2.) The Universe was created by a self existent being (God) 3.) Or the Universe has no explanation (which makes no sense). So while there is no real proof to accept the existence of a Self-Existent being (aka a God), there is no reason to deny him. You can disagree with some definitions of God, like an all knowing, all loving, and all powerful God, but to DENY his existence requires some amount of belief (aka faith). If you want to deny all four of these points one would have to be Agnostic.	"1) I believe that the universe has no explanation (existential nihilism) and it makes perfect sense to me. 2) If there is no proof of a beings existence and if there is a very high chance that the being does not exist (through logical argument) then a person has every reason to deny the existence of that being.  3) You do not need faith to deny the illogical. Example: The pine cone is not a dinosaur because it is impossible for it to be a dinosaur. Not, ""I have faith that the pine cone is not a dinosaur"". See how stupid and illogical that sounds? 4) I am not Agnostic. 5) I noticed that you describe god as a him. You are acting like the very stereotypical blockhead of a christian. Why can't ""god"" be female? Or maybe no gender at all?"	0

"Well, if you said ""everything is amazing/beautiful/incredible no matter what I believe"" but I would support you more, because life is all of those things no matter how you believe it came to be. But magic has a specific connotation. It implies supernatural occurrence. Your claiming atheism is therefore more supernatural, when those of us atheists who are using science to support our claims are doing pretty much the exact opposite of citing supernatural explanations."	This has nothing to do whit what supports us. I know you have evidence supporting you, I believe those evidence. I just can't understand, why you don't just admit, that this world IS magical no matter how it was created. A scientist should know that better than anyone (if you are one) Make ONE simple little change in the history of the universe, and it would have been a LOT different. Different in a way, that there would never be life. Or something else .. you name it.	0
"It's easy for you to criticise something when you have no clue what the actual costs are. All you have to do is say ""600M! That's a big number! How outrageous is that number! It's so big!""

That does not even make sense...We are not perfect beings,we will not be perfect until we are take into God's arms once more. God made us imprefect because he sent us here to learn. If we were perfect then there would be no need for learning or to be here.	If you were a parent and give a child an AK-47 and tell him to run free and do whatever he wants, and he shoots another child without realizing the implications who do you blame? Exactly, you would blame the parent who handed the kid a fully loaded AK and told him to run free. Was that event tragic, yes. Was it preventable, yes. But what do you have to say for the poor little bugger that got shot. You can call free will whatever you want, call it a curse, call it a gift, but whatever it is, according to you, god gave it to us. God still gave this child the ability to kill and allowed the actions of one person, to destroy the innocent life of another. My question is how can you reconcile the consequences of death for the innocent child with an all loving god. How could he allow that child to die in a situation that in no way reflected a free choice of his own. How does this child learn or grow from his experience with evil?	0

However you are not taking into consideration that oil reserves will last until about 2090, that i more than enough time to change. Fusion can become practical, wind might actually work, natural gas can power homes and maybe hydrogen will power our cars.	Well, the actual quantity of fossil fuels is really unknown given the many estimates, and renewable energy was considered, but right now, my previous response stands, renewable energy is the future, but unfortunately, it is not right now, so more capital and research should be going into now driven by the market rather than government. The market will determine the next most efficient and effective use of energy.	0

You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. And they will be destroyed in time. Terrible morality. How so? You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. When a Christian, the Holy Spirit enters and gives the Christian a new nature, a nature that fights sin and death. This nature is godly and only produces good fruit. It battles our sinful nature that only produces bad fruit. We learn from our mistakes, and as Paul said in Romans 7, we hate sin, but we do it anyways. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? I am incapable of saving anyone. So, I make myself a slave to everyone, though I am not a slave to anyone, in order to win as many as possible by the grace of God being shown through my life.	"destroyed in time Yeah, 'cuz that's how you solve your problems, you destroy them. That's how you believe fellow humans should be treated. Really, if everyone lived by your ideas, all it would take would be some jackass to start the next Holocaust. ""God of forgiveness"" my ass. If a child is born and raised in the wrong family, in the wrong culture, he will send the eternity suffering. You obviously have NO FUCKING IDEA the extent of that. If you were abused, or tortured, had any sort of serious experience with suffering, you would see what is wrong with your philosophy. The fact that you are perfectly okay with knowing that BILLIONS of people (some of whom you have even met) being eternally tortured, shows that you have no compassion, no empathy. You are a soulless machine that will blindly obey his overlord, and support whatever action he takes, be it genocide, torture, torment, whatever.

While it is just a theory,there is scientific proof of evolution.

"I prefer to use the words evidence for instead of proof of but I agree with what you said.  I never understood religious people's problems with evolution either because they could so easily argue that no matter how things came to be or evolved over time- ""God"" gets the credit.

Murder: The unlawful killing of another human As we can tell, cows are not humans.	Technically speaking, humans are mammals. Mammals are a classification of animals.

A criminal cannot be rehabilitated if he/she doesn't want to change. Most do not want to change, it was their choice that landed them in jail in the first place.  Why change when the punishment is too often just a slap on the hand?	A criminal is a product of his environment, they take risks which may take years of their life or most of their property away from them for a reason. Its non-nonsensical to suggest that most criminals choose to go to jail, pay heavy fines, receive the bad name of criminal, etc  If you want to change a criminal, you give him the tools to change his environment.	0
That is not true at all, far from it, Humans by nature are a creative species without money humans will unlock there full potential and do nothing but advance humanity, give a human time to think and he of she will unlock the unknowns, history proves this, how else do you think we got this far, great minds require time to think, working to survive hinders that, we humans are meant for sooooo much more, the only thing stopping us is our brain washed condition accepting centuries of the monetary system.

I thought the very meaning of a sin was that it was wrong - you know, violating a moral code >.< But as for the medication stealing, I'd say that only the act, not the intention, was wrong.	"""sin"" means missing the mark, or more accurately not living up to the demands of some religious dogma.  You can not live up to a standard which would make you sin free, and still act ethnically or morally. Not sinning may even be consider evil, this is possible because people can use different moral codes to judge other moral codes and religious obligations. For example, a homosexual may believe that under various religious doctrines homosexual acts are sinful but may also believe that not being himself would be evil. His doctrine of sin is not identical with his moral code."	0
plastic is way lighter than paper... so you can carry more plastic bags in trucks without using too much gas (since trucks that carry a lot of weight use way more gas).	I wasn't the one who downvoted you, but I'll respond.  Admittedly paper may weigh more then plastic, and therefore produces less CO2 emissions, but there are other factors to consider. Paper for example comes from trees. Trees absorb CO2. Assuming the trees are being grown for the future use of making paper products, the the trees would more then likely absorb enough CO2 to make up for the weight difference. Also, because paper is a natural product, when it is thrown away it degrades naturally and doesn't significantly harm the ecosystem. Plastic on the other hand is not biodegradable and stays on the earth forever (see argument on other side of debate). If trees are just being cut down and not replanted the issue becomes more complicated, but in general I would still say that plastic is more harmful.	0

"How is a getting a haircut not the same as changing your gender? Haircut makes you look different with that people perceive you differently. Gender change makes you look different and perceived differently. Because your hair and your penis are two totally different things. Example: Susie gets a haircut. ""Hey Susie, nice haircut!"". Susie gets a gender change. ""Hey Susie, nice penis!""... and then of course they all carry on like it's no big deal. ""Don't worry Susie! Your vagina will grow back!"". Your hair before you decide you cut it is from when you were born (the genetics that determine how long it will get). Your gender is determined by genetics as well. Maybe parents have fond memories of their child when their hair was short but not when it was long? It's not like your hair goes from black and straight to red and curly. It grows and you get a haircut. Your penis grows in a different type of way, but when you cut it off... it doesn't grow back. Maybe parents have fond memories when their child was a nice bookworm not when they were a rockband enthusiast? people change because they feel like it and/or the situation around them makes them change. If parents can not accept the fact that people change and 'grow up' then they should not be parents should they? All of that is minor compared to a sex-change. Changing is part of life. 100 years ago, sex-change wasn't even an option."	"I like it :) now your are trying to debate with me, i applaud you for it :D  Sooooo your argument is that once you change your gender you can not change it back?your saying that the difference is that ones hair 'grows' back but penises don't?  Well, Can you not have surgery again? and then get your penis back? technically its not 'growing back' but it does come back when you have surgery after your have surgery.

You think the question that is being asked is what do you believe, correct? Not what do you know. Okay, I understand that, but Agnostic belief is that nothing is known when it comes to God. Why do you have to choose a side? Why can't you keep an open mind and accept that you don't know anything? It's almost like you are arguing that Agnosticism isn't a religion. It's not! Neither is Atheism.	Atheism is non-theism not being theistic. Agnosticism is not theistic as you are saying so. In a theological sense Agnostics should call themselves Atheists. Logically we are all Agnostic but we all have a non Agnostic theological stand point on theistic ideologies.	0
I'm for it... but we need to stay militarist. this means if a nation poses as a threat we must eliminate that threat. if it doesn't, stay back, but keep a watchful eye. genocidal maniacs... there's a lot of them, and we can't take them all out, but the genocidal maniacs make allies and enemies, and they start looking for new ways to kill their own people that could end up hurting us. we can't let this happen.	"I have to disagree. It sounds like you're in favor of the Bush Doctrine (correct me if I'm wrong) of attacking any nations that might pose a threat. This idea of being a military based society that attacks other nations out of self-interest without regard to the civilian populations is the main reason there are terrorists that hate us. If genocide is happening, get an international coalition and kill the mother fucker responsible. I think you overestimate the number of ""genocidal maniacs"" though.  Otherwise diplomacy, and working with other nations to seek peaceful solutions to problems that are not yet violent would be a great way to prevent violent conflicts in the future. This would go a long ways towards protecting our national security in the long run."	0
Why is it that you constantly fail to see the point? But confining it to lunchtime or their breaks seems overly restrictive; You pick this one line and completely blow it out of proportion. He never said anything other than people should only pray at times when it is ok to talk about sports. So, you blather on and on when you could have just said the last line.	"Not agreeing with you on everything does not mean that I fail to see the point. Is there a particular reason you're being so abrasive? I mean, are you even reading these, or are you just skimming them and knee-jerking to whatever jumps out at you? That seems like a good way to miss the point fairly frequently, as well as a way to take any given debate off on some ridiculous tangent- not that I'm at all innocent of that, mind you. I'd say you miss points at least as often as I do. Are you suggesting that the sentence ""If they want to pray at work, they can do so durning lunch or breaks. The same goes for students at school"" implied that this was just an ok time? Because it really looks to me like it's intended more as a limitation. I could be wrong there, though, I'll grant you. And you're right, I probably went on about it longer than I needed to, and I probably could have summed it up in one or two lines- certainly not JUST the last line as written, though, as it doesn't properly represent my position on the subject.

Credit cards do not represent money; they represent credit. Your ignorance of basic finance aside, your current line of inquiry is flawed. You are attempting to argue that because a physical object exists (the credit card) and its concept also exists (the credit), that therefore the concept of God means that God must exist. The latter conclusion does not at all follow from the former observation; you have demonstrated only that concepts can be actualized realities, not they must be.	Yes, and credit represents money.

I think it would just be better if we could separate the debates from the drama is all, a place where we all just chill and talk to each other, can respond to each other but more tuned for drama and chit-chat than debating, while debates are only for debates. I am not saying to try to rid this site of drama, and honestly that is not going to happen, however I kinda like the drama in the sense it allows me to really get to know people, sometimes it all gets a little bit too ridiculous, and decreases the quality of the site from distracting from it's original purpose.	0

You can recreate, imitate, and predict human emotion, and put that into algorithms which would give robots the appearance of human emotion, however, you can never truly replicate the truly human irrationality that is so widespread today.	the capacity for robots to feel and think the way we do is not necessary for them to be sentient and think complex thoughts. Just because it is different doesnt mean they are not equal in level of experience or their deserving of rights. In a way, saying that they would need to think and feel the way we do would be similar to telling someone that if they feel differently than you do about any topic then they are less deserving of rights than you. It is anthropocentric rather than dasein-centric. We ought to think of synthetic intelligence as a different kind of dasein (see Martin Heidegger's work if you are unfamiliar with the concept of Dasein)	0
And yet, is there not just as great a chance that there is but one 'civilization', if you can even call us that?

And yet, is there not just as great a chance that there is but one 'civilization', if you can even call us that? Very dubious, since it seems that life is a natural product of the universe, theory allows for it to be commonplace. However, you're right that without true observational evidence we're operating a bit blind here. I place my trust in theory, because it seems that planets far enough from their suns for liquid water aren't so rare, Gliese 581 d supports this, and we live in a vast universe where even improbable things happen in abundance.	0

"Because, the egg cell is just a cell, right. Cells are supposed to be defined by their DNA. So if you put cat DNA into a dog egg cell, the cell should grow into a cat. But it doesn't. Which means that animals are defined by more than just DNA. There has to be some other factor involved. Thus, no matter how mutated and random a DNA strand gets, as long as it's a dog, it's offspring will be dogs. Unless that other factor happens to also randomly mutate. But we can't assume that, as we don't know what that 'other factor' is. So, in the Cambrian Explosion, when there's loads of new body shapes (defined by more than just DNA), evolution claims that's caused by random mutation of DNA. But it's not. If it was, our dog-cat thing would grow into a cat. But it doesn't. So a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is a Cambrian 8-legged sea creature is not a Cambrian 6-legged sea creature.

"I agree. If you see someone who wants us to start killing people to lower the world population, just say: ""Good, Let's start with You."""	Anyone who advocates the selective killing of people to cull the herd is a sociopath. However, you must agree that we are all complicit of a sort of de facto culling of the herd via famine, disease and wars.  Let's say somehow we all just suddenly decided to get along. Everyone, everywhere, decided to be sustainable, co-operative, generous and altruistic. Would there still be enough resources for everyone? Would we generate a sustainable amount of waste?	0
Well, since it's a no net gain scenario, a morally consequentialist framework is useless. Thus, if we apply deontological or virtue ethics, the answer is clearly no. The ends are substantially the same, thus we can take the means into account. Assuming axiomatically that killing is morally wrong, the answer is no.	"Probably best not to assume that killing is axiomatically morally wrong. I'd argue that there can be no moral axioms, and thus non-consequentialist frameworks are redundant. In a no net gain scenario, (which can only ever be purely hypothetical) there is no need for moral laws. Something is not ""good"" in and of itself, but only ""good"" according to the outcomes. It is neither okay nor not okay to kill a person to save another in such a scenario because ""okay"" is meaningless in the absence of a moral framework."	0

Pro You may have pointed out some of the flaws I had made, but it seems that you do not have a strong conviction to support mixed races, you are just someone with a neutral will. I do not see any benefits being made from mixed races. No matter which races are merged in, they are inferior due to the fact they lack loyalty in their country. These men are from First-world countries, therefore they go overseas to work. If these men have opportunities to work overseas, that means that they are both rich and on a prominent position. Do you want these good men to make children with women that does not have value in position or occupation? The child is not going to belong in the fatherland that has provided all for him/her. Populations of first-world countries are decreasing due to the fact that men go overseas without making children with his own people. Everybody loves these children just because of how they were born. They are likely to escape unemployment, because many people are wanting to hire them for their education, talent, and so on. This makes the people born in unfortunate circumstances hard to find jobs. Thus the children of these people are in such fortunate state that they can evade military service and poverty. Think of all the soldiers that fought for their country. Do these children have the same loyalty as they do? Report this Argument	"I'd like to thank my opponent for his response. I will now reply to his second round. My opponent begins his round: ""You may have pointed out some of the flaws I had made, but it seems that you do not have a strong conviction to support mixed races, you are just someone with a neutral will."" I'm not the one attempting to affirm a resolution here, you are, so my position on the matter is irrelevant. I do not need to prove mixed race couples are beneficial, I simply need to show that your arguments fail to affirm the resolution. I can take a neutral position (even if it's against what I personally believe) and still do so. ""I do not see any benefits being made from mixed races. No matter which races are merged in, they are inferior due to the fact they lack loyalty in their country."" Firstly, the resolution seeks to deny the ability for mixed race marriages, therefore it is incumbent upon my opponent to show why these marriages are harmful, not why the alternative is beneficial. Secondly, my opponent needs to show why they are inferior in any way, and why loyalty to country matters and how being in a mixed race marriage in any way shows one is not loyal to their country. Furthermore, for example, the United States is not a ""white people"" country. It is a country of more than one ethnicity. One could certainly marry outside of whatever their ethnicity is, and still be extremely loyal to their country. This is true of any other country as well. ""These men are from First-world countries, therefore they go overseas to work."" Who are these men? What exactly are you talking about here? And why does it matter? ""If these men have opportunities to work overseas, that means that they are both rich and on a prominent position."" Once again, how does this pertain to the resolution? ""Do you want these good men to make children with women that does not have value in position or occupation?"" Why not? ""The child is not going to belong in the fatherland that has provided all for him/her."" The child will belong to whatever country he/she was born in, if one can say that a child ""belongs"" to any country at all. ""Populations of first-world countries are decreasing due to the fact that men go overseas without making children with his own people."" We'll need to see some data, otherwise this is just a random assertion that doesn't back up the resolution. Even if we assume this is true, it doesn't necessarily advance the resolution regardless. ""Everybody loves these children just because of how they were born. They are likely to escape unemployment, because many people are wanting to hire them for their education, talent, and so on."" We'll need to see some data for this assertion to be backed up and relevant to the resolution. ""This makes the people born in unfortunate circumstances hard to find jobs."" Being a child of a mixed race couple does not make it inherently more difficult for one to find a job. Provide some data on this please. ""Thus the children of these people are in such fortunate state that they can evade military service and poverty."" I'm not sure how this follows the assertion just before it, but it certainly doesn't advance the resolution. ""Think of all the soldiers that fought for their country. Do these children have the same loyalty as they do?"" Why wouldn't they? Ethnicity/race is not the same as nationality. Because one is of mixed ethnicity does not mean they wouldn't have the same sense of national pride as anyone else. Even if they didn't, it still wouldn't justify banning mixed-race marriages on a local or global scale. My opponent has the burden of proof in this debate to show that we should ban mixed-race marriages and to provide good justifications for doing so. So far he has not done that, he asserts that mixed race children will be unemployed and will not be loyal to their country without providing any evidence for this. I will conclude my round here and I look forward to my opponent's final round."	0

"I do not think that Puerto Rico should become a state of the United States mostly do to costs. As it is, our economy is doing horribly right now, but that's another argument. Puerto Rico, at the moment, gets food stamps, welfare, voting privileges, and many of the things we, (the US citizens) get, without having to pay taxes. Why buy the cow, when the milk is free? Another change required would be changing our flag. Each star represents a state and each stripe one of the original 13 colonies. This would cost even more money. Lastly, I believe that Puerto Rico and the United States are doing fine how they are, so why try to change things?

I'll have to disagree. Until we can create a list of of advantages attractive people have, we can never decide fully if they are the only group to get them.

All this is equally a conjecture. No, it is not. Prove for me that alien life exists. No. Then would you care to explain how the Egyptians went from an extremely primitive state to 'all of a sudden' having much knowledge on mathematics, astronomy, engineering - in some cases, even better knowledge than us? Or what about the Mesopotamians and their 'drawings' of aliens? Or what about the many thousands - or is it millions? - of 'alien abduction cases'? How about trying to explain away all those hundreds of millions of 'UFO sightings'? While you are at it, you might want to figure out how 'abductees' often have what appears to be an 'ultraviolet tattoo' of sorts (I can't recall the precise details off hand). Maybe they have technology capable of rendering useless our best weapons. And if they don't? Assume that using extremely advance methods which I cannot imagine, we are able to deduce that a certain species of orangutans will become far more intelligent than humans 30 000 years into the future. Guess what we're going to do? Eradicate them, most likely; however, that would be out of fear on our part. We wouldn't not know that they would mean us harm; we'd be letting our fear get in the way of things. It's the same situation with aliens and us. Is it, now?	All this is equally a conjecture.

1. Sorry you don't understand intended points... I can see where your confusion came from, but after I explained it you should have gotten the point by then... damn. 2. Right to vote, sure. Right to do the same as your opposite, of course. I don't really see what civil rights are being violated here... I mean, please explain how exactly the government is discriminating against women. If the media likes to portray hot women or w/e, I don't really see the discrimination. The media is a private organization that isn't even paying women less. Real discrimination would incite that one isn't receiving as good treatment as the other because they're different. 3. Thanks 4. a. A whore can be referred to anyone who has a lot of indiscriminate sex. Man or woman. Charlie Sheen is a whore. Russel Brand is a whore. In the literal sense, of course, whore is someone who fucks for money. Definitely not the same as the word nigger. Even so, I use the word nigger, cunt, whitey, spic, kike, chink, heeb, frog, flip, whop, and basically every other offensive term because it's fun. In order to be racist or sexist, you have to actually think that you're superior and that they don't deserve rights. If you like to use offensive language, that just makes you Un-PC. Hell, I don't even discriminate cause I make fun of all races and sexes and such. b. Then what the fuck do you want and what are you bitching about in the first place? What is my parade and what's against your social dignity? If it ain't porn or sexy pictures, then wtf do you have a problem with magazines? The fact that women look at me while men look at something. Maybe because women's faces are more camera family than men's faces. Are you saying that we should eliminate artistic photography just cause YOU feel that your social dignity is in jeopardy? Can't it be possible at all that women look better certain ways and men look better other ways? Do you really have to fight down all the way to the direction that someone is looking? And if it isn't about the direction that someone is looking, than wtf are you talking about? c. Pics or it didn't happen.	You really are dense.

Is convenience more important than human lives? Why is convenience so great? If you ask me, it's completely overrated. It makes us unused to working for anything, or being patient with anything.

Would you want your life to be taken away, prevented, whatever, just because it would inconvenience others or because someone decided FOR YOU that it wasn't worthwhile?

"Oh Doherty95, how many times must I tell you.  People don't rely on only faith to believe in something they cannot see. They rely on accounts, on personal experience, on ethos, on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed, people whom believe also rely on what they see every day, life; beauty; the universe. The existence of something can, and does, be used as a reason to have faith.  You're the one stuck in a primitive mindset believing ""There is no evidence"". There is evidence, for many people. And you can't see it, that's fine, there's no personal feelings. However, stop with the bullshit mindset that ""because I (you) do not believe, no one else can."" You're being unfair, like you own this place called THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Get off your high horse."	"I will let you read what the person wrote originally... I was responding to them, but I will also respond to your points. 1) People don't rely on only faith to believe in something they cannot see Why should people rely on faith at all?  2) They rely on accounts, on personal experience, on ethos, on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed If you mean accounts of the events, then they are a good thing to have, but if these accounts are contradictory then how can you trust them? (the gospels are contradictory). Also in Greek mythology there are accounts of the Gods coming down to earth from Olympus, but you wouldn't agree with these accounts. Personal experience is unreliable, people have contradictory experiences. In religious experiences most people would see the Gods they believe in. This does not mean they have not experienced something, but what I am saying is that they are unreliable. That is why scientists use equipment because while our senses are good they are not the most reliable tools to determine what is true about the world. 3) on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed I agree, people should want to know more then what they are told,but this doesn't justify a belief in any part. 4) people whom believe also rely on what they see every day, life; beauty; the universe. I've heard you say this before but never say give examples. I do not know how beauty can be used to justify a belief or the Universe because the universe covers pretty much everything.  5) You're the one stuck in a primitive mindset believing ""There is no evidence"". There is evidence, for many people. Calling my mindset primitive does not do anything for your argument. There is a difference between someone claiming evidence and there being evidence, correct? If someone gives a list of what they call evidence it should be scrutinised to see if this evidence actually holds up, correct? If what they call evidence does not hold up to scrutiny is it still evidence?  6) And you can't see it, that's fine, there's no personal feelings. However, stop with the bullshit mindset that ""because I (you) do not believe, no one else can.""  People can believe what ever they want. If someone wants to believe the earth is flat they can, it is wrong, but they can still believe it. People have the right to believe what they want, I don't disagree with that, but just because people believe something does not mean it shouldn't be questioned, I hope you agree. 7) You're being unfair, like you own this place called THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Get off your high horse. If this is just because you think that I think that no one is allowed to believe something, then hopefully I have already answered that. 8)  All I am doing is questioning your points and why i disagree with them. If you disagree with me respond to my objections to your points."	0
I appreciate your distinction, however your example does not actually support viewing atheism as a religion or belief structure comparable to theism. In a court of law the burden of evidence is upon the prosecution to prove their claim of guilt. The defendant does not have to prove their innocence (only that there is not evidence to support the claim) because the burden of proving a counter-claim to something which may not exist is considered an irrational burden. Pursuing your analogy then, atheism does not need to prove that god does not exist but rather that there is not adequate reason to believe in the claim that god does exist.

"TIS FAMOUS QUOTE IS SAID BY MAHATMA GANDHI .... Answers: An eye for an eye refers to vengence, and it's reference is loosely taken from the Bible, you take my eye, I'll take your eye, you take my tooth, you get the picture. While people use this as justification for vengence, scripture teaches vengence is Mine referring to the Lord, but that's another question.  When Ghandi said this he was living in a very vengeful, hate filled troubled time and he was trying to focus people in a different direction. One of the ways he did that was to point out the irony of the mentality that thinks first of vengence and not of forgiveness.  If every body gets even, after a while there won't be any one.  If we all take an eye for every eye we lose, pretty soon we can't see at all.  Vengence makes losers of us all if everyone exacts revenge for a wrong done to them, then the whole world will be bent on destrying each other.  In Biblical reference:  A man (either accidentally or intentionally) blinds his neighbor in one eye. The neighbors family has the right to blind the offender in one eye as retribution. If it happens again, the original culprit is completely blind. It's a never-ending cycle. Kind of a ""catch 22"" punishment. ""An eye for an eye"" was an old saying, which was meaning if someone gave you an injury then it was ok to injure them back. Gandhi wanted to express how this revenge excuse would only lead the community to wounding each other until everyone was wounded. It means that if we each respond to violence with equal or more violence there are no winners. You poke my eye out, I poke out yours, we are both now blind. Gandhi has always been a ""turn the other cheek"" person."	what happened to Gandhi killer even he was hanged ,is this not a case of an eye for an eye.........	0
Sure it can. It's basically taking the easy way out. It's not always cowardly, I mean if a person is suffering pain that can't be described and they put up with it for a year, and tried every cure with no avail, then they are as brave as any man can be and have earned the right to die with out being labeled a coward. It can be cowardly though because you are giving in to whatever ails you, and leaving your family to suffer in your wake.	"At the same time, suicide is almost inherently a consequence of severe and chronic depression. This mental illness actually affects one's brain chemistry and structure in marked ways, altering one's perception of reality and self. In a very real sense, taking one's life may often not even be a choice in the sense that we typically understand the word.  I think that the individual who gives up without trying to fight their depression is the exception rather than the rule, and that their doing so is most likely a consequence of their not having any support network or access to mental health care treatment. Suicide is not an easy choice nor an ""easy way out"". For those who take their lives it is seen as the only course of action left to them and is generally done after considerable turmoil and an extended period of suicidal ideation. It is not a matter of courage or bravery but of endurance, and I would contend not only that every person has their limits but that those who call suicide cowardly would be hard pressed to endure the pain and suffering the precedes suicide should they have the misfortune to encounter it themselves."	0

It works. What do you think is happening in the EU and Japan? Proof that it works. True they are in a period of retrenchment, but no one wants to get rid of it. And these countries, after the United States are among the most vibrant economies in the world. It's not socialism: it's a mixed market system.	Just look at the tax base of most of the EU and tell me they aren't socialist. I mean, christ, in France its nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get fired, thanks to the social safety net. Also, the Euro experiences growth rates about 1% under the US. They don't grow as fast as we do here. And it's mainly due to their tax system. Just look at how taxes are done in the UK and tell me there's some semblance of spending control or logic. A big part of that has to do with their spending on medical care for the country. Listen, this is what's going to happen (you can quote me on it) as governments get less revenue and medical care costs move higher (thanks to an aging population and a slowdown in population growth) the government will have to either tax more or eliminate benefits.

I don't think that's correct. I think the term god is just a blanket name for higher powered being in general.

No, but sponges and some plants can. Can we mature, and reproduce all within half an hour? No, but Escherichia coli can. Can we live in a nuclear reactor?

"I didn't specify necessarily two. Considering, however, the multiple hot spots around the world at the moment, we see MAD coming up on the horizon. If Iran acquires nuclear technology to make a bomb. If China decides to be pushier and more aggressive. If North Korea invaded South Korea. If Pakistan falls to the Taliban or Al-Qaeda. Effectually the world is divided up into competing nations, each trying to become more powerful than the next. ""We've been going like this for about 5000 years, so I don't think it'll come to that."" Age does not necessarily define efficiency, let alone stability."	Considering, however, the multiple hot spots around the world at the moment, we see MAD coming up on the horizon.  I'd say that this is the most stable period since the invention of nuclear weapons. Arsenals are reducing, relations improving (between nuclear countries). If Iran acquires nuclear technology to make a bomb. If China decides to be pushier and more aggressive. If North Korea invaded South Korea. If Pakistan falls to the Taliban or Al-Qaeda. If what you say occurs, be assured that it will never go nuclear. MAD is a preventative, not an agitator.  Effectually the world is divided up into competing nations, each trying to become more powerful than the next. It has always been thus. That is who we are. Age does not necessarily define efficiency, let alone stability. Efficiency, no. Stability, debatable. If something works for 5000 years without catastrophic failure, I'd call it fairly stable.	0

A firmament never existed at any time. Light cannot come before the sun. A God didnt poof the world into existence. 2 people didnt give birth to the entire lineage of the human race. The world was never flooded. THeres no evidence for a god poofing anything into existence ever. A pile of dirt cannot form into a man nor the ingredients in dirt. Likewise woman cannot come from 1 rib bone. Evolution does not in any way corrolate with genesis nor does the big bang. You made that up and are wrong.	you're taking a fairly rigid literal interpretation aren't you? isn't it a little bit of a double standard to condemn a belief based on its literal interpretation then refer only to that same interpretation when someone attempts to offer an alternative?	0

If you get a degree online, you don't get the experience you do when you actually go to college, the hand-on-hand stuff. You can read all you want about drawing a blood sample, but once you go to do it, it's more than just a picture on a screen. To pass the course you still have to pass the hands on portions of the exams. If I want to become an EMS I would have to go out and do some test runs, pass all the physical tests ( I.E. stabilizing someone ), and pass the written tests.	True, but how many people would pass those courses if they do not have the hands on experience? Learning something and doing something is two different aspects. I tell you this becaus i am presently working in the medical field.	0
I don't know.... I guess parents GIVING BIRTH TO US AND RAISING US AND TAKING CARE OF US AND WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR US, there isn't anything we owe them..... *sarcasm	You're assuming that all parents do those things. What about parents who adopt? What about when one parent leaves? What about abusive/neglectful parents?  *reality check Having and raising children is still a choice on the part of the parent(s), not the child. So even if parents are really great there's no reason why their child would be obligated to do anything for them. Of course, I think really good parents would have children that want to take care of them if/when they need to, but not because it's their duty as their child.	0

i mean the license for self defence	It is not illegal to kill someone out of self defense. As long as it is not taken to far or out of context. If an old man is running at you with his cane you do not have the right to shoot him. If he had a spiked mace you do have the right. If that man is in your house running at you with his cane ( as long as he has broken in ) you have the right to shoot him. I mean if what you are talking about is have a license to murder someone over a despute then that is not technically self defense. Self defense already is not illegal. It is murder that is illegal not murder in self defense. I do not think that YOU are stupid I just find that this debate to be rather on the incognizant side.	0

It's actually pretty simple. You can attack flaws and specifics within the texts and practices of a religion, but ultimately an individuals faith is his or her own. If you attack a specific passage that that individual happens to see as a metaphor, you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. If you do the same to a religious individual who concedes that there may be inaccuracies in the text due to oral tradition, translation and re-translation, again you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. Attacking the general flaws of religious texts is pretty much pointless because of that- it MIGHT be useful in the odd case of the individual believer who considers the entirety of the writings to be both literal and infallible, but those individuals tend to be particularly inflexible in their beliefs and fairly close minded to facts even if placed right in front of them.	Yeah, I mean, you might not like what NAMBLA stands for, but saying anything about it is pointless as the viewpoints of individual members are their own (maybe they just go to the meetings for the potluck).	0

"To quote Christopher Hitchens... "" I believe in irony. I say that we do have free will, because we have no choice.

"I should make it clear that I didn't watch the video and am making the point that certain people who celebrate Christmas refuse to call it that. ""X-Mas"" would be an example. It's kind of like if you were to drive a Ford and say that it's a Chevy. You can call it a Chevy, but it's really a Ford. Same goes for Christmas. You can call it something else, but it's really Christmas. I don't think Christmas is associated with Christianity as much as it used to be. It's basically Santa-Day to most people.  I wouldn't say that St. Patrick's Day is divorced from it's origins, just that most people are unknowingly celebrating a religious holiday... and the thing is, I don't think people would really care, religious or not.  I can only really speak for myself here, but Christmas to me is about family and showing that you care about them. I'm not religious, so the whole birth of Jesus thing isn't a big deal to me, but I don't mind being part of a tradition that celebrates his birth. Jesus had some great teachings. Some of the stuff from the Bible was pretty screwed up, but there are some good bits, which mostly came from the teachings of Jesus. Christmas in the religious sense is a celebration of Jesus, not the Bible in it's entirety.  I understand, that since you are a homosexual, you feel like an outcast from anything Christian-related. You have to realize why homosexuality has been frowned upon throughout history. I believe that it's more instinctual for heterosexuals to find it wrong because we're wired to maintain our species. Homosexuality can only be acceptable when it is a minority, because if it were a majority then the human race would be declining.  Homosexuality was considered to be a sin because it was believed to be a choice, which as a heterosexual, I can only compare your mindset to mine. I'm just naturally attracted to women, so I can only assume that you are naturally attracted to men. I'm sure you didn't wake up one day and say ""Forget women, I'm going to try out men!"". The problem was that men weren't and most still aren't, able to wrap their heads around the notion that certain men are naturally attracted to other men... or that some women are naturally attracted to other women. So, since they thought it was a choice, they also thought that it could catch on, or become a trend. Rather than using a population as large as the world's, I'll use the people of Old Testament, aka Israel. They feared that if homosexuality were to become popular and become the majority population in Israel, then their people would eventually cease to exist. So, because of this mindset, desperate measures were taken to try and prevent people from becoming homosexuals. They weren't wrong though. If the majority of the world was gay, then the human population definitely would end up declining. They just happened to be ignorant of the reason why certain people are gay.  Religion has maintained the survival of ancient thought and now modern thought is finally starting to take over. Christianity will eventually evolve and possibly even die out, but Christmas will likely always exist... and not just the tradition, but the name as well, because we like to know the origins of our cultures and traditions. What Christmas should be and what it likely will eventually be, is a celebration of family, history and humanity."	"I should make it clear that I didn't watch the video [...] not the Bible in it's entirety. We agree on people being able to call their own holiday whatever they want.  My experience of Christmas is that it is still considerably more religious (at least in terms of frequency) relative to St. Patrick's day. The simple fact that most people know Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus, but no one even knows what St. Patrick did.  Christmas being a celebration of even a portion of the religion still makes it a representation of Christianity and the institution of religion at large. I understand, that since you are a homosexual, you feel like an outcast from anything Christian-related. I am not homosexual. I am a pansexual, transgender man. My identities are not even in the Bible, nor do they inherently preclude reproduction but I have been consistently discriminated against socially and legally expressly and exclusively on account of religion. I doubt that you actually understand what that is like, or exactly how that has affected my relationship with religion. I do not feel like an outcast from religion. I feel like an oppressed minority who has been treated like a second-class citizen my entire life for absolutely reason than other peoples' religiously validated prejudice. Homosexuality and other queer identities have not been consistently frowned upon throughout history. Rome is the most consistently cited example of acceptance, but there are others.  The reproduction argument is, frankly, total bullshit. Christianity (and religion generally) celebrates the celibate; it's most venerated leaders are celebrated for their lack of reproduction. The sterile do not face equitable discrimination, nor have the elderly been prohibited from marrying or enjoying equal rights to younger couples. At any rate, humans are not wired to promote collective reproduction but personal reproduction. Reproduction arguments are nothing more than retroactive attempts to justify a pre-existing prejudice. The argument about ""choice"" and the ""contagion"" of homosexuality is equally asinine. Even if a person believed/believes homosexuality is a choice there is absolutely no rational basis for the purported fear that it would become so popular as to endanger the survival of the human species. We have known for thousands of years that homosexuality existed, and that it was practiced without condemnation... and that it has never become an endangering contagion. History aside, there is simply no reason at all to think that homosexuality would become more popular than heterosexuality. None. I mean, is gay sex supposed to be better? Why would a prejudicial heterosexual even think that? The fear of ""contagion"" is nothing more than a projection of personal insecurity, and again an attempt to justify pre-existing prejudice. Religion has maintained the survival of ancient thought and now modern thought is finally starting to take over. Christianity will eventually evolve and possibly even die out, but Christmas will likely always exist... and not just the tradition, but the name as well, because we like to know the origins of our cultures and traditions. What Christmas should be and what it likely will eventually be, is a celebration of family, history and humanity. Religion has retarded the development of societies, past and present. It has consistently and persistently resisted social, legal, and scientific progress and advancement. The only function it has ever served is to reassure the emotional insecurities of those too psychologically weak to reconcile their insignificance and mortality with their ego and biological drive for survival. The day when humanity evolves out of its need for religion is long distant, but when and if that happens society will be far better for it. In all likelihood Christmas will not live long past the extinction of Christianity. Hundreds and thousands of holidays of dead and dying religions have passed into forgotten history... why should Christian holidays be any different? The mere suggestion reflects the vanity of the Christian faith. We do not need religion to celebrate family, history, and humanity. I have never needed it as an excuse to celebrate any of that. I have, though, frequently had religion impede my relationships, attempt to rewrite and erase my history, and invalidate my humanity."	0

The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1967   1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  3. When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  9. Do not harm little children.  10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.	Interesting material, but if I'm honest, Satanism scares me. Number 11 seems to be interesting, it seems a bit dramatic.	0

What?!? We should not reduce our emissions, because that would increase our emissions? We are luckily working on cleaner technologies. They will save us money.

We only know what a fraction of our DNA does, and the rest is considered 'junk', or vestigial. That would be acceptable, except for the presence of Pyknons [1]. 3) Living transitional species. Once again, probably weak, but it would seem that if evolution happened once, it could, and should happen again. But we only see pure species, not to mention wholly developed organs. Such design implies a creator. 3.1) Rebuttal: but our genetic code is so much the same that it implies we had the same ancestors. Counter-rebuttal: My house and the house across the street are probably made from around 99% of the same material, and yet are vastly different constructions. This is due to a designer. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. These aren't solid arguments, but they're a start.	"Many would argue the fantastic complexity of your body, but this argument is lost on you. Evolution accounts for our body. We are primates, after all. 1) Vestigial organs. If evolution were true, we'd have loads. But we don't have any. Things thought to be vestigial in the past have been found to have functions. You mean like our wisdom teeth, and ""goosebumps"" which come from a natural reflex to make ourselves appear bigger by raising our body hair. Then there's the part of our sweat glands which emit an odour. This body odour is part of our identity but is no longer useful. 2) Vestigial DNA. Same argument as above, but this one has semi-less merit. We only know what a fraction of our DNA does, and the rest is considered 'junk', or vestigial. That would be acceptable, except for the presence of Pyknons [1]. Our introns store deactivated endogenous retroviral sequences whose positions are used to indicate a hereditary relationship with other animals, notably the lower primates. <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10254.long'>Example Junk DNA is a misnomer, as it is merely a popular colloquial term for introns, or non-coding DNA. Pyknons are merely an extra level of cell metabolism regulation. 3) Living transitional species. Once again, probably weak, but it would seem that if evolution happened once, it could, and should happen again. But we only see pure species, not to mention wholly developed organs. Such design implies a creator. Evolution doesn't work that way. Organisms do not appear suddenly. Instead we see a subtle change in populations over generations. Unless of course we are dealing with very simple organisms like E. coli, in that case we can evolve entirely new metabolisms in our lifetimes. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant  Here is a great example of evolution in progress, recorded. Transitional forms also do not mean an incomplete organ. Each stage of transition has a complete organ or metabolism, what happens is that its purpose changes along the way. 3.1) Rebuttal: but our genetic code is so much the same that it implies we had the same ancestors. Counter-rebuttal: My house and the house across the street are probably made from around 99% of the same material, and yet are vastly different constructions. This is due to a designer. Inheritance implies a nested hierarchy in trait distribution. Design implies common themes with no restraint to boundary. Our distribution of traits indicates inheritance, not design."	0
If medical services should be free, should we: 1. Pay for people wanting to be a doctor to go to med school? 2. Make all medical and pharma companies part of the goverment? 3. Take all decision making about treatment out of the hands of the individual and their doctor? I think not!	I have no standing about 2. and I feel that 3. would be a bad thing, but 1. makes some sense to me. Scholarships are basically free money from the government to people who want to learn something to better society. I think if becoming a doctor was less expensive, there'd be more.  Even the rules of economics say that if the number of producers is high, the price of products will be low. In this situation the doctors count as producers and heir services the product.	0
Oh bullocks. I am not talking about foreigners running for President. I am talking about CITIZENS running for President. All that matters is whether you have been an Amen for at least ten years, and will be in the future. Being an American is NOT about where you are born, but where your heart is.	There are 2 different types of citizens: 1.Natural citizens and 2.Naturalized Citizens. Natural citizens are born in the US while naturalized have to acquire citizenship. They are all Americans. But having a naturalized citizen with foreign ties wouldn't understand the American side of things as much as an American who was born here. The fear would be the same as I mentioned previously. Your heart could be in the right place, buts it's the fear that someone could is what keeps the law.	0

Of course it is. Agnostics are merely fence-sitters waiting for somebody to give them a shove to one side or the other.	Actually technically everybody is an agnostic to some degree. Atheists and theists are also agnostic at the same time. You might think you KNOW that there is a god or isn't one, but in the end you don't know because we can't know as of right now because there's no way to test for him.  Agnosticism isn't bullshit, it's being honest. I'm an atheist but I'm also an agnostic because I don't believe I god, but I can't know for sure that he isn't real for sure.	0
"No. Would you want to be adopted by a gay couple? Think about all the bullying you'll get at school. Thats the worst thing that could happen to me, for my parents to both be male or female, how would i know what a proper relationship was meant to be like? Wheres my father or mother figure? So If I have two dads, how would I cope when I see my friends with their mums and dads. I think that Homesexuals being able to adopt is just wrong. If they were meant to have children together they would have been born with both genitals for goodness sake. Its not natural, its not how the world was supposed to be all this ""Allowed to love who you want"" is just bullshit to be honest. I know most people wont agree but next thing you will all be backing up Incest. ""Whats wrong with loving your sister?"" .. :l"	"No. Would you want to be adopted by a gay couple? If I was a homeless child, I would probably want to be adopted by any loving, secure couple that wanted me. Think about all the bullying you'll get at school. That's not the fault of the gay parents or the child, that's the fault of homophobes and hateful people. Don't blame the victims. Thats the worst thing that could happen to me, for my parents to both be male or female, how would i know what a proper relationship was meant to be like? By watching your parents, who hopefully would be supportive, understanding, and patient. A heterosexual relationship is not necessarily healthy, functional, or a good model for a child to look on. They can be very toxic. The adoption process would have the added benefit of screening out some of these unstable marriages.   If they were meant to have children together they would have been born with both genitals for goodness sake. Nobody is predestined by fate to reproduce with anyone in particular, or not at all. We all have a choice. This logic would erase adoption all together, because people who were 'meant to have children' would already have them. Its not natural, its not how the world was supposed to be all this Homosexuality occurs quite frequently in nature, thus by definition, it is natural. It has existed in all human cultures throughout all of human history, so if there is a way the word is 'supposed to be', then that definition would include homosexuality.  ""Allowed to love who you want"" is just bullshit to be honest. I know most people wont agree but next thing you will all be backing up Incest. ""Whats wrong with loving your sister?"" .. :l People cannot help who they love but in the case of incest, any children resulting from an incestuous relationship are likely to bear slight to severe mutations. Most animals, humans included, come equipped with a fairly strong aversion to breeding with family for this reason, and this is why incest is frowned upon; it has the high likelihood of hurting an innocent human being."	0

I will go with Christianity because I saw the Satanist List did not include murder so Christianity would be the more logical list.	"Satanism's morality operates on the assumption that from day one starting in the religion or philosophy you already have a basic modern sense of morality. These things include murder, stealing, rape, ect. You know, obvious shit that any sensible person today knows as a toddler. Also since most Satanists are atheists, theres no supernatural punishments for these things. Where does the punishment exist you ask? In the law. The federal laws of 1st world countries.  So to sum it up, it (along with rape and other big ""sins"") doesnt need to be included because its common knowledge and is handled by the society the person lives in.  This is unlike Christianity which, like a broken record, prattles on to the reader in today's context about moral lessons they most likely already know and have known since they were 9.  Satanism skips the obvious and promotes ideas that are not as obvious to people such as the persuit of knowledge I.e stupidity on that list."	0

I do understand what you mean, that the events recently can serve as exposure or awareness to a certain issue. But when the issue is equivalent to the debates on gun control after these shootings, it's a little manipulative, like taking advantage of a situation that isn't necessarily related. Maybe the debate here would and should be diagnosing when a loved one has a mental illness.	Of course is manipulative, that is how big politics works now, right or wrong.  But i don't think it is smart to be talking about the issue immediatly after such a tradgey like the shooting takes place. It is like going to the grocrey store when you are hungry, you over commentate on how you are feeling at that exact moment, and may come to regret it later on.	0
If school shootings are partially impossible to prevent, then why before 1966 there were no school shootings ever reported. Well, before 1966, government's monopoly of education was non-existent, and schools and teachers had much more control over the behavior of students on the campus and in the classroom. Trouble teenagers and young adults are directly related to the lack of discipline implemented by parents and teachers. Therefore, bullying ensues.	This all may be possible, but to just make the claim that public education leads to bullying and mass murder is... farfetch'd. I agree that privatized education would be better at combating these issues, but I'm not gonna try to say that correlation, in this case, has proven causation.	0
I don't feel that means they will bad mouth God. If we take it at its truest meaning, it is a congregation where God is not talked about. I would have to see what the do in this congregation because I can't even imagine it at all. If there was a similar organization that called themselves a god worshiping congregation do you think many atheists would feel welcomed? I don't really think that is the problem, and I don't think it would be so bad for Atheists to go to that. The biggest problem with the Christian congregations is that they add the part that not worshiping God makes you a bad person. If it was a God congregation where people discuss what they are thankful for and attribute it to God, but don't look down on those who don't attribute it to God, I think they could get some Atheists to show up.	"If it was a God congregation where people discuss what they are thankful for and attribute it to God, but don't look down on those who don't attribute it to God, I think they could get some Atheists to show up. They might get a few to show up, but I think they would be few and far between. I know I wouldn't go.  Their charter seems very contradictory. It says, ""Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential. Our vision: a godless congregation in every town, city and village that wants one."" The first sentence says ""everyone"" but the second sentence says ""a godless congregation."" A godless congregation is not ""everyone."" I just think if someone is going to start a new church with the motto ""live better, help often, wonder more"" whose goal is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"", then saying things that make people feel excluded is unwise and makes me question their motives. If I'm questioning their motives and I'm an atheist, I can't imagine how distrustful a theist would be of them. I would have to see what the do in this congregation because I can't even imagine it at all. I agree. The whole concept seems very strange to me and I would have to go to one to see what really goes on there."	0
Just wondering, how do 'they' ('them' being the generic people who say things) know this? Is it becasue they looked far enough away to equate the age of the sun and figure what they see was uniform throughout the universe. Bits of evidence are left behind, like certain radioactive isotopes and we can observe the formation of stars in the universe with our massive telescopes. We look at history every day when we look to the sky, because our universe is so vast and light travels so slowly. We can observe the past-formation of stars, exploding supernovas, etc. By making these and other observations we can deduce how our early solar system must have been. Or is it because the look at the evidence and form a theory to explain it in a way that takes God out of the picture. Not that doing so is a bad thing, but it is bad to pass that theory as fact in absense of evidence. As explained before: god is not science. Science does not work by invoking magic, or sacrificing animals to an altar. It relies on the knowable, which requires that we do not invoke supernatural, magical concepts. When you invoke god, you enter the territory of the unknowable, which means that you can never expand knowledge since you cannot verify your claims. If the sun was 'birthed' before there was enough mass to naturally light it, wouldn't the force of fusion push the vital hydrogen away from the core, making it impossible to continue burning naturally? It was not ignited prematurely but bits of dense mass were hurled into it, accelerating the process greatly. I know this, too. The list was symbollic. I obviously didn't list all the dialects and their parents. What then are your objections remaining? We see that languages diverge, create new words and grammar schemes, so how can you maintain that language is getting simpler when more keep popping up?

We look at history every day when we look to the sky, because our universe is so vast and light travels so slowly. We can observe the past-formation of stars, exploding supernovas, etc. I understand the concept of time being distance.  Science does not work by invoking magic, or sacrificing animals to an altar. It relies on the knowable, which requires that we do not invoke supernatural, magical concepts. I realize that science doesn't, or shouldn't evoke magic. But what happens when we come across something that cannot be explained by nature? There are many questions science cannot answer right now (origins are usually the category--life, the universe, the first stars, etc.) But the scientists looking for the answers think they know them already. In doing experiments, they already have the conclusion in mind. When finding the origin of life, they know that all life had a single ancestor, and thus they're much, much, much more likely to disregard the contrary evidence (as I don't do these experiments, I'm not sure if there is any, but I'm sure if there was, it wouldn't be published) as faulty data. What I see science doing now is finding evidence to prove a conclusion, when it should be finding conclusions to fit the evidence. What then are your objections remaining? We see that languages diverge, create new words and grammar schemes, so how can you maintain that language is getting simpler when more keep popping up? Language as a whole might be getting more complex, but languages are getting more simple. That's my argument. I honestly don't really care about modern languages, but comparing what we have to what we had. Comparing modern languages to ancient Asian, Mesopotamian, American (north and south), and Scandinavian. All those old languages are much more complex than what we have today.	0
I don't understand why this person is not allowed to do so by your arguments implication. If the person is not praying loudly, or purposefully trying to include or pester others, is it truly a problem? I don't think so. Their praying doesn't necessarily affect the purpose you initially held. However, I would be most pleased to hear your side of the argument.	The government has no right to promote any sort of religion, they should be allowed to pray as long as it is on their own merits, what I'm arguing against is government mandated christian prayer, payed for with my tax money.	0
If they aren't happy being celebrities they should stop doing the things that make them famous. If having tons of fame and money doesn't come with happiness, we would have a whole lot less celebrities.	"If they do stop all their achievements would be for nothing sense most of them are smart and won't give up because they are tough enough they will continue what they are doing. Having tons of fame and money is harder than what it looks. Before people judge that and listening/looking at half of what the celebrities go through that's why ""normal people"" can't handle it. Wouldn't know until you walk in others shoes."	0
"There are two issues I see with a ""junk food"" tax. Number one, bad food is not unhealthy in moderation. If someone runs a marathon, then eats a bunch of cheesecake, that's fine for them, and they don't need to be punished. Many people are perfectly healthy by balancing bad food with exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general. Number two, it is very difficult to determine what is junk food and what is not objectively. Sure, we can all say ""oh, well obviously McDonald's is bad"", but creating a USDA regulation off of this is quite difficult, and encourages cheating to evade an extra tax."	You can be skinny, and have other issues like high cholesterol and heart issues. Just because someone looks healthy, doesn't mean that they are.	0
If you don't want to recognize that all conscious power is executed through a logical framework it won't change this reality. Consciousness is not a mythical power, it is a state of the mind. More importantly, the mind does not have a logical framework but is instead ordered around the pressures of evolution, the most notable of which is anxiety (#neuroscience). It is a complex system that we do not understand completely but ThePyg is right, calling our ignorance God is rather useless and naive.

Oh again the philisoficial and theistic confusion. Sorry you really need to specify with satanism because the differences are so vast yet the name Carys with it an image. You understand just be clearer to avoid misconceptions.	"Of course, totally valid point. But this isn't my debate. If it was I would've already specified in the description as I did in my lag post. But also, these ""sins"" are the same for theistic and philisophical. In theistic satanism all these things are applied literally as teachings and sins, and in atheistic satanic philosophy they are a moral code and philosophic ideals. So you're really not valid when you say the thing about murder because it applies to satanism in all contexts. I hope this makes sense."	0
"More often than not, atheist do not say that ""there is no god"" it's far more likely for them to say that they ""do not believe in god."" Atheism, by itself, isn't a religion b/c it rejects religious dogmas. It does not attmpt to explain the world, it does not attempt to indoctrinate others (usually) atheism is simply the skeptical viewpoint of whether or not there is a diety. They usually say ""I don't believe in a god becuase no evidence of a god has been presented."" If there was evidence for a diety, then there would a lot less atheist. there are Atheistic religions, though, but they often involve some supernatural aspect. There are very few,if any Anti-theistic religions, I believe. Many atheist and anti-religious people understand exactly what a religion is, it is often the theist and the religious who do not.  Personally I find religion in general to be unnecessary and a belief in a god or gods as a delusion. (P.S. Theism isn't a religion either.)"	"There are different usage definitions for the word ""religion"" One can say that they have no religion and simply mean that there is no specific sect that they wish to exclusively identify with (non-denominationalism) I am an atheist who admits that everyone has a religion (belief/value system). My atheism is part of my belief/value system. Note the different usage here. I am not using it to mean ""denomination"" Try thinking of it like this.

No its not ok, unless you are a person who does not care about the person and only interested in the flesh and self gratification.	I have sex with my fiance and have done for the last 2 years. Does that mean I don't care about him and I'm only interested in self gratification? No, it doesn't. I have sex with him because firstly I love him. Secondly it feels really good.

You're assuming that everyone believes the stories of the Bible. There is so much evidence showing that the Bible is not a reliable source of information, that we can't take anything is says at face value. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that we evolved, and that the story of Adam and Eve never actually happened. Even many Christian religions have come to accept this given the overwhelming amount of evidence supporting evolution. I think we would be going to far off topic if we start debating evolution, but if you want to I can create a new debate about it.	Let me get it back. I didnt mean to interfere with your conversation with the other debater.. but... You're assuming that everyone believes the stories of the Bible. So you're assuming that everyone doesnt believe it? There is so much evidence showing that the Bible is not a reliable source of information, that we can't take anything is says at face value. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that we evolved, and that the story of Adam and Eve never actually happened.  Yes, if you studied, then you'd know that it is not really reliable at all. Not all people take everything the Bible says, even other Catholics disproce of the things that are written there. As for the Adam and Eve, what if they lived in our past, and they existed, but then, we never knew that they were Adam and Eve because people changed their names?   Even many Christian religions have come to accept this given the overwhelming amount of evidence supporting evolution. I think we would be going to far off topic if we start debating evolution, but if you want to I can create a new debate about it. Yes, Im a Catholic.. and most of my teachers are scientists, but still, they accept the thought of having a religion. I dont understand why others dont.

I was speaking more towards the composition of me and the objects around me, a being imagining all the atoms and their subatomic paticles simultaneously is impossible. It is too extreme of detail.	but the composition isn't completely seen either. When you image a tree, or a hose, or whatever you don't think of every individual particle coming together to make that object, or the light reflecting off of the surface of whatever to make the color, or the way it is also spinning with the earth, and the affect gravity is having on it, nope you just imaging the object.

Although I am not convinced that Atheism is a religion, I would like to disagree with your point on Atheist's lack of faith as you define it.  The Cosmological Argument (a philosophically valid argument) states that the universe exists by conforming to one of three possible options. Either: 1.) The universe has always existed and everything is a dependant being 2.) The Universe was created by a self existent being (God) 3.) Or the Universe has no explanation (which makes no sense). So while there is no real proof to accept the existence of a Self-Existent being (aka a God), there is no reason to deny him. You can disagree with some definitions of God, like an all knowing, all loving, and all powerful God, but to DENY his existence requires some amount of belief (aka faith). If you want to deny all four of these points one would have to be Agnostic.	It would not take faith to deny the existence of a being you had never heard of. In other words, you don't disbelieve my imaginary friend Kevin, having never heard of him before, you only lack belief that my imaginary friend Kevin is real. There is no proof needed to disprove my imaginary friend Kevin, because if the idea of my imaginary Kevin had never been brought up the topic of belief or disbelief, and existence or inexistence would have never been brought up. Therefore atheists are not denying his existence they just fail to see it as even being relevant.	0

You are forcing your idiotic bullshit onto others by saying they will absolutely burn in hell that doesn't even exist, because their opinions differ - not respectful at all. you don't see me saying bad things about what you believe now do I?

Prince meant to ask you about scientific inventions and not this fowl. Please be careful enough to not include such words in My Dabates, please! and anyway, that lead to increase in surplus population who cut trees and kill animals!	Don't be so crude and childish. Sex is a wonderful thing, and if it wasn't, then explain how it creates something so beautiful. I was being totally serious. Sex positions are a human 'invention' just as art is, and story telling. Are you telling me these things harm the environment? Perhaps they put ideas in people's heads or shift a younger one's thinking, but these things are not capable of harming nature, because they do not require anything beyond the imagination. It's amazing. People demonize sex because it feels good, and at the same time, it's a holy thing that must between a married man and a woman. It's the act of making a child. I don't understand why that's foul, but that's probably because I don't take everything at face value. Besides, everyone knows if you don't want to overpopulate the world, you don't have sex like a rabbit every night.	0

Ps3 is better because it has free online Free online...that gets hacked...and then people lose all their money. Yeah, I'm happy paying $50 a year to play Xbox Live knowing my credit card information is safe. also has games that Xbox doesn't have like Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance 1,2, and 3, Uncharted 1.2,and 3, God of War 1,2,3. God of War Chains of Olympus, God of War Ghost of Sparta, Heavenly Sword, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Killzone 1,2,3 God of War 1 and 2 were made for the PS2, not PS3. God of War Chains of Olympus and God of War Ghost of Sparta were made for the PSP, not PS3. Killzone 1 was made for the PS2, not PS3.  We also have a built in Bluray player and also our games are built in with bluray. Also some games that the Xbox has like L.A Noire has 4 discs because it doesn't have Bluray. Also Bluray is a Sony product and if Xbox wants to have it then they have to pay sony since its there product.  Better technology doesn't mean a better game console. You also failed to mention the fact that PS3 has obsolete graphics, the R.R.P (Recommended Retail Price) is so high it's insane, and that the PS3 has a much slower loading time for its games. Please don't say the Xbox 360 is crap because it breaks all the time (red ring of death) because that problem has been fixed for the past 2 years ever since the new Xbox 360 consoles were brought into the market.	God of War 1&2;(God of War Collection) were remade from onto the ps3 so basically yes they did make 1 and 2 for ps3 but had trophies and put HD into one and two. God of War Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus they were on PSP but made into ps3 for trophies and in HD. (God of War Origins Collection) Ps3 has a much slower loading time for its games Not really it loads perfectly fine for all my games. Who ever hacked ps3 was stupid and idiotic they just wanted to ruin our fun. If you look on Youtube on the console wars they say that the better system is PS3 and it tells you why.	0

First of all, straight people don't get a pass when it comes to adoption. There are certain requirements that must be met. Those requirements apply to gays as well. Again, gays can marry anyone they want, anywhere they want, whenever they want (as long as it is someone of the opposite sex). If certain religions don't accept gays, gays are free to start their own religion. If there are other countries that allow same sex marriages, then gays are free to go live there. This isn't communist China.	uh a gay person doesn't want to marry someone of the opposite sex. why the hell would you even think they would. By the way that's two different rights. There's same sex marriage and str8 marriage and gay people don't marry people from the opposite sex for some obvious reasons. Gays currently can not adopt children. Yes str8 people have to meet requirements but they won't let gays have kids because there afraid of how the child will react.	0

"What is the point of blocking certain words from viewers? What are we trying to hide? Why do people care in the first place about one word that is considered ""taboo"" to be said. The whole idea of censoring words is similar to censoring certain movements. If someone lifts up their arm and raises their middle finger, this is understood as offensive. Pointing at someone is considered ""rude."" So what happens when I stick my arms out and spin around? If I do this trying to be offensive, should everyone else understand it as offensive? I doubt they would.  This is an argument that has been made before, but is important, and I believe that this argument should not be forgotten. There are certain collections of sounds; certain collections of movements, which in certain cultures, are offensive.  As for nudity; kind of the same idea. We're all born with one of two sets of parts. About half of the people on Earth have one set, and about half have another set. Should I not be allowed to see something because I don't have it? It's part of the human body. And once you see it once, what's the point of censoring it again? You've already seen it, so what are they protecting you from there? I don't get it. If someone feels that they can explain it to me, go ahead. Either reply to me here or leave a message on my profile, but either way, I'm serious.

Is there no trickle up theory of death? George Bush started an illegal invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. During his presidency almost 100,000 civilians were killed. In 2007 alone, 24,000 civilians were killed and only 19,000 insurgents. Because he started these wars, and he ordered our soldiers to kill others, and our soldiers displayed a lack of respect towards innocent life, isn't it his fault that they weren't properly prepared for the responsibility he placed in their hands?	"Here is a fact that anyone who took U.S Government knows. The President of the United States can not start a war. It is Congress who has the power to go to war. If you are going to blame anyone, blame people like Hilliary Clinton who voted to go to war. Congress has the Power to Declare War, not the President of the United States.

DNA is made up of the same four bases, no matter what species it comes from. All it takes is x sequence of bases to make one species, and y sequence of bases to make a different species.  If you are talking about interspecies fertilization, if fertilization even occurred (it wouldn't, due to the massive difference in chromosome number between a dog and a cat), it would not result in viable fetuses. The more the DNA of parents diverge, the less likely they are to breed in the first place, achieve fertilization, and produce viable offspring. We can see examples of interspecies breeding at various levels of genetic divergence: Different breeds of dogs can produce a mutt; it is not purebred, but still healthy. A horse and a donkey can produce a mule; it may be healthy, but it is infertile.  A sheep and a goat can rarely produce an embryo; it is generally either miscarried or stillborn. Other species may attempt to interbreed, but fertilization is never even achieved. Many more species have no sexual interest in each other.	I'm not talking about interbreeding, I'm talking about replacing the DNA of a dog egg cell with that of a cat and growing it. It's a dog cell with cat DNA. Would it grow?	0

OK, all kidding aside, if we make a blanket statement that they do not chose to be homosexuals then the slippery slope I fear is that some nut is going to claim that he can cure homosexuality through genetic engineering.

I was completely talking about a couple who are in this together. I am refering to a typical couple who are talking about abortion. The question implies the man is there anyway.	Well I suppose if the man is involved, and it was perfectly mutual then he should have some say, but ultimately it has to be her choice. If she does not want to carry the child because of some insecurities and she feels she is not ready for a child, he has to accept her decision. And especially with deciding for abortion. If she wants to keep the child he has to accept that decision even if he was just trying to get rid of it just to save his wallet.	0

"Obviously humans use the power of the sun everyday. That's not my point. And you've failed to realize this.

You're saying ""after lengths of time there has been more destruction than the bombings of Japan""....who gives a shit, that is obvious.... what kind of example is that?  I have studied this as well and obviously you're wrong."	"Abused? The bomb killed less people in total. We killed more in bombings and napalm strikes.  ""You're saying ""after lengths of time there has been more destruction than the bombings of Japan""....who gives a shit, that is obvious.... what kind of example is that?"" I never said that. Not once. Would you rather us engage in hand to hand combat and lose more lives? Sounds like it. Also I am only saying facts. "" As a result, Prime Minister Suzuki felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on."" This is from wiki. Japan ignored our warnings.  "" The Potsdam Declaration or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender is a statement that called for the Surrender of the Empire of Japanduring World War II. On July 26, 1945, United States President Harry S. Truman, United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Chairman of the Nationalist Government of China Chiang Kai-shek issued the document, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face ""prompt and utter destruction"" although the document did not make any mention of atomic weapons."" Now it did not mention the atomic bombs so I give you that but when other countries are okay with this and give a chance for Japan to either surrender or fight on it is pretty fair. Also the bombs killed hundreds of thousands. Not millions. We would have lost millions if we had never dropped it. So you can choose which desicion is more acceptable in terms of war."	0

Then if skin cells are capable of developing into a human being then maybe we should take your skin cells and develop them into a human being through a natural reproductive process. Natural reproduction doesn't matter here. Otherwise you're arguing that artificially inseminated women do not give birth to human beings. You can clone a human from skin cells. This is asexual reproduction. Are flatworms humans? Do they have a human body? So why then a person is pronounced dead or alive or even to a fetus depending on the availability of the heartbeats? A fully developed person is pronounced dead when losing a heartbeat because it is a critical process for maintaining life. A foetus is in that grey zone of not being fully developed and thus not needing a proper beating heart yet. So then we should kill anyone who has lost their personhood, right? Because according to you the fetus shhould be killed because it is not a person? Maybe we should do that to people in coma or unconcious too. A person has not lost their personhood until their brain has degenerated past a point that they lose their individuality, and are basically nothing more than a brain stem. At that point, I don't care if they live or die. Use them for livestock feed for all I care. Again scientists have proved that a person who becomes fully unconscious has lost their personhood by losing all the elements of personhood. So are you a scientist or a doctor to dispute this fact? If they have an intact brain, then they have not lost their personhood. What you probably misunderstood is that higher brain functions cease in unconscious people, but they are not gone. So then if the fetus is like a brain dead person, then how come the brain still maintains the growth and blood circluation in the unborn? And a brain dead person is an individual who has recieved damaged to their brain resulting in a major ineffiency of the brain to control body and chemical movements which is completely the oppostie in the fetus. Brain stems can control elementary body functions. A foetus doesn't have a well-developed brain. Again they were born but now they are dead, right? A man can be born innocent but because he commits a crime, doesn't mean that he will be innocent, will he?  Your question isn't formed in a way that I can answer, I need you to retype it. So then what is the difference between the unborn and a person who has lost their personhood? Oh wait, according to you, one is already born and the other unborn. The only difference is the fetus is in a womb and you keep saying that they have no life but you have no scientific fact disputing my claim. I keep saying that they have no personhood. Not every life has personhood. A braindead man has no personhood. A foetus has no personhood. A fetus deserves the right because it is a human organism, it has life as determined by doctors and it is a growing human being.  The skin cells you scrape off when you brush against a sharp wire are human organisms. They don't deserve rights. A foetus is like those skin cells, but with a primitive brain. What about tumours then? Shouldn't they have rights under your blanket definition of what deserves personhood? They are human organisms. Oh and by the way, the only difference between a baby borned on the first day and the baby about to be born is one is out of the womb and one is in, which is the only difference but a baby born already also does not have personhood. Right, however for convenience we grant a born infant rights while we grant a foetus no rights. If you want rights, be born. I have a question for you: how is one supposed to be able to experiment on human systems if foetuses are granted human rights? Foetuses are presently unpeople, our only way to experiment on something that is human but not a person. What should we use then if foetuses become illegal for this? What if I wish to test the development of a human brain? A foetus has a developing brain but it isn't self aware. So now I can't use it? You are really damning a lot of interesting scientific opportunities.	But fetuses are created from natural processes not artificial processes so your reference to cloning is invaluable to me. Cloning is an artificial process whereas sexual reproduction is a natural process involving the fusion of the sperm and egg to form a zygote. When you artificially inseminate women you are also creating the fusion of an egg and a sperm which is a natual reproductive process. According to you, heartbeat is a critical process for maintaining life so which means that the presence of heartbeat in a fetus should maintain the presence of life? If a fetus does not have a proper heartbeat, then how come circulation of blood takes place at a normal rate? If there wasn't a proper heartbeat, then there would have been an abnormal blood circulation and oxygen from the mother causing the fetus to appear blue. Even if they are not gone, they are still not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts, right? And this is similar to a fetus which has an intact brain with the presence of life but is not self aware or do not have any level of self concepts. And even to people who has lost their personhood still have rights in terms of property rights and also in many cases the brain can be tempoarily damaged leading to a severe coma as in my case when i was stricken with asthma. But then at that point they have lost their person hood because they cannot touch or feel, are not self aware or do not have self concepts and does not have any level of understanding. Also because they are in a coma and has lost their personhood does not mean that we should kill them because many people can end up recovering. A brain dead person is similar to a fetus in that even though the brain is not capable of functioning fully, it can also perform other chemical and body processes or reactions. What i am trying to portray to you is that because a person cannot move or think or feel does not mean that you or anybody has the right to kill them.  But a brain dead man who has no sign of personhood can also recover from a coma? right? If the human body is referred to as a human organism then anything coming from that body is also part of that organism, right? Why? Because there is the same genetic type and DNA and those skin cells are the very cells that identifies the human organism or human body? However, in dealing with a fetus we should understand that those cells are the developing body of a human organism with a completely different and whole or complete DNA and blood type. Do skin cells have a different DNA? Dont DNA identifies a separate human identity? Tumors are not human organisms but rather caused by major viruses or exposure to certain chemicals or particles which may destroy or affect the normal fuctioning of the human body. So my question to you is, why then do we use living people to undergo medical research or even for scientific research? Dont these people undergo experimentation on their human systems? And don't they have rights of personhood?	0

"Iron man is reckless and would not make a good president. Whereas batman has a strong sense of patriotism, has strong moral principles, and understands the economy. He is also very cultural, and clearly the smarter of the two. Moreover, he is very diplomatic and has a small ego, which is important when serving a country and not yourself. Consider these actual Batman quotes: Dick Grayson: ""What's so important about Chopin?"" Bruce Wayne: ""All music is important, Dick. It's the universal language. One of our best hopes for the eventual realization of the brotherhood of man.""  Batman: ""Better put 5 cents in the meter."" Robin: ""No policeman's going to give the Batmobile a ticket."" Batman: ""This money goes to building better roads. We all must do our part."" Batman: ""Human mechanisms are made by human hands, Robin. None of them is infallible. It is a lesson that must be faced."" Batman: ""Nobody wants war."" Robin: ""Gee, Batman. Belgravia's such a small country. We'd beat them in a few hours."" Batman: ""Yes, and then we'd have to support them for years."" - Now Ironman quotes:  - Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals. Tony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?  See what I mean? Who would you rather answer the phone at 3 am? A brave, compassionate, logical rodent with wings, or a sexist, insolent, fear mongering hunk of metal? I say the choice is in the sky. Batman 08"	This is obvious propaganda, and those quotes are out of context. The Tony Stark quotes are all from before his change of heart in the movie, lets face it Stark is much more electable than batman. Batman the strong silent type could never be elected president because he does not have public speaking skills. where as Mr stark can stand behind a podium and with just his quick wit have everyone eating out of his hands While i am not one to call batman stupid, but against Stark, who created a reactor the size of a small plate in a cave in the desert, his accomplishments are trivial. With Starks intellect there would be no civil matter he couldn't handle. Balance the budget? NO problem. want a end to national deficit? Vote Ironman If you really want to turn the economy around, if you really want to put an end to war and the defense budget VOTE IRONMAN A ARMY OF ONE!	0
Oh please, go suck a lemon, you might think im sullying the good ol irish stereotype that exists in you head by coming on hear and talking about all the things you love to try to justify or else ignore, like the fact that your government has effectively caused the deaths of apporximately 3 million in the last 20 yrs. You have the cheek to talk about reputation, i can tell you with 100% certainty that what the US did in Iraq (and what you fully supported from what i gather) has decimated your countries reputation even among your supporters overseas, and if North Korea or Iran did it to anyone else you'd vaporise them for it, your country has made hypocrisy a virtual institution. i can gaurantee you if you asked even a reasonable person from a a foreign country outside the west who is more of a danger to world security the government of the US or that of the Islamic Republic of Iran the answer would be the US, and to be honest plenty within europe would provide the same answer Peace out;-)	It was a joke, get a grip.

Please provide evidence for your claim. How do you know that everything has a god in it? Am I a god, are you a god? What in me is evidence of a god?	What in me is evidence of a god? Many would argue the fantastic complexity of your body, but this argument is lost on you. But there are others, albiet possibly weak arguments. I'll list a few with breif descriptions. 1) Vestigial organs. If evolution were true, we'd have loads. But we don't have any. Things thought to be vestigial in the past have been found to have functions. 2) Vestigial DNA. Same argument as above, but this one has semi-less merit. We only know what a fraction of our DNA does, and the rest is considered 'junk', or vestigial. That would be acceptable, except for the presence of Pyknons [1]. 3) Living transitional species. Once again, probably weak, but it would seem that if evolution happened once, it could, and should happen again. But we only see pure species, not to mention wholly developed organs. Such design implies a creator. 3.1) Rebuttal: but our genetic code is so much the same that it implies we had the same ancestors. Counter-rebuttal: My house and the house across the street are probably made from around 99% of the same material, and yet are vastly different constructions. This is due to a designer. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. These aren't solid arguments, but they're a start.	0
It's not that I strongly disagree, but having watched Fate/Stay Night and not being impressed has turned me off from Fate/Zero despite the vast improvement in animation quality. I guess the style of the story isn't my kind of style, though it probably is unfair of me to make this judgment. I haven't even heard of Black Lagoon, though. Even so, I prefer One Piece and Fairy Tail, the latter being the best ongoing lengthy shounen.	That is why I won't touch Fate/Stay Night. Black Lagoon is good, if you like female characters that are not helpless, mafia wars and a lot of guns.	0

The United States is bascially running the Puerto Rician government which is set up just like ours with the 3 branches.Its a commnwealth so they basically have everything a state has.They also don't need any type of passports to come over here so it would be like traveling state to state. So why not make it official and make it a state? If there's a New Mexico why can't there be a New Puerto Rico? Becoming a state would make them pay taxes for the privileges they already have such as food stamps and welfare that they get for free. Sure it would weird on the flag but it's America a lot of things are weird here.	There is nothing wrong with changing the flag or redesigning it, but it would cost a lot of money and what about Puerto Rico? Are they suppose to just give up their flag and accept ours just like that? Besides, making Puerto Rico become a state would completely shatter their economy and require a lot of things.	0

"After that, something we do know about in great detail happened, the Big Bang, which formed our universe. Protostars formed from hydrogen and gravity, then nebula formed, which made new stars and galaxies, and accreted into planets. We are standing upon one such planet. So the universe came about out of nothing (we don't know how, but it did), and the Big Bang created matter out of nothing. That sounds like Creationism to me. As for stars, is there enough gravity in a nearly-uniform hydrogen cloud to form stars? If so, why don't interstellar gas clouds clump into fairly small objects instead of being spread-out. And if nebula formed solar systems, than why is the majority of the hydrogen and helium (the lightest elements) in the center. If gravity was the main factor, wouldn't the heavy elements go to the center and the lighter ones be the ones to form planets? Instead, it seems the opposite has happened--heavy elements stayed out to form planets, while the lighter ones formed the Sun and Saturn. Abiogenesis, which formed many simpler molecules first, until complexity progressed into self-replicating molecules, which grew into hybrids of nucleic acid and enzymes which could reach themselves (ribozymes). Then we would have something like DNA in protocells. Endosymbiont theory deals with the formation of eukaryotic cells. So, basically, non-living matter formed life? Once again, that seems like Creationism. Look at Ebonics and Singlish as examples. Ebonics seems like slang--a simplified version of English. Singlish is a mixture of languages, and I assume they didn't choose the most complex parts of each language to be in there. languages naturally evolve and diverge from each other. I don't argue with this. I know languages change. But they tend to get more simple. Latin and it's offspring have full conjugation, whereas the much younger English doesn't. ""I go, you go, he goes, we go, y'all go, and they go."" The verb 'go' has been conjugated, but they're all the same. In older languages, the verbs differ."	"So the universe came about out of nothing (we don't know how, but it did), and the Big Bang created matter out of nothing. That sounds like Creationism to me. If the universe has a flat geometry, and dark matter occupies a certain level, then it is very possible that our universe was a quantum fluctuation. The big bang deals with the formation of the universe however, so however it began, it is proceeded by the big bang. Creationism just invokes magic with no understanding of nature. As for stars, is there enough gravity in a nearly-uniform hydrogen cloud to form stars? Your key word is ""nearly."" In a mostly uniform universe any area out of balance is susceptible to accretion due to gravity. If so, why don't interstellar gas clouds clump into fairly small objects instead of being spread-out. Because being pulled towards a center pulls matter near the thing being pulled with it. And if nebula formed solar systems, than why is the majority of the hydrogen and helium (the lightest elements) in the center. They aren't. If you observe our solar system, the planets have a distribution of heaviest elements (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) to lightest (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). If gravity was the main factor, wouldn't the heavy elements go to the center and the lighter ones be the ones to form planets? That's what happened. Remember that we are also dealing with orbits caused by gravity which allows for planets to keep from falling into the sun. Instead, it seems the opposite has happened--heavy elements stayed out to form planets, while the lighter ones formed the Sun and Saturn. You're forgetting Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus. So, basically, non-living matter formed life? Once again, that seems like Creationism. Non-living, organic matter. Creationism posits sudden creation from nothing due to magic words. Ebonics seems like slang--a simplified version of English. Singlish is a mixture of languages, and I assume they didn't choose the most complex parts of each language to be in there. Ebonics is a dialect, Singlish is a creole, which is a pidgin which has been nativised. Slang is the formation of new, trendy words, I suspect that it becomes a dialect when slang and manners of speaking stick beyond just one generation. But they tend to get more simple. You really need to qualify this. Latin and it's offspring have full conjugation, whereas the much younger English doesn't. ""I go, you go, he goes, we go, y'all go, and they go."" The verb 'go' has been conjugated, but they're all the same. In older languages, the verbs differ. Words and conjugations change. It doesn't make the language simple.

Let me get it back. I didnt mean to interfere with your conversation with the other debater.. but... You're assuming that everyone believes the stories of the Bible. So you're assuming that everyone doesnt believe it? There is so much evidence showing that the Bible is not a reliable source of information, that we can't take anything is says at face value. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that we evolved, and that the story of Adam and Eve never actually happened.  Yes, if you studied, then you'd know that it is not really reliable at all. Not all people take everything the Bible says, even other Catholics disproce of the things that are written there. As for the Adam and Eve, what if they lived in our past, and they existed, but then, we never knew that they were Adam and Eve because people changed their names?   Even many Christian religions have come to accept this given the overwhelming amount of evidence supporting evolution. I think we would be going to far off topic if we start debating evolution, but if you want to I can create a new debate about it. Yes, Im a Catholic.. and most of my teachers are scientists, but still, they accept the thought of having a religion. I dont understand why others dont. Even Albert Einstein accepted that there is a higher being that is governing our universe.	"So you're assuming that everyone doesn't believe it? No, some people believe, some don't. I was trying to explain that ""gays that don't really care for God, the bible, and etc."" want to get married because they don't believe the god of the Bible created marriage.  As for the Adam and Eve, what if they lived in our past, and they existed, but then, we never knew that they were Adam and Eve because people changed their names?  We can come up with an infinite number of ""what if"" scenarios, but that doesn't mean any of them should be taken seriously if they have nothing to back them up, and since all the evidence for evolution points to the story of Adam and Eve being false, there is no reason to take it seriously. most of my teachers are scientists, but still, they accept the thought of having a religion. I don't understand why others don't. One of the reason most scientists are not religious is because the evidence for a god is very weak, and science is based on evidence. Most religious belief is based off of personal experiences and feelings, both of which are notoriously unreliable ways to determine truth. Members of The National Academy of Sciences, who are regarded as the brightest scientists in the nation, are 72.2% atheist and and 20.8% agnostic. That means only 7% of our nations smartest people believe in a god. In the UK’s Royal Society, which is similar to the National Academy of Sciences, only 3.3 percent believe in God. These are people who have spent their lives studying and researching how the universe works. They probably have a better understanding of it that any of us will have in our lifetimes, so I choose to put my trust in them instead of a 2000 year old book that you yourself said is ""not really reliable at all."" Here is the study about scientists and belief in god if you're interested <a href='http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html'>http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html  Even Albert Einstein accepted that there is a higher being that is governing our universe. This is a common misconception. Here is what Einstien said about god. ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.""

Different people in different professions may have the same political ideology, however you will find different distributions of political ideology in different types of professions.  Two different ideologies don't have to be mutually exclusive. For example, many communists support a period of regulated capitalism. My original statement was that a state's values only oppose another ideology if the state's values are ones that only consider a narrow band of ideas plausible. For example if a state has a value of monogamy, then it would consider any non-monogamy as counter to it but if a state values relationships in general then it would not. A different meaning than how you interpreted the original statement.  How do you know if its a good idea unless it is challenged/tested?	"Which is why totalitarian states will so heavily indoctrinate in order to keep everyone on the same page. If a communist is putting forth a capitalistic stance, then he is being antagonistic to communism. Being a polygamist in a state that values relationships is not being diverse from that value, so it's not relevant to this debate. Interesting that you added ""/tested"" to this question. You did it so you could sneak in ""challenged"", which is not necessary for proving if an idea could work, with ""tested"" since that is the method for proving an idea could work. A good idea unchallenged is still a good idea."	0

Don't think I'm telling you you're wrong, because it's idiotic to say someone's opinion is wrong, but think about this hypothetical please. Say you were a lower class citizen, to the point where you weren't able to put food on the table some nights. You pay your taxes, because you're a good citizen but then you become deathly ill and the hospital services cost more than you make in a week. Would you want your tax money that you gave for others who might need it to be used at this moment? It's an ideal of a community of sharing. I accept that you would rather not share, because I too want to be stingy sometimes, but if it could save your life later, wouldn't it be good to share?	It's an ideal of a community of sharing. I accept that you would rather not share, because I too want to be stingy sometimes, but if it could save your life later, wouldn't it be good to share? It would be sharing, if I actually had a choice in the matter. Forced sharing can't be called sharing anymore - it's theft. I think people should be able to choose what services they want and what services they don't want - while you may not want to risk your health for the sake of monetary increase, many people would take that chance. Just like some people choose to smoke regardless of the risks involved.  If the taxes weren't so damn high, then your hypothetical low class worker would not only have enough money to feed himself, but he'd be able to save money too for these occasions.  It's an ideal of a community of sharing. I accept that you would rather not share, because I too want to be stingy sometimes, but if it could save your life later, wouldn't it be good to share? But my problem is that it is not sharing, it is involuntary wealth distribution. I'm forced to sustain people I don't know and don't care about - whereas I could use that money to sustain myself, my family and my friends or in otherwords, the people I do care about.	0

I understand the argument for a gold standard, I think that it won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now through. I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking, which is one of our main issues and has more to do with inflation than anything. But that is another debate.  Lets return to the original idea that if everyone started using gold for currency, its value would decrease. At face value, yes you would expect its value to actually increase under such a situation. And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on. Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc. The point I merely wish to make is that there are multiple processes which go on, some which raise the value due to increase demand, and others which are often less in magnitude and take longer to have effect, which lower the value due to increase in demand.	"""I think that [the gold standard] won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now"" It is a fallacy to think that the globe must have a billion to pay back a billion because it neglects the temporal component of capital and interest. Focusing solely on the financial and accounting, it is entirely possible to pay back a billion with the ENTIRE monetary supply limited to a million. Each payment is a million, until the full billion is repayed. This would be a 1000 term repayment. The economic analysis of this must include the time component of interest and depreciation. And money is only a symbol. Inflation and all this funny money corrupts the symbol and introduces the ""slippery slope"" fallacy into the markets; purchasing power. It is precisely the stability of the money which encourages economic growth. If you think we have growth now, growth with a stable currency would be absolutely mind boggling. With the blessing of the stable currency/money, one can plan extremely long range; ie 99 year leases. ""Money is a good servant, but a bad master"".

Well I think you meant to devastate Soviet Union's economic not the whole of Soviet Union. It did devastate the people's lives as they lived in poor living conditions and were tortured as you said.	how the heck is tat a rebuttal? thx for agreeing :):):):)	0

You are wrong. I am fine with people disagreeing. Just ask my nonjewish friends. I just have no tolerance for bullshit.	Ok first of all you were a Christian a few weeks ago, I'm pretty sure. Secondly I'm not asking your friends anything, your previous attitude isn't something that speaks of who you truly are. If what I was saying is so intolerant, you should have the grace to point out the flaws in my argument- like most people on this site	0
So these people vote on who's skilled? Sounds like a popularity contest.	To a lesser extent than if the general public does it. I wonder what actually goes through the head of someone when they elect one of these people.

Oh, so He created is in His image except for those parts that He didn't create in His image, cool.	God created us to reflect Himself: He created us so that we may rule and care for the world, as He does all of reality. There is more to it, but this is the main point that needs to be said here. He did not give us omnipotence, nor omniscience, nor moral perfection. We are merely reflections, not the actual thing.	0

Have you ever been with people who were on drugs? I have, for quite some time. It can causes birth defects in children and irreversible brain damage, etc.	During high school, some of my good friends smoke weed everyday, and they so became no friends of my anymore, yet I chose the alternative of drug free. Drug Free programs should be geared towards choice rather than the causes. Despite the causes, the effects of drug prohibition is no less of alcohol or cigarettes.  What about the principles?	0
If God is willing to have universal health care, but is not able, then He is not omnipotent. If He is able, but not willing, then He is malevolent. If He is able and willing, then whence come evil? If He is neither able nor willing, then why call him God?	You make a logical argument challenging God's existence. That said, assuming His existence and that He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, what is your answer?	0
Though phobias exist, it is quite difficult to assess whether they are real fears or if the phobic is acting. I could easily convince anybody that I had a phobia (I've experience with arachnophobia), but that doesn't mean that I actually have it. Even if it is deemed a valid excuse, what if I said I had a fear of going to work. Would I get some sort of disability payment? It's simply an excuse for laziness.	DISPUTE! I have a terrifying fear of cockroaches. Just cockroaches, I'm fine with other insects and I love reptiles ... but I am scared to death of cockroaches. Well Didaskaleinophobia would only be associated with someone who is at a young age, an age where a phobia is likely due to the environment that school is. There is a numerous amount of kids who end up being home schooled as the school environment is traumatizing to them.  However as an adult a phobia like Didaskaleinophobia should be outgrown therefore a phobia like a fear of going to work shouldn't be viable. As the brain has had time to develop into the mind of an adult. Whereas some might never grow out of such a phobia most should, and hypothetically will.	0
Can the living God who created heaven and earth lie? Is He cruel and does He like to trick us? Can the one who took the concept of a human being and wrote it genetic code not use language to communicate something that is accurate to us? If He can write a genetic code I seriously doubt He would have a hard time writing something as simple as a book. Is the creator of language unable to communicate using language? Is that omnipotent being incapable of preserving His word. Seriously, if there is a problem with God's word it should be logically obvious that the problem lies with us and not God. Because how does an omniscient being make a mistake? And we all know that we make errors in thinking and judgment all the time.	Can the living God who created heaven and earth lie? Is He cruel and does He like to trick us? Earth and the heavens were not created, however, so it is a lie to attribute them to a god. Can the one who took the concept of a human being and wrote it genetic code not use language to communicate something that is accurate to us? If He can write a genetic code I seriously doubt He would have a hard time writing something as simple as a book. The genetic code and the human race were not created either.

People with no desire to live, but a desire to avoid pain would obviously find ways to commit suicide without inflicting pain to themselves. A heroin overdosis would probably serve this purpose.	You can have no desire to live, but still be afraid to die. And not be afraid because you don't want to die, but because you don't know what being dead is like.  I have no desire to live, but I am afraid of the unknown.	0
Your wrong. Witchcraft is a type of religion because it shares fundamental similarities between all covens and practices. They are a lot like the difference between roman Catholics and Christians. Same fundamental beliefs but, different ways of viewing it. Wicca is the core name behind all witchcraft weather it be dark magic, necromantic, green, or white. They all follow the same basic principals and call themselves something different. The religion is the witchcraft though and its more personal then it is indoctrinated.	"You are wrong. Witchcraft is a group of religion, and it is ""you're"", not ""your""."	0

As people in the cities become busier, the younger generation of urban civilians is getting used to eat out in restaurants and cafés and forget about the numerous ob benefits and joy of eating at home. Most workers who live in the city don't have enough time to eat healthy and cook at home. So they think it's better to save time. But also there are some disadvantages of eating out.  Firstly, eating at home people can enjoy communicating with family, sharing their everyday experiences, news, feelings. So the family becomes more close-knit, friendly and harmonious. For example in Italy there is a tradition when every Sunday all family gather together, visit their parents and have dinner in order to communicate, to share their company. to visit their parents and have dinner together. So Italians values the family traditions very high and cooking and having dinner with the family is very important part of their life. In the restaurant as usual people go with a company of a friend, colleagues or just alone.	Another reason why it is better to eat out is the wide range of choices. Sometimes when cooking at home we could be stuck with only recipes we know, and even then we have to make sure that all the ingredients are available. But, it is more satisfying and adventurous going to a new restaurant and trying something new.	0
Again, you insult your own integrity by grossly misrepresenting what I have said. I have already acknowledged my understanding that most Christians are well-intentioned when they say Merry Christmas. In fact, that was the very first thing that I wrote. My express point was that there is a difference between intention and actuality. One can mean well and still be insensitive and intolerant.  My argument is not and never has been that anyone should stop saying Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays altogether, but that they should not go around saying it people they do not know and frequently have never even met because of the oppressive history religion does have.  I also never suggested that greeting cards should be altered, or asked that they acknowledge the oppressive history of religion. I could honestly care less what the religious send to one another.  My statement that atheists are trusted less than rapists is not hyperbole. Please do some research; you can start <a href='http://digitaljournal.com/article/315425'>here. If an atheist elects to be open about their non-belief, and I do, then discrimination is a guarantee.  I never stated that I have any strong emotion on this issue, let alone rage. I presented a calm, rational breakdown of the historical influence of religion substantiated by facts and reason to demonstrate why my stance has a legitimate basis. Asking that people tolerate my non-belief is not being religiously intolerant. At no point have I suggested that the religious should be silenced, discriminated against, or otherwise treated unfairly. All I have argued is that people not assume I am religious and ignore the negative impact religion has had on my life and the lives of others. That does not seem unreasonable to me.	Outrage is not the same as rage. Rapists are sex offenders so they are put on a list, due to them not being trusted. No such list for atheists. I have never seen religion come up in my professional affairs and very few of my personal ones. Hence I have not been discriminated against. The idea of goodwill toward man involves strangers. That's why holiday wishes are a statement about the wished. Shall I ask your religion before I greet you? I just don't want to offend.	0
Well i cant say yes wholeheartedly though it is the best gun i know of. I say a history channel special on it. It's really rugged and tough to break or jam. Has great fire rate and power. Can be field stripped and repaired in a very short amount of time. And is clearly the favorite of many countries. The only thing it suffers in is accuracy and its not even that bad. Plus i love it in MW3 ;)	"Haha you love it on Modern Warfare 3 (the game) that's probably why you would think it's the best firearm overall ever made. In my opinion it most certainly isn't the best in modern warfare (in reality). They were surprisingly cheap to buy which is why they were so often the weapon of choice in guerrilla war. So yeah it could have been and I'm sure would have been the favored firearm for those who used it after its design was perfected in the last years of WWII as it has many advantages such as the simple design, its relatively light weight, most importantly for those who use it is that it as you quite rightly said ""really rugged and tough to break or jam"" which is why it's reliable and very well known up to this day. Oh and... It looks nice with that lovely smooth woodgrain (in my opinion) hehe. However I don't think it's the best overall firearm, maybe on your game it is but 'ever made' I can't agree as there have been many firearms since the Kalashnikov."	0
You're missing something. What? Or maybe he claims it'll take two terms because he want to be reelected? Its possible. So is his original claim. The verity of his claims are open to debate. Ok ...? So his claims could still be true and or false. Still doesn't change that he was elected for his ideals o.O I didn't say he isn't doing anything; I said that, if somebody better comes along, then the better man should win. How can one determine the better man? Especially since that same man isn't going to change anything any faster than Obama, the verity of that claim is debatable as well. Only it could go vice versa or Obama could go 10 times faster than this supposed new guy, or the other way around! You just don't know. He'll be there soon. And in order to complete the goal he got elected for he needs the second term.	"Its possible. So is his original claim. Yet, knowing politicians, I'd go with my claim over yours.

Oh there is persecution in America but its slowly coming and I can see it. Christians are being slowly persecuted in America because of people bullying other Christians in schools, out at workplaces , on tv shows such as Family Guy, and American Dad, our views on a lot of the political things such as gay marriage which a lot of people persecute us on that view and the list goes on.	Family Guy, and American Dad, Those shows do that to pretty much all major religions. 	0
I don't remember Jesus advocating pedophilia, human sacrifice, woman and child beating, murder, mahem, eating people, etc. I sense sarcasm. Jesus advocates child abuse: Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: “He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.” Matthew 15:4-7 Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he’ll give your a big reward. Jesus asks that his followers abandon their children to follow him. To leave your child is abuse, it’s called neglect, pure and simple. Matthew 19:29 Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law. Mark 7:9 Luke 12:47 Jesus okays beating slaves.	"My Bible says: Matthew 15:4-7 For God said 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses father or mother shall die.' But you say,'Whoever says to father or mother, ""Any support you might have had from me is dedicated to God,"" need not honor his father.' You have nullified the word of God for the sake of your traditions. Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said: According to Leviticus 20:9 ""Anyone who curses his father or mother shall be put to death; since he has forfeited his life.  Mosaic law prescribes this punishment. Jesus is a man who follows the law he will not break it. There are punishments for crimes. He doesn't talk about outright murdering offspring, if they deserve punishment it will be rendered by God. Matthew 19:29 And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life. One children and wives were property so they could be given to someone else to take care of. Two Jesus is just naming family members so he means fullgrown ones. Families tended to live together back then so he was just leaving a group of a lot of people to follow Jesus. They can watch each other. Mark 7:9 He went on to say, ""How well you have set aside the commandment of God in order to uphold you tradition! Mark 7:10-11 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall die.' Yet you say, 'If a person says to father or mother, ""Any support you might have had from me is qorban""' Which means that children that dedicate their money to and talents to God instead of helping their needy parents, when the parents can no longer help themselves, should be killed for his lack of charity that is required by Mosaic law. Luke 12:35-48 ""Gird your loins and light your lamps and be like servants who await their master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself, have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them. And should he come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way, blessed are those servants. Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour when the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come."" Then Peter said, ""Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?"" And the Lord replied, ""Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to distribute (the) food allowance at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so. Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property. But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, to eat and drink and get drunk, then that servant's master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful. That servant who knew his master's will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely; and the servant who was ignorant of his master's will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly. Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more. This is talking about the rapture. It's a parable a metaphor. You can't take scripture out of context like a Jehovah's Witness.    Character attacks on a flawless man are not cool."	0

Claims need evidence. Just because there is no evidence for disproving or proving a claim does not make it equal faith. For example, is it more likely that the greek gods exist. this cannot be disproved or proved. Same with the claim that unicorns live in the adromeda galaxy; yet, we can say with confidence that in all likeliness, there are no unicorns in the adromeda galaxy or an alien name bob who enjoys to make alcohol.	For starters, atheism is less a claim and more of a rejection of a claim which does not have evidence. Atheism rejects the claim of theism precisely because there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. Atheism is what you get when you refuse to believe a claim that cannot be proven. Taking on your irrational demand for evidence, however, there is significant research that indicates some humans have a greater predisposition towards faith and theistic belief and which identifies faith as a biological byproduct of the human mind; this discredits the likelihood that theology is anything more than a human construction.	0
Freedom of belief is a right. .	"I believe the exact language use in the Constitution is ""freedom of Religion"" being that you have the right to be any religion that you chose.

I'd rather have homework because you have to do too much for a project. Homework is not as important as a project. Well it is but if you miss one homework assignment it's not as bad as missing a whole project so that's why I say homework.	True that homework is not as important, but the total workload of homework totals to more than the total workload of the project, and through out the year, there is more chance of you forgetting homework than there is you forgetting a project and the total number of points you can get from homework throughout the year is much greater than the amount you can get from projects as they occur less often.	0
Compare the laws, gay people have limited marriage rights, str8 people may marry where ever when ever, gay people use rights to there advantage all the time but I guess you fail to see that. I have gone into a law/rights book, I compared both gay rights and str8 rights. It seems that str8 people have more rights then homosexuals do. Don't believe me? examples: Straights can and gays can-not. 1. children, adoption. 2. free legal marriage any where in the USA even religions go against the homosexuals, they say they shouldn't even be in some religions, only the religions that go against it. (I know this may have nothing to do with it I just thought I would add that in)	First of all, straight people don't get a pass when it comes to adoption. There are certain requirements that must be met. Those requirements apply to gays as well. Again, gays can marry anyone they want, anywhere they want, whenever they want (as long as it is someone of the opposite sex). If certain religions don't accept gays, gays are free to start their own religion. If there are other countries that allow same sex marriages, then gays are free to go live there. This isn't communist China.	0
'This is written in a manner which leads me to believe that you do not believe in the existence of free will.' so it never occurred to you that i don't believe in any god? 'free will' in the theological sense is an excuse. that's not to say that ppl cant do whatever the hell they want to do. but our ability to make decisions doesn't have anything to do with a 'god allowing us' to do so, or 'not wanting us to be robots.'  'Why couldn't God violate an individual's free will to make a point?' because that is logically inconsistent with the assertion that god cannot (or does not) violate free will. if god could violate Pharaoh's free will to give himself an excuse to kill all Egypt's first born, he could violate the 'free will' of all child molesters to make sure no child was ever again molested. and in doing so, he would be beginning to solve 'the problem of evil'. 'the problem of evil' is only a problem because theists contended that god is all powerful, all knowing, and all loving. these qualities are directly contradicted by the persistence of 'evil'. one cannot be all loving, all powerful and indifferent to the suffering of untold millions of children.  the fact that i need to explain all this, puts a particularly humorous spin on your totally unnecessary snipe, citing 'uneducated corruptors'. but thanks for asking.	so it never occurred to you that i don't believe in any god? Determinism is by its very nature theistic. because that is logically inconsistent with the assertion that god cannot (or does not) violate free will. If God cannot do so then he is not omnipotent, something which conflicts with the notion of a deism.  one cannot be all loving, all powerful and indifferent to the suffering of untold millions of children. Why not?	0

"I have to disagree. It sounds like you're in favor of the Bush Doctrine (correct me if I'm wrong) of attacking any nations that might pose a threat. This idea of being a military based society that attacks other nations out of self-interest without regard to the civilian populations is the main reason there are terrorists that hate us. If genocide is happening, get an international coalition and kill the mother fucker responsible. I think you overestimate the number of ""genocidal maniacs"" though.  Otherwise diplomacy, and working with other nations to seek peaceful solutions to problems that are not yet violent would be a great way to prevent violent conflicts in the future.

You are out of your mind! See you and the public think china has no navy no airforce etc. But the us military knows. The report recently released by the chinese relation committee said that so far China has an equal number of frigates, a couple more destroyers and actually an equal number of subs. But thats just the tip of the iceberg! They have stolen all blue prints of our f-35 22's, stealth ships, the list is never ending, They are back engineering everthing we have as we speak. But hold on cause cause im just getting started. They have been selling our military microchips that we use in everthing from sattalite guided missles to our fighter jets. These chips have a back door built in each one that allows the peoples liberation army to remotely control and interrupt these weapon systems. Speaking of sattaites, as you may have guessed they've hacked into our military sattalites and even breifly took control and placing malware that could lead to future disrruptions. Our electrical infrastructure has been breached and back doors have been placed along it that could be used in time of war to disrupt the system. China and russia have conducted multiple sea based excercises! Russia has been conducting submarine patrols up and down the east coast even comingbwithin 12 miles of breachin us airspace with strategic bombers during july 4 2012. Yea russia and china not a threat. Connect the dots! An invasion is in the works and its a slow process, of course we will be totally caught off gaurd. Wondering when did they get here?

it doesn't explain HOW it happened, just what was needed. all we've proven is that scientist are able to create life... almost. we haven't discovered how life was created in the first place, though.	Obviously life can't be explained in a few experiments. There are several of them. These 2 new developments in tandem with experiments in the past should collectively prove life's formation. We have: 1. Replicated, mapped, created (in various parts with relatively simple methods to that of most technology today), anything-else-ed life in various forms. 2. There is an extensive fossil record with plenty of transitional fossils. 3.

Some investigations have revealed that the increasing significance of computers in the twenty-first century for socio-economic evolution is one of the master factors behind the addiction to computers and their using in private and public places. A lot of people consider that computers make our life much easier and convenient whereas other people think that this kind of technology drives us into the frame. nowadays people prefer sending text-massages to each other instead of talking face to face, and this is a shame, because it is one of the reasons which may allow us to say that we are losing our humanity. In modern society there is no place where somebody can go outside without his device. If computer becomes the main object of a human’s life, this person’s behavior changes; he becomes “lazy and develop anti-social tendencies” and often can’t do anything without help of computer. But behavioral changes are not the only negative side of computer dependency, there is also another one and not less important, when person is unable to stop using computer, it can take a toll on his comfort and health.	i like what you said about where humans created it. that shows that we are incontrol of everything. we are incontrol of technology. we are incomtrol of our selves we made it not the other way around......enough said	0
But if that is true doesn't that mean that you can fall in love with anybody ... and everybody? and if you fall in love with everybody then 'true love' does not exist.	"No it does not mean that. If you don't like a lot of things about someone then you don't force yourself to like them. If there is a lot of things you don't agree with and a lot of misunderstandings then you are simply incompatible and true love could not surface anyway. That's also why i said ""petty flaws"". Many flaws would not be petty."	0

However Jiu Jitsu, as expressed through debate is paying due respect to conflicts before things turn violent. How does one express Jui Jitsu though debate?	In seriousness, in playfulness, and in doing as little harm (As our skills allow) to an opponent. In a Jiu Jitsu match, the aim is to strengthen one another, and encourage those less skilled to keep practicing rather than to give up. Nice question.	0

What about the Twins,  even when they were surronded by jack's influence, they did whatever they could to help Ralph, puting themselves at risk.  It would have been reasonable to stay quiet and protect themselves, but they desired to do the right thing and help him.  Yes there are some evil desires, but that does not make desire as a whole a evil thing.	Right, the twins could be considered good guys, but they were the exception. The majority of the kids eventually went along with Jack. Not all people are evil, just most. And I never said desire as a whole was evil.	0
Being of sound mind, I realize I'm likely to get as much enjoyment debating a person who advocates the murder of children and refers to them and their mothers as property as I would playing chess with a person afflicted with Down syndrome, but still I have to ask; what is your methodology for determining what parts of the Bible are metaphoric and what parts are not?	Every atheist I have ever encountered does not understand the Bible; the Old Testament only applies to the Jews, whereas the New Testament applies to both Christians and Jews.	0
Since I am using an iPad, I am using an on screen keyboard AND typing. Also, Obama could still be the cause before being born because he is the ANTI-CHRIST.

Provide proof that he is the ANTI-CHRIST.	0
"Ok ""politics has nothing to do with a battle"" I am just going to toss over my shoulder and tell you to read art of war, or the five rings, or the CIA freedom fighter's manual, or any successful book concerning war. They can tell you why you are wrong so much better than I can. Bad administration is very often why armies fall. . Also artillery is not as damaging as what they used to do. Greeks had a bad habit of, after destroying farmland, spoiling the soil. There are a number of ways to do this, but salt or oil after burning are popular tools. I've heard of something extensive as dumping the top soil in the ocean as well, but that one seems like it may be more myth than fact. If real at all, a last ditch solution at best. . I think the Romans adopted this practice of ruining the soil like that, but I won't say they did because I don't know for sure. . Point is it kills the roots of anything you plant for decades to come. With out modern technology you have to simply wait for the problem to fix itself and Nature is slow. . And lets assume for a moment 100% of the land that was recovered. They still didn't have much land to farm with to begin with (hence the popularization of destroying farmland). Their armor is still made out of money that could have been used to to buy horses, ships, or fortification. They are still a distrustful political patch work. They still wouldn't use captured Roman items if they had iron in them since iron was seen as disgraceful. They even had a villain who's name translated into club man, who was looked down on for having an iron rod he beat people with."	I've read the art of war, you do know Sun Tzu was advocating peace when he wrote that? Plus politics in an individual battle means nothing, there's only life or death. Also Rome salted Carthage after obliterating it.	0
Cod and Halo are geared towards anyone over 18. Video games in general have no target audience. Anyone can play. MLP is targeted SPECIFICALLY at girls ages 1-10ish. If not that then just females in general. When a grown fucking man watches something like that, how can you not call homo? I'm all for women's equality. Play video games, drive monster trucks, own companies, play football, whatever. But grown ass males should NOT be watching My Little Pony. And at the very damn least, not watch it and then wonder why everyone is calling you a faggot. I'm not homophobic. I just personally see this as a stupid, childish, and in some cases disturbing act that needs to, at the very least, stop being praised.	"You don't think that the majority of video games aren't geared towards guys? You proved that you do by putting video games in with the list of things that women do that makes them equal to men. You were right that anyone can play but when advertised these type of games are aimed towards boys. I am all for girls doing anything a guy can do but should go both ways, guys can't do anything girls can do too.  It's sexist, and narrow-minded to judge any guy who enjoys ""girly"" things."	0
I think it goes without saying, but its still no paradise. And we shouldnt have gone there.	"It certainly does not go without saying. Saddam was a brutal dictator who murdered anyone who, in his paranoid delusions, posed a threat to his regime. But, under his ""reign of terror"", women enjoyed far more equality than they do today, and the country was considered safe enough to do business with, bringing in foreign capital. Also, during his reign, he murdered far fewer people than have been killed since through sectarian violence, not even counting the people who died in the war. Our military is the greatest engine of destruction the world has ever known (I mean that in a good way), and they are very good at targeting that destruction on military targets and minimizing civilian casualties, but as a force for nation building, it, and we, totally suck."	0
And love needs a godly source? Isn't it more beautiful to think that love just is? That it is more pure and created from your parents and dog than from god?	I guess I just believe that everything has a source. :)	0
Actually America does have an official language, English. meaning that Puerto Rico would have to make English their primary language also.

The senate tried to make English the official language of the United States a couple of times and it was rejected."	0

"Thats not necessarily the definition of ""discrimination"" it is more complex than that. Discrimination is societies persecution of victims, not simple opposition. Black people opposed what white people did during the civil rights movement of the late 50s/early 60s does that mean black people were discriminating against whites? HELL NO!"	What do you call discrimination? The definition calls it the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things based on yada yada, you know the rest. When people are treated unfairly, be that as being turned down from a job opportunity or mocked and shamed on a social media site, that is discrimination. No one group is being discriminated against.	0

Just like Hinduism, witchcraft is a group of religions, not a religion.	Your wrong. Witchcraft is a type of religion because it shares fundamental similarities between all covens and practices. They are a lot like the difference between roman Catholics and Christians. Same fundamental beliefs but, different ways of viewing it. Wicca is the core name behind all witchcraft weather it be dark magic, necromantic, green, or white. They all follow the same basic principals and call themselves something different. The religion is the witchcraft though and its more personal then it is indoctrinated.	0
It wasn't sudden. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ancient_Egypt'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ancient_Egypt   According to Encounters, one of many magazines in my paranormal collection, the pyramids went from shoddily designed and with little mathematical accuracy to the most complex of engineering and mathematics for thousands of years.

If you're talking about the second to last video, it didn't impress me. Our government pours billions into military research and unusual technologies are the product of that. However the real indicators of falsehood to me are statements like ""anti-gravity"" or other scientific mistakes. If a video suggests alien technology that defies physics or biology, it's most likely bogus. Besides all this, I've never encountered anything suspicious in classified military and political documents I've read that would corroborate the claims of this video. This actually brings up yet another point, I can easily access military and government top secret documents, but if the government is SO GOOD and hiding things, why was I able to recently read about the methodology our government uses to torture people or the tactics encouraged when our operatives need to destabilise a foreign power from within? You'd think top secret documents would be, you know, a little more secret."	0
Seriously! More than half of the marijuana smokers I know are highly philosophical, highly motivated people; and, if you were wondering, California is considering legalizing for economic reasons. And, when it comes down to it, it’s so easy to get marijuana, it might as well be legal. Like sex or alcohol/cigarettes for minors, marijuana is so easy to get, the government would be better off legalizing to regulate and protect.	Most of the smokers I know are motivated too, but not to the end of making marijuana legal. They're motivated in their day-to-day lives. They work hard, keep clean houses, etc. And they're philosophical in terms of sitting around and having an intense debate about issues that matter. But when it comes down to it, of all the smokers I know, only one besides myself has actually fought in any way for reform of marijuana laws.	0
I stand by the argument that everything needs some form of regulation, because human behaviour is always unpredictable, weird and at times precarious and dangerous.  But as with all regulation, there are costs, it will probably inhibit alot of good things that people are doing out there as well as their creativity which is practically nourishment for the internet, but some thought needs to be given to that. I guess SOPA would be such an example.	It is already regulated. If it is suspected laws are being broken, they only need obtain a search warrant. I do not believe the desire to control stems from catching criminals. I suspect there are other motives.	0
First, Oprah is worth more than 2.5 billion dollars. However, this debate is not about money, yet you continue down that path. It is about control. You accuse the Republicans that they are controllers, yet the liberal side is just as controlling if not more. Liberals have an imperious intelligence superiority where they believe that they are always right, and those who disagree are inherently always wrong. So, in order for yourself to feel better, you use insult tactics such as you live in lala land despite the fact that you unquestionably listen and adore the likes of the liberal elite without question of which as mention before, Keith Oberlmann, Nancy Grace, Chris Matthews, Oprah Winprah, Anderson Copper, and Rachel Maddows.	"1. I don't like Oprah, I think she's a scavanger. 2. The point is, you use ""liberal elite"" as if it exists. My point is it doesn't, and if anyone can be accused of undo control over public opinion it is the right... death panels, Obama wasn't born here, Constitutional rights being taken away, black panthers on the rise, Acorn helping a pimp, etc etc. These are all right wing, completely made up conspiracies paid for and financed by those who benefit the most from things like deregulation. They lie to you, you believe them, you act and vote in ways against your own self-interest because of these lies. If it is about control, and you are against being controlled, stop spewing your right wing ideology."	0
why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? I'm not disagreeing with you, but could it be that we are afraid of what will happen? If you have always grown up around a group of people and one day meet up with another group, you will judge the new group by stereotypes that you've always heard.	I'm not disagreeing with you, but could it be that we are afraid of what will happen? If you have always grown up around a group of people and one day meet up with another group, you will judge the new group by stereotypes that you've always heard. If a person has nothing but negative or frightening stereotypes by which to judge a group, then yes, they might very well be afraid or hostile upon meeting a member of that group. That is now prejudice is passed on. A person who grows up in a diverse setting will have previous exposure (both positive and negative) to more groups. Even if they do not apply what they learned from their varied experiences to unfamiliar groups, such an upbringing would result in more tolerance for other groups.	0
And this is why i reported you as Prodigy. .	The reason you reported me is because you feel for Hellno's bullshit lol	0
handguns are not as accurate as rifles. in fact, revolvers are considered mini-rifles because they're the only handguns that have any true accuracy. plus, it's always important to have an equal hand to those out there who will always have access to the most powerful weapons (criminals and the government). plus, a handgun won't stop a line backer on PCP, unless we're talking an semi-automatic magnum.	Okay you win. I did not take into account the threat of a line backer on PCP. Clearly you have thought this one through. But trust me when I say that there are accurate handguns out there.	0
How so?

"There are a lot of logical arguments for stupid design- the physical fallibility of the human body (breathing/eating from one hole=suffocation) making it easy for us to needlessly die, which therefore leeches at the legitimacy that we were made by something ""intelligent""."	"There are a lot of logical arguments for stupid design- the physical fallibility of the human body (breathing/eating from one hole=suffocation) making it easy for us to needlessly die, which therefore leeches at the legitimacy that we were made by something ""intelligent"". This line of reasoning appears to be confusing perfect design with intelligent design. Just because there are some minor setbacks does not mean the design, as a whole, is inadequate. If having those body parts next to each other was really a flaw in the design, then why has the population just continued to increase? If it was really as big a flaw as that line of reasoning is making it out to be, then the human population would be a lot smaller. So I think that that is a terrible argument for stupid design."	0

"This verse is talking about people believing the lies of the ""man of lawlessness"" who does the ""work of Satan,"" not lies that God supposedly tells. You have to be very careful when you read the Bible that you don't take a verse out of context."	In this case, I don't believe the context changes the intended meaning of the quote. The main topic of that passage is what comes before the return of Jesus, and it plainly states that God will spread lies to certain people during that time.	0
I can't stand democracy. The electoral process only breeds deceit. We need either a singular termed presidency, with a nomination ballot, or an office which cannot be voted out of office.

Look at Iraq! Libya!	0
No, I'm afraid you're incorrect. Atheism is faith that not having faith is true.	Actually our philosophy of nat having faith is based on logic. The logic being that faith (meaning belief without evidence/proof) is equal to unjustified belief, and that it is a belief based on absolutely no reason. Also it is not faith being true as much as faith being impractical, you can have faith and be correct, but it would all come down to luck.	0
I would have to disagree with that some of them may have been deists but the rest like George Washington where devout Christians.

So where does the marriage train end? Are we done after legalizing polygamy?	I think that's it. I'm not so interested in legalizing polygamy, I am not against it, but I am certainly not gonna fight for it. I fight for homosexuals, not polygamists. But if and when polygamists are going to be able to marry several people, then I don't think there is any need to legalize anything further. People mention necrophilia and bestiality. But I think when it comes to marriage, the love has to go both ways. There has to be two sides who love each other. With necrophilia the love goes only one way, and the same with bestiality. One can probably claim that his dogs truly loves him - but the dog can not speak for himself, and I don't think it is anyone's right to speak up for him, when they don't know exactly what he is saying.	0
Han Solo has his own music video. Can Captain Malcolm Reynolds say the same?	Yes! Does yours have a dancing furry?	0

Well for one...how can you even prove that everyone has the desire to live? What evidence is there that proves that to be true? Both rhetorical questions. You can't. So your generalization can be dismissed.	The same way that I can prove that objects accelerate with 9.8 meters pr second pr second towards the ground in a vacuum. I observe that objects will move towards the ground in this particular manner in each and every situation. Then I use inductive reasoning to prove that the above statement is a fact.  It's easy to see that people have a desire to live, if no one had that everyone would be killing themselves happily, spontanously and without internal conflict. Since this is wrong in each and every person it must be true in each and every person that they have a desire to live.	0
I don't quite understand your logic on that point. Mind explaining further?	I don't know to make it simpler. If I have the freedom to buy a game then that should extend to being able to choose not to buy a game at all. If I have a freedom to a fountain drink then that means I am FREE to have a fountain drink, not that I HAVE to have one. If I am free to have religion, but I have to have religion, then how is that freedom to religion?	0

Define the term 'just'. Describe the meaning of the phrase 'morally responsible'. If it means what I think it means, then I should imagine that most soldiers - whether the war was just or not - feel responsible for the deaths and the suffering they cause.	The only just cause can be resistance of aggression. Aggression is here the 'use of armed force in violation of someone else's basic rights'. Moral agents bear moral responsibility. Moral agents are capable of reflection, forming intentions and behaving accordingly. The opposite is being determined. If you consider a soldier moral responsible then you believe he is more then just an extension peace of disc ion makers.	0
I don't think countries were turned to slush by artillery in feudal greece, or were turned to slush again just a few decades later, plus european countries are at the top of the HDI so i'd say they've recovered Plus we are talking about Macedon, the rest of greece was always fighting and some city states lived for war.

I've never seen one and, though I've always kept an open mind about everything related to the paranormal and occult, they've never done anything for me. Ghost movies have never frightened me, so I guess subconsciously I've no doubt in their nonexistence.	Interesting.

I will when someone objectively demonstrates any of them. There's a million dollars waiting for the first person who demonstrates and of those first three listed abilities: <a href='http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html'>http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html  Of course it's been waiting there for years... I guess all these people with these abilities just don't want a million dollars.  Yeah, that must be it.	I heard in the 90s that there had been millions of sightings of UFOs - all over the world. UFOs do fall under the 'paranormal' category. There are innumerable accounts of pyrokinesis, psychokinesis, hydrokinesis, human enigmas such as X-Ray vision, magnetism, control over electricity, teleportation, ghosts, ball lightning, alien abductions, 'raining animals', etc. Charles Fort cataloged tens of thousands of these. Ripley came across many, as well. So you, as an 'S' in the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, believe that, if science can't prove it, it mustn't exist. An 'N', by contrast, believes in theoretical possibilities. And so, if science can't verify tens of millions of eyewitness accounts, those tens of millions of people must all be lying.	0
As to the Bible, things that are outside our realm of knowledge, like the Creation. 6 days didn't mean 6 24 hour days. God didn't necessarily create everything like that. And the apocalyptic prophesies like revelation and Ezekiel should not be taken literally. Right, right, I get that you've decided some parts of the bible are to be taken literally and some parts are not, which is the reason I asked you this: What is your methodology for determining what parts of the Bible are metaphorical and what parts are not?	The ones that use metaphor and symbolism. The apocalyptic ones are all symbolism. The creation is symbolism. Almost everything else is pretty good to go.	0
Ninja's don't go proclaiming their presence from the rooftops like pirates do, therefore you cannot tell how many exist today.	Ninjas are outdated. Their techniques, skills, everything. They've been replaced with better warriors with modern training. It's the nature of things. They don't proclaim anything, because there's not enough of them left to do anything. They're chumps by today's standards and they're a dying breed.	0
It's a possibility but an unlikely one in a Western Democracy word would get out and News Organisations would be on it within seconds. In other areas of the world where Democracy doesn't exist I imagine the idea of someone being politically educated wouldn't even see the light of day.	If you read books like 'Manufacturing Consent' you will actually see that there's nothing free about the free media. Frankly, it's pretty well-established that US mainstream media is doing what it can to preserve the status quo, even when that involves ignoring or massively missrepresenting US funded mass murdering, US funded dictatorships.  Take a look at how they have dealt with the NSA scandal. The press immediately shifted focus from the NSA programs to the person behind the leak. Essentially the media has changed the debate from whether the NSA programs were legitimate to whether Snowden is a whisteblower or traitor (something that's completely irrelevant compared to the former). News organisations probably wouldn't cover indoctrination in the slightest.	0

Conquest is in the nature of life. Of human life. Why does one always assume that it would be a 'nature of [alien] life'?	Of human life. Why does one always assume that it would be a 'nature of [alien] life'? No, of life itself. Life, as in all life, attempts to gain dominion over everything else through usage of resources. Bacteria gained dominion over our bodies so that no matter how clean we are, there are still about ten bacterial cells per human cell in you. Plants and insects have competed with each other, shaping each other for each others' needs, which is why we have flowers and bee hives. It is simply how nature works, in that cooperation comes from mutual selfishness being kept in check. There is no reason to assume that alien life would be any different in this respect. The most we could hope for is that their civilisation has used its intelligence to curd these behaviours back, but that's still a tall order.	0

Liberals have lead they way in civil rights, womens rights, privacy rights, and now gay rights. They protect the poor and the elderly with social security, Medicare, and Medicaid and they fight for financial aid and affirmative action programs so that everyone gets the chance at higher education.	Not everybody deserves a chance at a higher education. Only the best should be chosen - not to be chosen so that they have ethnic and religious diversity. I would avoid any place that boasts of ethnic diversity - obviously they can't be expected to be the best. The best would chose people based on their credentials.	0
If a being is X, how can it be anything another than itself? Things don't change: they only emphasis or deemphasize certain characteristics in order to adapt to the environment.	If a being is X, how can it be anything other than itself? Unless he is taught to behave otherwise. Unless codes of society or rules are embedded in his mind. One may be born one way but learns to act the other; leading to confusion no doubt, but would remain no more what he was.	0
It would be the same for a dictator though right? Especially since they don't have much credibility for their power besides military power. Also King Louis XIV is known as the best absolute monarch in history because people actually liked him.	Oh come on, he was a completely ineffective leader, he did absolutely nothing apart form have affairs and out on nice parades, of which he was the center of. The middle class didn't like him they just weren't particularly displeased with him. The lower class, as ever, couldn't give two hoots, they were just too busy staying alive! As a monarch, he may have had absolute power, but he certainly didn't flaunter it!	0

On the battlefield, thinking like that gets you killed. i don't really agree with the quote. In reality, nothing is fair. But that is exactly why War happens.	Well thinking like that results in nasty collateral damage. It's not worth blowing up a building full of 100 civilians to kill 1 enemy combatant. What do you mean nothing is fair?

You said criminals had to be killed, non Christians are saying sorry to the wrong God. And if they do not know better, too bad. And they will be destroyed in time. Terrible morality. How so? You refuse to learn from your mistakes, and instead give them to someone else in exchange for being his eternal suck up. When a Christian, the Holy Spirit enters and gives the Christian a new nature, a nature that fights sin and death. This nature is godly and only produces good fruit. It battles our sinful nature that only produces bad fruit. We learn from our mistakes, and as Paul said in Romans 7, we hate sin, but we do it anyways. And if you really deserve to die, why not to the right thing and die? You also said all people were worthy of the same punishment, so why not take someone with you? I am incapable of saving anyone. So, I make myself a slave to everyone, though I am not a slave to anyone, in order to win as many as possible by the grace of God being shown through my life.	Does God answer your prayers? Do you feel he listens to you?	0
Ya, I'm not sure why most people prefer football either. If it was between football and baseball... which would probably win? (baseball?). My issue is they're both slow sports. Baseball is awfully slow... I end up finding so much free time to direct my attention elsewhere until I end up losing interest in the game... at least until the last few innings, then it's funner to watch. But with football, they always gotta make the strategy, line up, hut, run, catch, run, restart. The best part is right after the um, throw and the running begins, but it's like the shortest lasting part of the whole game. But it might be the whole strategy and body mashing that the guys like it for.	Yeah definitely, us guys and Americans love that body crushing. It's still a tiring sport	0

Iraq did a lot of things wrong, and Saddam Hussein was a bastard...no one is denying that. However, Al Qaeda's presence in Iraq, and the WMD's (which are mysteriously missing), or his attempts to get Uranium, or any of the other reasons that were presented to the American people (or in some cases hidden from) were enough reason to go attack a country that posed little to no immediate threat, and then continue to occupy it. Half a million Iraqis have died! Does that mean anything? If they were breaking U.N. resolutions then it is the U.N's responsibility to take action, not the U.S.'s to act like the international police force.	"they found WMDs, just not NUCLEAR weapons. yes, Saddam was planning on making them, he EVEN SAID SO. and yes, the Uranium was even more proof that he planned on it. the only thing we actually got wrong was that he didn't have nuclear weapons where we looked for them. we did find Chemical WMDs, and plenty of it.  same stuff he used to kill off villages in his own country. half a million Iraqis died... in mostly the same means they have been dying for quite some time now. in fact, the troops fighting this war have been the most well-behaved troops in War History. very few innocents have died at the hands of US troops, and the few that did have died from walking into the middle of a fire fight. Unfortunately, they are so well behaved that they can't even kill anyone who's unarmed... no matter what. it's not even a war... it's policing, they have no rights as a military personal... something about the media beating down on any soldier who shoots a guy who's carrying dynamite, or maybe killing a guy who's running off to warn his friends. half a million iraqis have died because of Insurgents (who still support Saddam) and al-Qaeda (who is doing what Saddam did, kill anyone who does not believe in exactly what they do).  I do believe that the strategy in Iraq has been failed, if we were more brutal and swift with our invasion, we would be done by now, but for some fuckin' reason they didn't do a clean sweep... and it's very unfortunate that they didn't, because we're still fighting now. but going in was not the problem. looking back, yes, we could have handled that problem differently, either through Black Ops (as Cheney proposed before being struck down by the Geneva Convention... we should have gone through with it anyway, fuck them) or through a proper invasion (straight for the heart, fuck everything else)... really, how Lincoln sort of did it when appointing Grant.  and on the UN, the UN should have done something, but they didn't, and based off of everything the US knew, they weren't just going to sit back.

It's possible to believe in a god or gods without believing any of them are infallible or worthy of worship. It's also possible to be an atheist who believes a person or people are worthy of worship, if not infallible.	It's possible to believe in a god or gods without believing any of them are infallible or worthy of worship. Thats what I believe, so what should I call myself since (According to currently popular definitions) I should stop identifying as atheist because I believe gods exist as personality complexes much like what is described in diagnoses of MPD It's also possible to be an atheist who believes a person or people are worthy of worship, if not infallible. So, as I see it, you think it's possible to truly be atheist, while having gods, that you don't refer to as gods,	0

"Hey Jake, welcome back. I can give you numerous instances where Glenn Beck has seen conspiracy plots, or accused people of being Nazis. He also is also blatantly out of touch with reality. Like when he claimed that Fox was the only network showing video of the flotilla raid <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/04/stewart-slams-glenn-beck_n_600486.html'>when every other network had showed it as well (thank you, The Daily Show). If you want more examples I'll be happy to provide. Jake, I never had a problem with conservatives, just ones that are nuts like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh. Some of the things that come out of their mouth's are ridiculous. If you think that all Beck does is ""sit down and review historical facts with common sense"" then you have yourself fooled. I've said it once and I'll say it again: you shouldn't be getting your political opinions from pundits. A pundit show is a show that is meant to appeal to a certain audience and represent a certain viewpoint. The shows secondary job is to present the news. The issue comes when there is a conflict with what the actual news is, and what viewpoint the pundit is advocating. When this happens, the pundit has to either ignore stories, misrepresent stories (a.k.a. lie) or make an appeal to emotion rather than logic (something that Glenn Beck does very well). Pundit shows (both those with liberals and conservatives) make political discourse frustratingly difficult. They merely polarize the political atmosphere and groups can't actually reasonably discuss the issues, but instead resort to talking points and demonizing their opponents (e.g. the liberal elite, or conservative wing-nuts). So that's why I don't like Glenn Beck or almost any pundit for that matter (also he doesn't like soccer)."	lolz I don't care for soccer either. Anyway, I may be a fan of Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but I never said that's where I get my opinions and facts. I look into something before I form an opinion. And believe it or not there have been a few things I have disagreed with Beck and Rush about. So don't worry I don't let others do my thinking for me.  So he was wrong about something. That can be said about just about anyone on TV or radio ..eventually. Especially the daily show.  And the thing about glenn beck is that he jokes around a lot. So people qoute him and say look how CrAZy he iS! Like when he was joking about killing micheal moore.  So yeah give me more examples.  Will you at least, at least admit that Glenn Beck is sane?	0
"God doesn't damn his children and bring condemnation on them. Its actually Satan that does that not God.  That's why I believe in reincarnation, (not that I wouldn't mind an eternal darkness, it just doesn't quite make sense to me) because I strongly believe some part of us does live on after death. I think that once we die, our souls pass through into the ""otherworld"" or an afterlife, to go through karmic debts paid, and new debt to go. The afterlife is like a paradise, a vacation if you will. And once you are ready to incarnate into your next life, all ""wrongdoings"" in your previous life will result in issues in your next life. Lessons that you need to learn from in order to grow spiritually Reincarnation is flawed because if someone is clinically dead and comes back they aren't a new person or animal they are back as the same person as they once were."

Terrorists do not deserve the same rights and benefits as our citizens. Many of them are combatants and should be tried as such.  While I do not believe in leniency towards terrorism, I do believe that a person requires a fair trial and humane punishment for their crimes.

Further, militant Islamists use our mistreatment of prisoners as recruiting material. If you don't believe me, read some of their newsletters.	I do believe you. They do use our treatment as propaganda. Our current policy makes us look tough. It also gets results. Civilized rules of engagement and law mean nothing to a vicious enemy willing to do anything to succeed. If we want to prevail, then we need a similar strategy: success at nearly any cost. If a nation refuses to bend, then that nation is doomed to break. In the war on terror we need to suspend the rule of law in part, in order to preserve it.	0

"I'm going to make a few points to settle this debate once and for all and prove that pirates are better than ninjas and I'm going to be realistic about this: FIRST OFF: Pirates and Piracy have been around ALOT longer than ninjas. Piracy originated in 13th Century B.C. in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas. Ninjas came about in 14th Century A.D Japan. SECOND: Pirates were incredibly brutal, vicious killers. They weren't frequently drunk as depicted in pop culture. In fact, pirates were rarely able to get their hands on beverages such as rum due to their life at sea. Raids and Pillages idn't come often. THIRD: A ninja's skills are greatly exaggerated. That fast as lightning stuff or whatever is absolute bullshit. They're not super human, they don't have ""powers"" that regular people do not. LASTLY: Pirates are real. Let me explain. We know pirates exist. They're active at this very moment. A ninja is an ideal. They're almost a myth in a kind of a way. You don't ever here of ninja attacks in the news. There are no secret ninjas cults that aren't made of geeks living in their mothers' basements. The point is: The Ninja is extinct and Piracy is alive and well, END OF STORY!"	If you are using modern day pirates as an example, then in all honesty i find it disgusting that you choose to support them. When people say they think pirates are cool, they are more than likely thinking of the pirates of days gone by. If instead you choose to stand behind modern day pirates, you are supporting drugs, kidnapping, human trafficking, terrorism, torture and murder.	0
Rorschach is a dangerous, murdering madman. Literally. And if you're not getting that vibe heavily enough from the horrible movie, try the comic.(It's better anyways.) Batman is also crazy, but uh, at least he has his limits.	Batman is just as much of a murderous madman, hanging people from planes, crushing them with statues and in junkyards, impaling them on swords, starving them to death and burning them to death whilst getting laid in front of their burning bodies amongst other killings. ://www.cracked.com/article20111the-6-most-brutal-murders-committed-by-batman.html  He also dragged a criminal through a plate glass window and gave him the choice to either bleed to death or tell him what he wanted to know and thats just the comics. In the 1989 movie he killed the Joker even stating his intention and in Batman returns fries one of the Penguins henchmen with the Batmobiles engine and shoves a bomb down a strongmans trousers before kicking him down a drain to explode, this last killing even makes him grin the man's psychotic.	0
"True, but no single human is ""pure logic"". Human's are creatures privy to emotions, weakness and double standards. Like you said, Belief doesn't alter logic. I agree with you there. How could I not? It's a fact. What I was saying was no single human can use logic without being influenced by their emotions in some way. This will corrupt their reasoning slightly, and will cause people to see what they want to see in most philosophical debates."	There is a BIG difference between logic and reasoning. Logic never changes under emotion, but the reasoning does. So for example, 2+2 cannot equal 5. That is the logic. But if you were so heavily influenced by emotions that you somehow reasoned that it does equal 5, the logic would not change. The reasoning would.	0
"If you wouldn't put a human to ""sleep"",then you certainly shouldn't put an animal to sleep!I mean,if a human would have murdered someone,you'd send them to jail.But if a dog would have bit someone,it just automatically gives them the right to put them to sleep?Well,it certainly should not!"	If a dog bites someone, what do you do? If it bites an adult, you should be able to punish it so it doesn't do it again, but if it maims a child, then what? If my animal did that to someone, I would be devastated, and I wouldn't want to put it down.  I suppose I would put up one of those electric shock collar fences and simply watch my dog carefully.  If it killed someone, perhaps it'd have to be put down though. This is a tough subject, but I think you need to look at each case by itself. If a dog is normally peaceful, perhaps it was only having a bad day. If a dog is always aggressive, always snarling, and finally it attacks, perhaps it should be put down.	0
Great Depression? Wow, you are drinking Obama's kool aid. Not really, it's an obvious fact to anyone not invested in corporate freedom. Since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. So if companies fail as did GM, they fail and not bail them out. I agree, let bad companies fail. Oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. I guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? Federal Government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's. One more sign that capitalism and the market aren't the magical cureall that you think.	I agree, let bad companies fail. Oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. I guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? So, when a small business fails, what does the government?  Oh, who gives fuck, you nobody? Nobody lets companies grow so big, they grow big due to demand and government helps them go bigger by regulations.	0
atheists are less aware people. They just blindly follow the hypothesis of infidels. Atheists are less realistic and less practical.  I have met many atheists. If i say anything against any religion they just accept it as universal truth without checking anything. If i say that there is no God. They would nod to say yes. without asking me that on which basis do i say that.  If some one says there is no hell nor there is any paradise. They would not ask me on which basis do i say that. They are actually blind believers.  But if any Muslim comes and gives some arguments about the reality and some rhetoric they would simply laugh and say that the Muslim is a full. Atheists are not even able to judge between just and unjust, true and untrue or simply right or wrong. They are just prejudiced.  Quran says that their hearts have been sealed and their eyes have been covered and their ears and not able to hear any more that is why they can not see the reality that exists.  So when they die they must realize that it is so dark. They would simply say that after death for them their is darkness of the highest degree.	Wow, seriously? I will respect your beliefs a bit more if you don't stone your children, or enslave your women as said in the scriptures.	0
Yes, just like you can loan out a dollar a thousand times, you can pay back a dollar a thousand times. I'm not sure what your disputing.  I fail to see how we can grow more, when the basic resources for growing is much more limited. Currently 1 dollar issued by the fed can not only be spent multiple times, but by the money multiplier effect could theoretically be spent multiple times at the same time, financing more projects. I also don't see how currency stability could overcome uncertainty in income such that people can plan that long without significant risk which normally stops people from doing such.	ok. I'll explain it in computer engineering language. .. I'm assuming that you know C/C++ and know about pointers. And forget for a moment that the problem scope is completely inappropriate. (programming is linear, economics is complex/network and adaptive) Money is a pointer, it represents all sorts of things. But it must be completely strict and sound. If pointers shifted locations on their own, or changed without notifying anything, it's a big pile of mess. Variables and data structures. And if you did embedded C programming, you'd know that we can use pointers to jump the program counter and cause all sorts of runtime hazards and the resources are REALLY* tight. But, while pointers can represent anything, even as a basket to transport things, we are not at liberty to make an infinite amount of pointers because of the limitations of the system. Of course, being engineers and using non sentient systems, we can exploit and abuse these things to our heart's content. But pointers have very strict rules. Pointers are not permitted to be mutable, and there are structural hazards in using pointers to point to pointers to point to pointers ad infinitum. As with currency, it is essentially debt that symbolizes debt, that symbolizes debt all the way until it hits gold somewhere. But in the modern world, this gold stopgap is removed completely. Therefore, the chain of symbols will go on forever all falling to their intrinsic value. At the same time, pointers cannot be mutable meaning, it's is not ok to have one pointer pointer to one thing, and then have 2 pointers or multiple pointers point to the same thing (many to one) nor can we have a many to many situation, even with the very best accounting. Even in NUMA architectures, memory must be assigned strictly to their instructions, otherwise we have a huge mess. The difference between the dollar and gold is that gold has intrinsically within it, these specific limitations that avoids these structural hazards. To substitute it for something else would introduce a whole other set of structural hazards which may or may not be conducive to a sound economic system. The problems of economic is more like trying to isolate harmonics in a circuit network, rather than doing a top down design approach. The complex adaptive system model applies to economics in the manner in which each agent (humans) learns in their own microcosm which moves the entire economics. If this didn't do any good, we're going to need a blackboard, a pint and lots of time.	0

If you attempt to point out what this 'life force' is you will see that all your attempts are fruitless. Life is litterally nothing but a hugely complicated chemical system. This view is directly entailed by the second law of thermodynamics, and it explains why there's no fundamental gap between life and non-life.  We can see that the term life only causes confusion: We could ask if bacteria are alive, and most would agree that they are. But are viruses alive? This question should be straight forward to answer, but for some reason biologists tend to disagree. They are more simple than bacteria, and those we agree are alive, but viruses seem more, well, non-living. Then there's viroids, which are smaller than viruses, and arguably more simple. Do they have 'life force' or are they just a set of complicated chemicals interacting with other complicated chemical systems? What about a free floating string of RNA which just so happens to interact with a human cell? Nobody would call such a string alive. There is no objective criteria which seperates life from non-life. The term 'life' causes nothing but confusion. Are bacteria alive? As far as an objective inquiry goes, they, just like viruses, are nothing than a set of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. They are just more complicated. Any in-depth analysis will show that bacteria are as non-living as free floating RNA, viruses or anything like it; it's nothing but thermodynamics. But if bacteria aren't alive then what exactly does it mean to be alive? I am linking you a rather interesting article which in part deals with this issue (it primarily shows how life is an inherent consequence of the second law of thermodynamics) If you read it, you might be convinced that any difference between 'life' and 'non-life' is an arbitrary, mental conception. 'Life' is 'life' because we have given it such a meaning, that's my take on it anyway. <a href='http://www.helsinki.fi/~aannila/arto/whylife.pdf'>http://www.helsinki.fi/~aannila/arto/whylife.pdf 	"Life is literally nothing but a hugely complicated chemical system. This view is directly entailed by the second law of thermodynamics, and it explains why there's no fundamental gap between life and non-life. Take out the word life and replace it with ""The Universe."" Which would be correct. You are only explaining the existence of things and how they exist. Those things you explain as non-living are well... non-living. They do still exist, but they are non-living. Yes, everything is a complex chemical system, but that is only explaining how everything and everybody exist. It's whether the chemical reactions are actually creating life or not. That's what matters. That's the difference between living and existing, because not everything that exist is a living organism. The difference between non-living things and living things is right there in the definition. Compare and contrast: Rocks; came into existence from chemicals reactions so they exist. Animals and people; came into existence through chemical reactions so they exist, but they are also alive Compare: they both exist Contrast: animals and people are alive, but rocks are not. Now you see a difference?"	0
No, sin created a degeneration in today's world. You're implying I said something I never said. I never implied Adam and Eve created Aids. Their sin allowed Aids to enter the world Adam and Eve created the Aids virus by sinning.  Jimbo didn't kill Bob, Jimbo's shank allowed Bob to die. This is essentially what you are arguing. Placing blame on the verb(shank/sin) rather than the noun(Adam/jimbo).    Moving on... How could a virus that did not exist before, come into existence out of thin air? Adam and Eve cannot create life out of thin air. Sin is not a 'thing' it is an action.	Adam and Eve created the Aids virus by sinning. Adam and Eve created NOTHING by sinning. They only pushed the world away from God. This caused God's perfect world to naturally start degenerating, as nature tends to do that. This degeneration created the Aids virus out of something else, just like you believe dogs came from something else. Creation doesn't deny Natural Selection, it denies Particles to People evolution. How could a virus that did not exist before, come into existence out of thin air? How could a cell that did not exist before cone into existence out of thin air? You would argue it didn't come out of 'thin air', it came from a prettied-up primordial soup. I'm not saying it came out of nowhere, I'm saying it was something else and changed into the Aids virus. Adam and Eve cannot create life out of thin air.  You're right. They couldn't and didn't. Sin is not a 'thing' it is an action. Sin is actually a state of being, not an action. It is used as a verb to categorize verbs that separate people from God. That separation is sin, and that causes degeneration.	0

Firstly abortion has to do with an unborn life, innocent of all crimes, mistakes or guilt. The fetus as we all know is referred to as a growing human being which can also be referred to as a human organism. The term organism refers to life so the terms combined would mean human life. The Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.  The death penalty refers to the punishment decreed by the constitution equivalent to the crime committed and is part of the law. What puzzles me is many who oppose the death penalty supports abortion when they claim that they are so concerned about human life. If they are so concerned about human life then why would they support the taking of the life of the unborn? This in my opinion is hypocrisy. Practice what you speak not the opposite.  Why fight for the life of a criminal who has and may continue to kill and never regret it when at the same time you are supporting for innocent young lives to be killed in horrific methods of abortion when you claim the death penalty is horrific itself.	Firstly abortion has to do with an unborn life, innocent of all crimes, mistakes or guilt. The fetus as we all know is referred to as a growing human being which can also be referred to as a human organism. The term organism refers to life so the terms combined would mean human life. The Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.  Most abortions occur before the embryo becomes a foetus, about 50%. Around 35% occur before it's a well-developed foetus. This means you're killing unconscious, unintelligent tissues. It isn't a human life at this point. A well-developed foetus isn't a human life either, because its body depends on another host being, its body is not complete in other words. What puzzles me is many who oppose the death penalty supports abortion when they claim that they are so concerned about human life. If they are so concerned about human life then why would they support the taking of the life of the unborn? This in my opinion is hypocrisy. Practice what you speak not the opposite.  This is simple actually. Killing a prisoner is removing a living, breathing, thinking human from existence. Killing a foetus is removing something that only resembles a human, but is not for lack of ability to think, from existence. Why fight for the life of a criminal who has and may continue to kill and never regret it when at the same time you are supporting for innocent young lives to be killed in horrific methods of abortion when you claim the death penalty is horrific itself. Because they are not innocent young lives. They are in the process of becoming lives.	0

Don't forget that to satanists not murdering children in the name of satan is a sin	The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1967   1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  3. When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  9. Do not harm little children.  10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.	0
If you believe in Global Warming then you are as egotistical as the people who believed that humans were at the center of the universe. You are a sun denier that thinks that humans have a greater effect on our weather than the sun. ;)	that thinks that humans have a greater effect on our weather than the sun. 1. We are talking about climate, not weather. 2. We do not need to have a greater affect than the sun to be able to increase temperatures globally.	0
That is really the main reason I hate math: There is only one answer that is correct! In english you can interpret stuff however you want and as long as you back up your interpretation with good arguments then you will still get full credit. There is just so much more room for error, whereas in math if you are off by .00001 you can get the answer wrong and all your hard work will be for naught! Plus I just took the hardest math test I have ever taken ever and it just totally kicked my ass! I'm pretty sure I failed!	If English means anything, then it really means nothing. The whole point of a language is to convey ideas. If you can interpret someone's words any way you want, then it's safe to say their original idea was not conveyed at all and the whole point of their paper/speech/artwork was lost.	0

Yes atheism is a religion because even though its a belief system in no gods they still have a belief in a god. Their belief system is contradictory. Atheists believe in evolution (which is a theory) which is their god. They have faith it exists and they have faith that the universe began with the big bang. That is their god wether they realize it or not.	"Atheism literally means lack of religion. Evolution is not a god, it is a natural occurrence happening as I write this very argument, and has been around since the moment this universe came to existence with its current laws. Saying atheism is religion is the same as saying being gay is being religious, that being feverish is being religious, that being sleepy is being religious. Atheism is a state of not adhering to any religion. The only definitions of ""believe"" that apply to atheists are, or should be (copy-paste from another debate): 1) to think, assume, or suppose 2) to think that someone is able to do (a particular action) 3) to have a conviction that (a person or thing) is, has been, or will be engaged in a given action or involved in a given situation There is no taking something as absolute truth without evidence supporting it and if they do take something as such then the moment proof to the contrary is provided they will change their opinions (the definition of assuming and supposing and thinking something). So, if you come here claiming this and that you better know what you are talking about. That is their god wether they realize it or not. You are so wrong whether you realize it or not."	0
Your soul is sick. Considering that those stats are accurate, consider the following: 1. If America had never intervened, how many more would Osama have killed? 2.

Yes, electronic cigarettes should be brought on. Ii has no damage on human, it does not have nicotine. It will help to people who is addicted to cigarette to stop.	"Electronic cigarettes are still fairly new and there hasn't been a lot of studies on the long term effects of smoking it, so saying that "" it has no damage on humens"" is untrue because we simply do not know. And its not just the smoker you have to worry about, its also the effects of the second hand smoke that also is very under studied."	0
Gun control is a good thing, let me just shred all of the gun nuts' arguments: 1) If there is a prohibition on guns / certain kinds of guns only the law abiding will get rid of their guns and the criminals will 'out gun them': a) The presence of lots of guns in a country means everyone has greater access to them, both law abiding and non law abiding, it will take a long time to reduce the amount of guns in circulation in the US to European levels. There would be a period of transition where criminals would be better armed than the law abiding, but long term America would be a much safer place. The US already has gun registration laws, this means that unlicensed guns are constantly being taken out of circulation and criminals need to replenish their stocks. Make that harder for them! You should be aware that the Mexican cartels import their guns from the US, drugs go north, guns go south. If guns were outlawed, where would the criminals get them from? Canada? b) The presence of guns creates criminals! OK if I come home one day and find the poolboy nuts deep in my wife, if I had a gun to hand I'd probably be inclined to shoot them both. If I have to go at them with the bread knife the pool boy has a very good chance of getting away and a murder not being committed.  As evidence see: Switzerland. Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime, but very high levels of gun murder - why? Because Switzerland operates 'universal conscription' meaning every adult male has to do military service and be ready to defend his country at a moments notice (I guess in case the Germans want their gold back...). This means that they all have guns in the home. They don't have a lot of criminals, but still have disproportionately high levels of gun crime, and a lot of dead pool boys. 2) Owning guns is a check on the tyranny, we have the right to defend ourselves against our own government. The US government has over one million (500K regulars) of the best trained, best equipped soldiers in the world, you are a yahoo in a pickup. The US government has the M1A2 Abrams, you have an Armalite AR15. Good luck with that.  And remember, your soldiers are citizens too, what happened in Egypt when Hozni tried to turn the army on the protesters? The army joined them making more protesters. With tanks. Isn't it amazing that those Republican eeijts that are against gun control are also in favour of increasing defense spending? 3) It's in the constitution No it isn't, it's in the second amendment to the constitution. Do you know what the word 'amendment' means?  The constitution is a very fine and visionary document, drafted by some of the finest thinkers of their age... the 18th century. It is not set in stone and over the years the US government has taken a pragmatic approach to changing bits that are no longer relevant, no paper money etc. - currently up to 27 amendments. Nor, even within the 2nd amendment does it state you can bear any arms you like, at the time they'd have meant muskets and rudimentary rifles... personally I don't feel I'll be safe until I have a stash of weaponized anthrax, surely that falls under the second amendment? And finally... Although I live in a country with bizarre notions about not owning guns of any description, if I did live in Texas, I would totally have a gun collection. Guns are cool. But that does not make them a good idea!	Prohibition didn't work for alcohol, it isn't working for drugs and guess what genius it won't work for guns. If you had half a brain you would already know that.	0
I have two ps3's which I like and I never will buy an xbox360. Preference really comes down to what your mates have, and the few exclusive titles. To me a Ps3 represented better value, with inbuilt hard drive, and an array of media settings with bluray and wifi. Plus everything looks awesome on my full hd tv. If all you want to do is play online, then by all means I would suggest Xbox360 for its Xbox Live interface. But if you jump on only a couple of times a week, ps3 is probably the wiser option, as you don't have to pay for most of the online content.  It all comes down to, what you want to use it for.	PS3 is GAY and U R GAY for liking it. Gayboy. GAY.....boooooooooooored.......im so booooooored.....	0
well really the corporations are exploiting male hormones, but 11 is young, I think people should avoid porn as much as possible, sex is something intimate and private, not something to be used to marvel. the processing of making porn itself is not very moral. I dislike porn because it leads to many things. If it helps you with a problem then whatever. Saying it's just instinct is a silly excuse(only in certain conditions) I can understand why you think it's not so bad. But come on, why encourage it. There are other things rather than pornography that stimulate you.	11 is young Too young for what? I started masturbating in elementary school. I didn't even know what I was doing. But it's proof that sexual urges start young. No exploiting at all. And I think it's wrong to push down and hide what it is kids are so curious about.  It makes them want to lie to their parents more, it makes them think that sex is something that is wrong, and it makes them more self-conscious about something that's natural. And pornography has been around for ages, it's been more public in different times than it is now, and those times flourished.  I seriously think it's wrong to hide such things because the negative effects it has, what harm does it do to be introduced to sex, and pornography, at a young age?	0

There are numerous examples of fairness in the real world. Just the other day I was out with some friends and one of them dropped his wallet without realizing it. Some stranger came running up and returned it to him. If people never behaved honorably there would be no civilization.	sure, you may get some honesty. But in order to apply fairness, everything must work out.	0
Everything should be questioned and believing something on faith is just silly (that is my opinion, question it if you like). If someone believes something on faith and not on proof/evidence then it just shows that they do not care whether or not it is true. Questioning things and looking at the evidence is what drives advances, that is why science advances and religion does not.	"Oh Doherty95, how many times must I tell you.  People don't rely on only faith to believe in something they cannot see. They rely on accounts, on personal experience, on ethos, on the very fact that truth cannot progress without wanting to know more than what's being spoon fed, people whom believe also rely on what they see every day, life; beauty; the universe. The existence of something can, and does, be used as a reason to have faith.  You're the one stuck in a primitive mindset believing ""There is no evidence"". There is evidence, for many people. And you can't see it, that's fine, there's no personal feelings. However, stop with the bullshit mindset that ""because I (you) do not believe, no one else can."" You're being unfair, like you own this place called THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Get off your high horse."	0
How can u say that we don't need religion for moral values ? actually 3 year old children can not decide what is right or wrong. you give hamster example but children feels it is bad because they are watching death , they fear death. in fact all animals (including humans) fear death by birth.	Yes, fearing death is natural. Religion didn't bring that did it? No. Humans have always feared death, even before your imbecile religion.	0

In my opinion surrogate mothering should be banned due to the fact that there are a lot of orphanage children. So the couple can adopted young child. Second reason- it's a big risk as in most cases surrogate mothers they get used to the child and they don't want to give to the couple	well, there are different ways of surrogacy, for example somehow medically the child can be connected at least to one parent, and that completely differs if they take an orphan or have their child in whom there is their blood	0
For example, conception is ordinarily considered the beginning of a person, however I think it's reasonable to believe that a persons development began before that That's a completely unfounded statement. It is ordinarily considered that when a number of organs stop functioning, that a person ceases to be, but I think it's reasonable to believe that the person has only changed significantly, and changing significantly from one stage of development to the next is what people do. Well with that logic you can say that when someone dies and becomes dust then the dust is a person. Things can change to such a degree that it isn't what it was original and that is an example. Another would be if I eat a beef burger and then shit out 4 hours later - believe me when I say it is not a tasty burger anymore in the same way that some dust that used to be a human 3000 years ago is not a person anymore. So you think it's IMPOSSIBLE for people to develop beyond the confines of their current biology? What you quoted as me pointing out that you mean figuratively extending not literally. 'Current biology'? Well yeah of course. Its called growing.	That's a completely unfounded statement. Are you sure you just aren't aware of my reasoning? Well with that logic you can say that when someone dies and becomes dust then the dust is a person. Or I could say that this dust is not all that became of the person. I know a number of people who are considered dead who are more inspiring than most who are considered alive. Things can change to such a degree that it isn't what it was original and that is an example. Perhaps from moment to moment such changes occur and it's only through our failure to ascribe significance to these changes that we don't see a need to create a new label for each stage of everything that changes. Another would be if I eat a beef burger and then shit out 4 hours later - believe me when I say it is not a tasty burger anymore It's a chewed up, partially digested, shat out burger,that would be tasty to flies, and some dogs.  in the same way that some dust that used to be a human 3000 years ago is not a person anymore. Every bit of the person remains albeit in changing form, just like your stinky burger shit. 'Current biology'? Well yeah of course. Its called growing. Extra credit points if you correctly guess which usage definition of literal I was thinking of when I chose that word :)	0
"""The fetus is, by all scientific standards, a living human being."" Not everybody believes this. There are even a few people out there that don't consider a baby ""alive"" until birth! I think life starts at conception (human life), but the liberal argument is that there comes a point where the ""clump of cells"" becomes a human. I think the most common time frame for this might be 8 weeks because it's the first heartbeat and brain activity. ""Our justice system is wrought with error."" It's not perfect, but conservatives have enough trust in it to put to death a man for slaughtering his entire family. Of course, not too many people want to use the death penalty for minor offenses. Some of the only cases that warrant capital punishment are those that involve cruel and viscous first degree murder."	"It doesn't matter what ""everybody believes"" or not. It's science: it doesn't ask your opinion, it simply is. And scientifically speaking, as far as we can currently tell, the life of a homo sapien begins at conception. A stereotypical conservative's perhaps misplaced trust in our judicial system does not justify the death of even a single innocent man. And on the ""cruel and viscous"" note, at what point does one murderer become crueler and more vicious than another, and how might one go about drawing that distinction in a non-arbitrary, non-reactionary way?"	0
I know all about the laws in these states constitutions. For the most part these laws are not enforced, except in cases where the person running for office publicly declares they are atheist. (Don't ask, don't tell.) Do this and the world would be a better place. As I stated, no true Christian would go after another human being. There will always be some radical group trying to cause trouble, just a fact of life. Mark Twain said, If some one goes after your name, ride out the storm. Don't feed it with a response. (paraphrased)	What the hell are you talking about? Atheists are constantly called evil and immoral by other Christians and are told they are going to hell, this is a country where we are at this point debating on the separation of church and state!	0
"Bakhytgul, you said that, ""Most people from Iran and Irak suffered more distress and you can not imanige that situation.

Obama, and if he was bad president, how he won the president's election?"	Obama is not a warmonger, he has talked down war, reduced military spending, agreed a nuclear disarmourment with russia for up to 40% of nuclear weapons over the next decade....he gave up the europe wide missile defence system as hes not an imperialist either....he wants to rebuild america at home. the man is at heart a pacifist who is trying to find the peaceful solutions in a war torn world.....hes improved relations with all americas allies and perhaps some of their enemies too...he has increased the respect and dare I say it., love people have for america overseas. he talks sense, common sense, hes practical , but he has high ideals too. he is courteous and polite but he will fight evil when necessary. so he is a strong leader but not an aggressive bullying one. He has not spoken with inflammatory language like bush, instead he has tried to reach out and find compromises, but when hes had to act he has acted. hes been infinitely more effective in foreign policy than bush o blair or many other leaders. his healthcare bill will in 10 years time, be seen as the greatest bill passed in american history. it will save 100s of millions of american lives in the next century and it may save you your friends and families and your children and their childrens children. he did all this in the middle of 2 unwinnable wars, biggest recession for 80 years, terrorism rife, banking and property collapse, 24 hour news creating hate and wars, global warming, scarce resources, rising poppulation, millions of illegal immigration, the rise of china , corporate corruption, 300 million guns in society etc etc	0
Ok so here are the thoughts that ran through my head as I read this.  1)Why would God prevent evil if evil is how we learn? 2)God is not willing but not malevolent because evil is a nessisary part of life. 3)He isn't willing,see statement #2.  4)He is able but not willing,once again, see statement #2. We have to remember we cannot put God in a box, he does not think like we do, his thoughts are not our thoughts. We do not have all the information of the world and the hearts of every man on earth like he does. We do not comprehend everthing he understands, that is why he is God.Evil is part of our lives,without it we would not know good. Without evil we couldn't know what good is because it would not be there. It is similar to the phrase, without trial,heartache and unhappiness there would not be happiness. We would never learn and grow if everything in this world was good. Think about the Revelutionary War, without that the United States of America would never have been created. Our forefathers would never have steeped themselves so fully in the study of what freedom is and we would be under the rule of Great Britan. Without evil or bad there is no good. God would never take that knowledge that he gave to Adam and Eve away from us.	"Okay so you are saying evil is necessary for us to learn and grow, and that is all fine and good in moderation, I will give you that, evil is necessary for us to distinguish good. But what do you have to say to little Timmy who got cancer and will die at 5 years of age, or 4 year old Juan who was killed in an earthquake. What did they learn from their experience, how did they grow? No other person did this to them, it just happened, and why them? you could say bad luck or coincidence but you religious folk aren't too fond of coincidences now are you. So why would an all powerful and loving god allow this 5 year old, innocent child to die? And these circumstances are by no means isolated incidents, this type of tragic death happens on a daily basis around the world. Now it seems like you are just making excuses for this god of yours. It sounds like a battered wife trying to defend her abusive husband. ""Oh he didn't mean to hit me offica, it was ma fault, I just din't have dinner on the table at 6:30 like he likes it, he's warned me several times offica."" Either own up and admit your husband is a dick or the much more realistic situation, your husband doesn't exist and terrible things happen in the world because ""evil"" as we perceive it to be, is natural in the world.  And please stop with the ""oh well god is out of our understanding and knows and created everything so his reasoning is exempt from our scorn"" crap. If i made the claim to you that I was my own father, and you pointed out that it was biologically and physically impossible for that to happen, I could just say that ""us self fathering people are outside of physics and genetics as YOU understand it, but we live by a different set of rules."" I would mocked into obscurity and i would deserve it, you cannot exclude god from these arguments simply by retreating to the substance less backup of a lack of ""well he is god so he MUST have logic we cannot comprehend."""	0

A gravity well does not merely move particles towards the center of gravity, those particles have their own gravity well which draws other particles inward towards them, and repeat this to infinity Okay. Yes, I can see that things like that would happen. But say you have an abnormally-shaped gas cloud in space. (I'm assuming most clouds aren't spherical.) The particles on the edges would be pulled strongly toward the center, while the particles in the middle would be pulled weakly toward the center, while the particles in the center would be pulled nowhere. This is based on the location of every other particle to the individual particle in question. No, as the cloud collapses, say, unevenly, some particles would slow down because there are now particles 'behind' them because the one went too quickly. Some would speed up as those 'behind' it (behind is away from the center of mass of the cloud) moved to the front. As this goes on, the cloud should collapse until the particles are like a liquid. If I understand your question, hydrogen gas and helium are light elements and would be drawn together. The mass of iron, nickle, and other heavy elements would draw their own matter towards them. These heavier elements are much less common, like you said drops in a bucket. They wouldn't form as big a mass as the sun, but be drawn towards it. I imagine that at some point they formed orbits. Hydrogen and helium are the lightest elements (that's why a helium balloon floats [where as hydrogen balloons explode--see the Hindenburg]). They would be forced away from wherever the center of mass is, because all the heavier things (iron, nickel, oxygen, methane, carbon, gold, lead, etc.) would be moving to the center. It's like this: If you put a helium balloon on a bus and the bus suddenly accelerates quickly, the balloon would actually move forward. The heavier air is pushed to the back by inertia, pushing the balloon forward. The heavier elements are much, much fewer, yes, but that would mean what little there were should be dropped to the center much faster than hydrogen and helium. By the time the sun ignited, the heavier elements should all, or nearly all, be in the sun, not orbiting it. orbital mechanics is where I find myself really leaving my expertise comfort zone. Orbital mechanics is interesting. I enjoy it, but then again, I enjoy calculus as well. I have to imagine that the sheer mass of hydrogen and helium would form a body with enough gravity to draw in those particles even slowly. I'm a little out of my element in imagining the formation of orbits however, because this isn't my specialty. I'm not exactly sure myself. It gets tricky with a changing orbital mass. Yes, but these elements are lighter than iron, nickle, silicon, etc. Yes, they are, so I guess that part would be true. That's right, but we have also gained increasing complexity in the number of words, and dialects within a body of language. Number of words are a valid argument, but dialects ... I'm not sure. Most dialects tend to be less complex than their parent (Ebonics from American English, American from British, British from Saxon, etc.)	But say you have an abnormally-shaped gas cloud in space. (I'm assuming most clouds aren't spherical.) The particles on the edges would be pulled strongly toward the center, while the particles in the middle would be pulled weakly toward the center, while the particles in the center would be pulled nowhere. This is based on the location of every other particle to the individual particle in question. I perceive it as the outer particles being pulled towards the not-so outer particles, which are pulled towards the even closer particles, up until the inner part of the cloud (assuming that is where the most mass lies) otherwise you could have separate gravitational collection points within the cloud if everything is distributed heterogeneously. No, as the cloud collapses, say, unevenly, some particles would slow down because there are now particles 'behind' them because the one went too quickly. Some would speed up as those 'behind' it (behind is away from the center of mass of the cloud) moved to the front. As this goes on, the cloud should collapse until the particles are like a liquid. If we assume that there is a central mass to the cloud, yes. Unless of course the cloud has multiple large mass points which pull matter from nearby clouds towards them. I believe this is the process of planetary accretion. I looked further into it, and should add a condition: small clouds are not affected enough by gravity to accrete. They will rely on brownian motion instead. However cosmic quantities of gas should have enough gravitational pull to work as suggested. It wouldn't make sense if they did not, given the mass. Hydrogen and helium are the lightest elements (that's why a helium balloon floats [where as hydrogen balloons explode--see the Hindenburg]). They would be forced away from wherever the center of mass is, because all the heavier things (iron, nickel, oxygen, methane, carbon, gold, lead, etc.) would be moving to the center. It's like this: If you put a helium balloon on a bus and the bus suddenly accelerates quickly, the balloon would actually move forward. The heavier air is pushed to the back by inertia, pushing the balloon forward. The heavier elements are much, much fewer, yes, but that would mean what little there were should be dropped to the center much faster than hydrogen and helium. By the time the sun ignited, the heavier elements should all, or nearly all, be in the sun, not orbiting it. I discovered some considerations I failed to make. Apparently the early formation of our solar system was in the vicinity of thousands of young stars and exploding supernovas. This would trigger the birth of our sun before all mass would be pulled towards the center, and it would expel heavier elements towards it. Orbits would be affected by the sun's angular momentum, apparently. Also, the temperature of a newly born sun would prevent elements with low boiling points from condensing into the planetesimals. Number of words are a valid argument, but dialects ... I'm not sure. Most dialects tend to be less complex than their parent (Ebonics from American English, American from British, British from Saxon, etc.) Consider the diverging nature of language, and how a small population of English speakers from England diverged into an entire continent of different dialects. There isn't just one dialect in America but dozens, some are unintelligible to the uninitiated.	0

Proving, king Louis reign was flawed. Once the king or Prince dies, so does the legend. With a dictator the person in charge decided what everything stands for and if he's killed, anyone can pick up his legend making it the new dictatorship under the same rule. Funny story, a lot of modern nazi's believe they will find a <a href='http://www.ewtn.com/library/NEWAGE/HITLEROC.TXT'>reincarnated hitler to pick up where he left off.	Nazis think they will find another Hitler? I don't even think Germany would allow it. Well his reign wasn't really flawed. The next ones in line screwed it up and didn't run the place like her did because their system was very powerful.	0
So, in your view, how did the universe begin? Presently nobody knows, including the religious. The best that science can tell us is that our universe is either cyclical, or the result of a quantum fluctuation. These are really just very educated extrapolations of theory at this point however. After that, something we do know about in great detail happened, the Big Bang, which formed our universe. Protostars formed from hydrogen and gravity, then nebula formed, which made new stars and galaxies, and accreted into planets. We are standing upon one such planet. Same question as above, but with genetic code. Abiogenesis, which formed many simpler molecules first, until complexity progressed into self-replicating molecules, which grew into hybrids of nucleic acid and enzymes which could reach themselves (ribozymes). Then we would have something like DNA in protocells. Endosymbiont theory deals with the formation of eukaryotic cells. If we created language, and random chance is making more information in the world, than why are languages getting more simple? They aren't actually. New words are formed every day, and languages diverge constantly into new dialects. Look at Ebonics and Singlish as examples. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish'>Singlish example: Dis guy Singrish si beh powerful sia. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English'>Ebonics Given decades, and especially centuries, languages naturally evolve and diverge from each other. Try reading this: Harold Godƿinson, oþþe Harold II (c. 1022 - 14 Ƿinterfylleþ, 1066) ƿæs se endenīehsta Seaxisca cyning Englalande. Hē ƿēold fram 5um Æfterran Ȝēolan tō 14um Ƿinterfylleðes, 1066, þonne hē ƿearþ in þǣm Beadƿe Hǣstingum ȝecƿeald. Haroldes fæder ƿæs Godƿin, se onƿealdiȝa Eorl Ƿestseaxes.

This is Anglo-Saxon, colloquial known as Old English. Our modern tongue has so diverged over a period of one millennium that we cannot natively understand it.	"After that, something we do know about in great detail happened, the Big Bang, which formed our universe. Protostars formed from hydrogen and gravity, then nebula formed, which made new stars and galaxies, and accreted into planets. We are standing upon one such planet. So the universe came about out of nothing (we don't know how, but it did), and the Big Bang created matter out of nothing. That sounds like Creationism to me. As for stars, is there enough gravity in a nearly-uniform hydrogen cloud to form stars? If so, why don't interstellar gas clouds clump into fairly small objects instead of being spread-out. And if nebula formed solar systems, than why is the majority of the hydrogen and helium (the lightest elements) in the center. If gravity was the main factor, wouldn't the heavy elements go to the center and the lighter ones be the ones to form planets? Instead, it seems the opposite has happened--heavy elements stayed out to form planets, while the lighter ones formed the Sun and Saturn. Abiogenesis, which formed many simpler molecules first, until complexity progressed into self-replicating molecules, which grew into hybrids of nucleic acid and enzymes which could reach themselves (ribozymes). Then we would have something like DNA in protocells. Endosymbiont theory deals with the formation of eukaryotic cells. So, basically, non-living matter formed life? Once again, that seems like Creationism. Look at Ebonics and Singlish as examples. Ebonics seems like slang--a simplified version of English. Singlish is a mixture of languages, and I assume they didn't choose the most complex parts of each language to be in there. languages naturally evolve and diverge from each other. I don't argue with this. I know languages change. But they tend to get more simple. Latin and it's offspring have full conjugation, whereas the much younger English doesn't. ""I go, you go, he goes, we go, y'all go, and they go."" The verb 'go' has been conjugated, but they're all the same. In older languages, the verbs differ."	0

 However, you could disagree in a non-condescending manner. What have I said that is condescending? I can't tell you why God does some of the things He does, which goes back to me saying previously that we don't understand His ways.  From what I can tell, and this is not personal, that just seems to be a typical response when God's authority and nature is challenged. God does something good: he is loving, kind, omnibenevolent, etc. God does something bad: he works in mysterious ways, we can't know his true nature, etc. Just how I see it. He gave us all free-will, the choice to believe or not believe. Sadomasochism can be consensual. We don't love him because we fear him. We love him because we love him. We respect him because we fear him. Fear is a natural response from any creation in regards to their creator. OK. But is fear the natural response? How are we supposed to know that?	"I apologize if I've gotten riled. I mistook your earlier post for condescension. I'm sorry. ""God does something good: he is loving, kind, omnibenevolent, etc. God does something bad: he works in mysterious ways, we can't know his true nature, etc."" That's not what I meant. He works in mysterious ways all the time. Sometimes He puts us through trials to allow us to acknowledge our true strength, other times He blesses us. He isn't the cause of evil, He is the exonerator of it.  ""Sadomasochism can be consensual."" Yes, it can, but Christianity is not sadomasochism. Sadomasochism is generally defined as receiving acts of pain and/or humiliation for pleasure. God Himself does not inflict pain and/or humiliation on anyone. We do that to ourselves, or with Lucifer's help. God absolves us from pain. ""But is fear the natural response? How are we supposed to know that?"" I guess it's safe to say we can't know that for absolute sure. But it only makes sense. If I were face-to-face with my ultimate creator, I would expect myself to be somewhat fearful, not because God is malevolent, but because according to my beliefs, He created ALL things. When He wields that much power, but chooses to be kind and merciful rather than abusive, that, to me, is worth fear and respect."	0

Immigrants don't have a very big impact in Australian culture. And they don't encourage racism. When immigrants first come hey do bring certain customs and food, but after a generation that will change. The new generation will live like an Australian. And sport in Australia would not be a careless matter. Aussies love sport and they won't let it go!	"I think immigrants make a huge impact. Want an example? watch 'Masterchef"" and you will see the contestants making pasta one night, and a stir-fry the next. Go to the city and you will see italian, chinese, indian and mexican restaurants on the same street. This does not change after a generation. European migrants have already been in Australia for a generation already, and foods like pasta, curries, noodles and hot-dogs are eaten by many people, not just those who eat it as part of their culture. I'm using food as an example, but migrants changed Australia a lot. Migrants even shaped Australia into the way it is today. Remember that, with the exception of Aborigines, all families in Australia were migrants at one point. Don't bother trying to tell me that the Aborigines played cricket. People in Australia even celebrate some cultural festivities and celebrations, even if they have absolutely nothing to do with the culture in question. I have seen people of many races celebrate the Chinese new year, as well as plenty of buskers with kilt, bagpipes and all, who aren't Scottish. Add to that Irish dancers who aren't Irish, Asian and Indian Christians, I think you get the idea... I may have been biased in my comments about sport in my main argument, but there have been Australian customs are have been diminished as new waves of migrants come in, like being patriotic and love of meat pies."	0

So you've been taken care of by a more intelligent species all your life. One of them leads you away from where you are kept, which is not unusual. Why would you be suspicious? Why would you be suspiciouswhen they take out an unknown object and point it at you? I mean, a horse's idea of a predator leaps at you with fangs and claws, right? This does not mean that the horse is any less sentient than we are. They weren't 'put' on the planet, they strived to survive like us.	"""They strived to survive, like us""...  Exactly.  We can go all night to determine if animals were put here on earth for us, or if humans were ""put"" here to be the top species, the be the top of the food chain.  As you say, we're all (animals included) are in this universe to survive, to thrive, that's a purpose. And so, for a human to kill another animal for food, shelter and comfort is hardly cruel. It's natural.  Human to human is a completely different ball game.  It's obviously blurred to you, however to me it's not blurred. A human killing another human is wrong. A human killing another animal is fine. An animal killing another animal is fine. Do you see this?"	0
Islamist many time stated that they want to kill all non-Muslims that means that want to kill more than 5 000 000 000 people, they just aren't capable to so.

No religion describes God(s) the way you do. The dictionary gets it's definition based on what we know about God(s) from current religious texts.

This is my opinion obviously (and I didn't always feel so strongly about it) but I think that child rapist and abusers deserve to die. I heard a story the other day (on the news) about a young stepfather who was arrested for beating and sodomizing his two year old stepson, I heard another story a while ago of a mother who put her infant in a microwave and nuked it till it died. How can anyone think that people like that can or should be allowed to live in society again?	People like that are generally raised wrong. What they do can't be fixed.

Killing someone for a crime is hypocritical, you killed someone so we will kill you.

They chose to die in order to murder. It is then merely a matter of following through on their choice; they killed themselves.	0
Gun control is a good thing, let me just shred all of the gun nuts' arguments: 1) If there is a prohibition on guns / certain kinds of guns only the law abiding will get rid of their guns and the criminals will 'out gun them': a) The presence of lots of guns in a country means everyone has greater access to them, both law abiding and non law abiding, it will take a long time to reduce the amount of guns in circulation in the US to European levels. There would be a period of transition where criminals would be better armed than the law abiding, but long term America would be a much safer place. The US already has gun registration laws, this means that unlicensed guns are constantly being taken out of circulation and criminals need to replenish their stocks. Make that harder for them! You should be aware that the Mexican cartels import their guns from the US, drugs go north, guns go south. If guns were outlawed, where would the criminals get them from? Canada? b) The presence of guns creates criminals! OK if I come home one day and find the poolboy nuts deep in my wife, if I had a gun to hand I'd probably be inclined to shoot them both. If I have to go at them with the bread knife the pool boy has a very good chance of getting away and a murder not being committed.  As evidence see: Switzerland. Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime, but very high levels of gun murder - why? Because Switzerland operates 'universal conscription' meaning every adult male has to do military service and be ready to defend his country at a moments notice (I guess in case the Germans want their gold back...). This means that they all have guns in the home. They don't have a lot of criminals, but still have disproportionately high levels of gun crime, and a lot of dead pool boys. 2) Owning guns is a check on the tyranny, we have the right to defend ourselves against our own government. The US government has over one million (500K regulars) of the best trained, best equipped soldiers in the world, you are a yahoo in a pickup. The US government has the M1A2 Abrams, you have an Armalite AR15. Good luck with that.  And remember, your soldiers are citizens too, what happened in Egypt when Hozni tried to turn the army on the protesters? The army joined them making more protesters. With tanks. Isn't it amazing that those Republican eeijts that are against gun control are also in favour of increasing defense spending? 3) It's in the constitution No it isn't, it's in the second amendment to the constitution. Do you know what the word 'amendment' means?  The constitution is a very fine and visionary document, drafted by some of the finest thinkers of their age... the 18th century. It is not set in stone and over the years the US government has taken a pragmatic approach to changing bits that are no longer relevant, no paper money etc. - currently up to 27 amendments. Nor, even within the 2nd amendment does it state you can bear any arms you like, at the time they'd have meant muskets and rudimentary rifles... personally I don't feel I'll be safe until I have a stash of weaponized anthrax, surely that falls under the second amendment? And finally... Although I live in a country with bizarre notions about not owning guns of any description, if I did live in Texas, I would totally have a gun collection. Guns are cool. But that does not make them a good idea!	1) a) There is no valid evidence of this. Sorry, countries that have banned guns aren't safer. b)Switzerland is an incredibly law abiding place, very, very low levels of crime Why do you ignore that they have low levels of crime? People die every day, the cause doesn't matter, or at least in this situation you haven't shown it matters. 2) We shouldn't be allowed to defend ourselves from the government because they are so advanced we don't stand a chance? Really? That's your argument? We don't need guns because the government WILL wipe us out. Great job. 3) Do you know what the word amendment means? An amendment is still part of the thing it amends. If we give up our guns will you give up your 1st amendment rights and STFU?	0

"""Any absolutist attitude is always a religious attitude, and in whatever respect a man becomes absolute, there you see his religion."" Carl Jung. All that is is someone else's opinion, that's all, and it's wrong. If evidence says religion is false then that is exactly as it is, and yes, it is absolute, because it is backed up by abundant proof. Denying that proof is very stupid. If someone claims that Earth is round with absolute certainty then that is that person's religion? If someone saw a cat piss all over a pillow and that person says it happened with absolute certainty, then that is the person's religion? You see the stupidity? Religion means that someone or something has created all of this and is controlling all of this. Or claims anything nonexistent to be real and to be followed."	Is evidence a constant or does it change? Based on the fact that evidence doesn't change, one can concluded that any conclusion based on it is merely an opinion. What makes your opinion superior? Wishing to be god, doesn't make you one. I use logic and critical thinking, What do you use? Definition of RELIGION 1a: the state of a religious b (1): the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2): commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance  2: a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices  3 archaic: scrupulous conformity : conscientiousness  4: a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith  These are the definitions of religion and not your opinion which is wrong so often.	0
"""Currency should be a gradual creation through market cooperation; not a standardization based on flawed principals that only become harder to fix over time."" I'm stating that gold and silver IS* a currency that was gradually created through market cooperation.  What you want, we already have, it already exists in the here and now and it's called gold and silver; market tested and apporved. I'm saying your position is in support of the gold standard and I was trying to explain why it is.

Each one that has been tried failed one of the 7 criteria for money as I listed above."	"While gold and silver grew through market cooperation, making it a ""standard"" is the issue.

Humans have never yet succeed in making life - a life with consciousness.  (I don't know if they have succeed in making plant life and stuff - do you know? I mean, you can buy seeds in a grocery store - but is it man-made or natural?) But whatever - as I said, life is the one thing scientists have yet to accomplish. Even though there is a possibility that life CAN be made (I doubt this though), I believe that creating life is something really powerful. I mean, I think its interesting to learn about the human body, how it is made - how the universe is made and all the different elementals combining, and making new substances. But what amazes me the most is life itself. The fact that I am present (This is really hard for me to explain :p) That I am aware of everything going around me .. I just think its remarkable. And to think that God made life - I think that is just as crazy, as believing big bang created life.	Yeah, I share your wonder at the fact that somehow, particles that originated in the core of a star billions of years ago have been assembled into a form that can know itself. I think that the fact this happened through purely natural processes is just amazing, after all, it'd be more impressive if a smiley face accidentally got burned into my toast then if I used one of those machines that does it automatically.  Also, if you think that life on Earth necessitates a designer, or at least, a beginner, then surely God would need one too, since he is infinitely more complex than us. Oh, and, no one thinks that the big bang created life. The big bang was the expansion of the universe where physics as we know it begins. Abiogenesis was the start of life on Earth. And no, I think it's less crazy to believe it happened naturally as, as I said, if complex life requires an intelligent being to create it, then surely that being must also require a designer. And if you say he is infinite or whatever, that's what I think the universe probably is.	0
Your list sounds strangely like it is persecution to tell people they are wrong. Why has Christianity been persecuting people so long? Why is Christianity based on persecution (witnessing)? I am not saying its wrong because the Bible mentions that Christians are going to be persecuted because of Christ. Christians haven't been persecuting other people at all but other people think we do because we are telling them what our beliefs state about certain things but that isn't wrong to do that.  You are not actually being persecuted in America, sorry, seeing as the video is an example of true persecution. China yes, America no. Its slowly coming to America and it will happen one of theses days and yes Christians do get persecuted in America but its not as big as the other countries.	I am not saying its wrong because the Bible mentions that Christians are going to be persecuted because of Christ.

Uh, please do explain how telling a Christian that evolution is truth is persecution, and telling an Atheist they are going to hell is not. Its slowly coming to America and it will happen one of theses days and yes Christians do get persecuted in America but its not as big as the other countries. Um, wrong. Here is all the links that I found where churches were toppled in America because they were Christian churches: Here is the link to all the underground Christian churches because the members can't go out in public: Oh, interesting, no links = no persecution.	0
Even though phobias are essentially mental, it does not change the fact that they exist. Making it a plausible excuse. That and who doesn't like a name like Didaskaleinophobia?	Though phobias exist, it is quite difficult to assess whether they are real fears or if the phobic is acting. I could easily convince anybody that I had a phobia (I've experience with arachnophobia), but that doesn't mean that I actually have it. Even if it is deemed a valid excuse, what if I said I had a fear of going to work. Would I get some sort of disability payment? It's simply an excuse for laziness.	0
"It is clearly self refuting. It's as self refuting as the statement: ""the vehicle I drive cannot be driven"". Besides that, why would you agree with a statement you don't think is true?"

I don't think anything is true or false, according to society you can dictate the two of them. A theory before it becomes a law is highly disputal idea that has flaws yet people agree with them.

"False equivalence. The right goes after the left for things like having sex and being born in Kenya. The left goes after the right for things like lying about WMDs to start a war. And it is a different tone with Obama. Because no one criticized Bush for being the ""dumb Texan"" president who can't read. No one ever accused Reagan of being a racist. Stop acting like Obama is the first president to be criticized over false and trivial things.  And the right would do themselves a whole lot of good if instead of letting this type of thing go on to keep that constituency happy, they instead did what McCain did in the 08 election when the crazy lady with the crazy hair said Obama wasn't a citizen in the debates. The Republicans are acting like Democrats. The average voter is fuck stupid, just accept it, so that's why you have Palin saying he's not a citizen and Biden saying that ""they gonna but ya'll back in chains""  Its not an isolated issue with Obama being black, its what happens it Republics where most voters spend about 5 minutes ""thinking"" about each election. I don't consider acknowledgment of a historical landmark ""special treatment."" Whether it is embarrassing that it took until 2008 for a black person to be seriously considered for the presidency, or a milestone, is debatable. It is one though, and that can be separated from consideration over his effectiveness I believe. You act as if it was illegal for blacks to be elected. This might come as a shock to you, but African-Americans are a MINORITY, do you know what that means? Yes David, it means that they make up a smaller percentage of the population meaning that the chance of a black being elected is lower because there are significantly less blacks then whites. Is it racism? No, its demographics, if you have 100 people and only 20 of them are black, there is only a 20% chance of someone black even running for office, let alone being elected over policy.  You act as if every time a black man runs for office everyone just starts screaming the N word. The first black senator did receive similar attacks. That more supports my and most people's theory that the ""he's not American, not like us, different, etc"" stems not from politics but from race though. Actually, no it doesn't. Back then it did, considering the civil war was not even a decade ago and there was VERY high racial tensions. Obama is not considered to be ""one of us"" because his views isolate most people, seriously, only 1 third of the voting population supported him in the election.  You missed the point by quoting a portion. His leniency on marijuana was the point, and the secondary point is that portion is not covered in right media. The libertarians whose philosophies of freedom extend to gays is not a large portion of that segment of the right wing for some reason, but any ""credit"" they may give Obama I've not heard. 1. Stop assuming that the entire right is Libertarian. Being Libertarian basically boils down to being Socially Liberal and Fiscally conservative. Stop confusing us with establishment Republicans that are against gay marriage and drugs, nothing pisses us off more! It would be like you saying ""I'm a member of the justice party"" and then me acting as if you were an establishment Democrat. 2.When it comes to real Libertarians almost all of the are either for gay marriage or share Ron Paul's view which was more or less just this: I think marriage is between man and a women, but why does the government have a say in who you can and can't marry? We have one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the world. Closing loopholes and raising taxes the suggested 3% would not change this. 2. Fine, leave. Find quality labor in another country if you think you can. Apparently they can, if they couldn't, India, China and Russia wouldn't be getting all our jobs. Spend the extra X on shipping to the U.S. instead of making things locally. News flash, Atlas Shrugs is utter bullshit. Any company that leaves there are 10 that are happy to take its place. Oh god, you still think its 1950. If there are 10 happy to take its place, then why aren't we seeing an influx of business? Why is everyone leaving? Why are people investing more and more in China, Russia and India instead of America?  You try and open up a business in China or Russia, the government meets you at the airport, finds you some workers and welcomes you. You try to open up a business in America, you fill out a ton of paperwork, wait a few months or years (in California it takes 2-5 years to start a business on average) then the government starts over regulating you and then on your way home you have a bunch of hipsters saying that you need to pay for all their stuff. Most investors will choose China or Russia.  When Obama <a href='http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/530761_441923539211451_1555509386_n.jpg'>does this investors take their capital and job creation to China and Russia.  The U.S. is the best place in the world to be in business unless you want to run a sweat shop, and I don't want any sweat shops in America. Yeah, and then people like you consider everything that isn't ""fair"" to be a sweat shop. This creates a permanent under class that is dependent on government. For those who aren't to bright and aren't to skilled, there are always low level jobs that they can work heir way up from, but where are they? Oh yeah, I forgot, you drove them over seas. Congrats, some hipster can make some face book status about fairness and everyone who would have worked those jobs is now unemployed, good job. Although sweat shops are bad, they are not as bad as you make them out to be. Seriously, China was a country of starving illiterates, then the ""Communist"" party opens up the free market, sweat shops open and up and suddenly China has the fastest growing economy and middle class in the world. A hard, low paying job that gives you work skills is better than no job and some foods stamps. And none of that has anything to do with the Affordable Care Act anyway. In a sense it does. Medicare is expensive and low quality, now you use the same system on the entire population... good job, you have now made the budget even more unbalance, cause congress to borrow more, the Federal Reserve to print more and for taxes to inevitably have to go up even more.  It saves money for rich people, poor people, and everyone in between. How so? Because it insurances no longer have to compete, raising their quality and lowering their prices? Doesn't sound like very much ""saving"" is going on there. The only people who have a legitimate reason, one based in reality and not fantasy, to not like the bill are insurance companies. Insurance companies are a huge part of the problem though, so fuck them. If you don't like them, then don't buy their insurance. If you are unhappy with a business you don't lobbying congress to run them out of business (unless you're a real asshole) you simply say ""I no longer wish to purchase your product/service, after I pay my next bill I am done with your business."" Was that hard? Nope. They've driven up costs to more than double per capita what any other country pays and they work harder to not cover the ill than they do to find treatment. Why would anyone care if they lose a couple million of their billions because they can't rip people off any more? Is it just me, or are democrats economically illiterate? Don't like the product or service? No? THEN DON'T FUCKING BUY IT! If you don't like one company, go to another, if you decide it is better to not use any of them, that's fine to."	"Because no one criticized Bush for being the ""dumb Texan"" president who can't read. No one ever accused Reagan of being a racist. Stop acting like Obama is the first president to be criticized over false and trivial things.  It's more than being criticized over trivial things though. No one questions a ""dumb Texan who can't read's"" patriotism, citizenship, or right to be president. There's a huge difference between parodying or making fun of a president and cultivating fear for the union and unabashed hatred based on a strawman or an imaginary character sitting in an empty chair at the RNC.  You act as if it was illegal for blacks to be elected. This might come as a shock to you, but African-Americans are a MINORITY, do you know what that means? Yes David, it means that they make up a smaller percentage of the population meaning that the chance of a black being elected is lower because there are significantly less blacks then whites. Is it racism? No, its demographics, if you have 100 people and only 20 of them are black, there is only a 20% chance of someone black even running for office, let alone being elected over policy. You act as if every time a black man runs for office everyone just starts screaming the N word. That's not even close to how I act. I simply better understand the deep racial divide sown into the conscious of our country. It doesn't mean it's as bad as the 60's or 50's or 40's or the 1800's, but pretending it does not exist today means you're blind to much of reality and it's hard to have a clear view of our society if you are not taking it into account. Actually, no it doesn't. Back then it did, considering the civil war was not even a decade ago and there was VERY high racial tensions. Obama is not considered to be ""one of us"" because his views isolate most people, seriously, only 1 third of the voting population supported him in the election. Utter bullshit. Percentage wise he had more votes than both of the last Republican presidents. The only people who feel ""isolated"" due to ""his views"" are idiots on the far right whose only idea of what ""his views"" are come from far right sources that do shit like yell at empty chairs at the RNC. 1. Stop assuming that the entire right is Libertarian. Being Libertarian basically boils down to being Socially Liberal and Fiscally conservative. Stop confusing us with establishment Republicans that are against gay marriage and drugs, nothing pisses us off more! It would be like you saying ""I'm a member of the justice party"" and then me acting as if you were an establishment Democrat. From what I've seen the only time ""libertarians"" vote or voice their opinion is when it is inline with the right. Libertarians will go to anti-Obama gun rallies in hordes, not a one will be represented at a gay rights protest. Like it or not, that is Libertarian. You want people to start thinking differently about that segment of the Republican party? Well, stop marching in step with them on everything. 2.When it comes to real Libertarians almost all of the are either for gay marriage or share Ron Paul's view which was more or less just this: I think marriage is between man and a women, but why does the government have a say in who you can and can't marry? Exactly. So why bother doing anything if it's just gay people's rights? Oh wait, they want us to have five less bullets in our gun!!!? Time to start talking about cession again!  It's a fucking media stunt. It's a way of pretending ""hey, I'm not a nerdy republican stuck in the past"" while still being stuck in the past when it comes to actual action on anything. Apparently they can, if they couldn't, India, China and Russia wouldn't be getting all our jobs. They aren't getting all of our jobs, they're getting a handful of our crappy jobs no one wants, and they are only getting those because of republican policies that reward corporations that move over seas and because of decades of republican and democratic rollbacks on import taxation. Charge equivalent duties to every other nation on earth and not only will those jobs come back, we can actually raise the minimum wage so people who work 40hrs+ per week don't need the welfare the right is always crying about. Oh god, you still think its 1950. If there are 10 happy to take its place, then why aren't we seeing an influx of business? Why is everyone leaving? Why are people investing more and more in China, Russia and India instead of America? See above. And yeah there are at least ten. If McDonalds or Walmart shut their doors tomorrow not a person in the U.S. will want for cheap products or fast food. Not a single one. The right needs to quit treating every company like a deity. Some are okay, some are fucking awful, and maybe 1/1,000 is the least bit special. You try and open up a business in China or Russia, the government meets you at the airport, finds you some workers and welcomes you. You try to open up a business in America, you fill out a ton of paperwork, wait a few months or years (in California it takes 2-5 years to start a business on average) then the government starts over regulating you and then on your way home you have a bunch of hipsters saying that you need to pay for all their stuff. So you think America should find companies slave labor like Russia and China? Libertarian must = freedom for Ltd, fuck the people, put them in chains! And your exaggerating to a retarded extent. Have you ever tried to start a business? Even in CA? You can do it in an afternoon unless you are trying to get some kind of special treatment or doing something you need special permits for. And if you are a company complaining about regulations I can only assume you are doing shit like throwing your waste in the local water supply and putting cabbage with Salmonella on grocery store counters. Do shit the right way and the regulations aren't a problem. Yeah, and then people like you consider everything that isn't ""fair"" to be a sweat shop. This creates a permanent under class that is dependent on government. For those who aren't to bright and aren't to skilled, there are always low level jobs that they can work heir way up from, but where are they? Oh yeah, I forgot, you drove them over seas. Congrats, some hipster can make some face book status about fairness and everyone who would have worked those jobs is now unemployed, good job. Real simple solution then, pay fair wages and charge comparable import taxes. Problem solved. Hipsters are happy and there are more jobs in America.  What creates a permanent underclass is when you lower wages then take away public schools so even the kids can't rise above their parents economic status... which is the direct result of conservative fiscal policies of pay the people less so they can work at more shitty jobs that don't pay enough to live, give giant companies who move jobs overseas huge incentive to move more jobs overseas, oh yeah, also now that you have all these great jobs that don't pay the bills, we're going to make you pay for school out of your pocket.  Although sweat shops are bad, they are not as bad as you make them out to be. Seriously, China was a country of starving illiterates, then the ""Communist"" party opens up the free market, sweat shops open and up and suddenly China has the fastest growing economy and middle class in the world. A hard, low paying job that gives you work skills is better than no job and some foods stamps. Wtf? Fuck that. 1. China is full of shit about their middle class. There is no middle class in China. That's propaganda. 2. People don't work in those places by choice, they do so because they have to. People should not have to work in those conditions. Companies should be made to compete for labor, not labor competing for companies. This is what creates a middle, which is what drives economies, which ironically is what actually makes businesses rich if they could see past their next quarter returns for five minutes. In a sense it does. Medicare is expensive and low quality, now you use the same system on the entire population... good job, you have now made the budget even more unbalance, cause congress to borrow more, the Federal Reserve to print more and for taxes to inevitably have to go up even more. Completely false. Medicare is far more cost effective than any private insurance. And it is of equal quality. They see the same doctors and go to the same hospitals as the average joe with insurance. The fact, fact fact fucking fact is that every single country in the world with not-for-profit healthcare spends less money on healthcare and has better healthcare. That is a fact. The reason is because a for-profit system for something which is a necessity is a assbackwards poor way to do things. You and prayerfails are always talking about ""coercion"" but when it is private insurance doing this you are all for it. That's what it is. No one is going to be on their deathbed and say ""ah shoot, that's too pricey, guess I'll just die"" and we shouldn't want them to. So insurance is able to charge whatever the hell they want and if they can't pay it, which they can't, it comes out of the taxes we pay anyway, but with a huge markup. So insurance had their chance for decades and turns out they are greedy assholes who don't mind if a few tens-of-thousands of people die each year if they can charge a little more, be a little more exclusive, decide at the last minute not to cover this or that treatment, then stick the rest of the country with the bill when hospitals have the choice of letting someone die or giving them the treatment they need to live but that isn't covered and that they can't afford. So instead, you make sure as many people are insured as possible so far fewer people get in that expensive life and death situation, you cap what insurance can charge, you determine, since it's a necessity not a luxury that only X% can be profit, and tada, you save more people, all healthcare goes down for everyone since now more people are covered and they are healthier overall, and the poor poor insurance companies only make a few billion in profit instead of a hundred billion. I prefer a universal system, but this at least is better."	0
A criminal punished for the extent of his crimes. If you believe that a petty thief deserves to go to the same place as a mass murderer then I don't know what to tell you. As for your rebuttal to my argument, pathetic. You did not disprove my logic, what the basis for their actions were is irrelevant. You must believe that the Nazi's treatment of the Jews was just if you are willing to advocate a worse punishment	A criminal punished for the extent of his crimes. If you believe that a petty thief deserves to go to the same place as a mass murderer then I don't know what to tell you. The smallest of sins deserves death. The largest of sins can't merit a larger punishment, since the largest punishment is already death. So all sin earns one the same punishment. As for your rebuttal to my argument, pathetic. Do you not think that criminals should be tried and sentenced? You did not disprove my logic, what the basis for their actions were is irrelevant. You must believe that the Nazi's treatment of the Jews was just if you are willing to advocate a worse punishment This does not follow. I do not believe in the unjust killing of someone, which is what Hitler did, since he killed not out of morality, but out of malice and hatred. I believe in the just killing of someone, which is equivalent to the death penalty. If it is murder, then it is killing. Do not make the mistake of affirming the consequent; simply because it is killing, it does not make it murder.	0
Fuck no, you ho banging piece of shit! ;)	Too bad we can't have a Dana-filter. ;)	0
Yes. That's what natural selection is for. Chill it out and let evolution do its thang.	Only problem with that idea is that we as a species are really good at screwing with natural selection. If nature had its way then every time some idiot did something that has the potential to kill them then eventually they would die and the species would be better off. However, with advances in medical technology these stupid people have to try extra hard in order to possibly kill themselves and that has caused their genes to stay in the gene pool. Then they reproduce at a faster rate then people who are not stupid and it starts to get to the point where evolution is not even the correct term to describe it, it's more like reverse evolution.	0
From Dr. Peter Hammond's book: Slavery, Terrorism and Islam: The Historical Roots and Contemporary Threat. Islam its fullest form, it is a complete, total100% system of life. Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well. Here's how it works: As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in: United States -- Muslim 0..6% Australia -- Muslim 1.5% Canada -- Muslim 1.9% China -- Muslim 1.8% Italy -- Muslim 1.5% Norway -- Muslim 1.8% At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in: Denmark -- Muslim 2% Germany -- Muslim 3.7% United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7% Spain -- Muslim 4% Thailand -- Muslim 4.6% From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in: France -- Muslim 8% Philippines -- 5% Sweden -- Muslim 5% Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3% The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5% Trinidad & Tobago -- Muslim 5.8% At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world. When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Is lam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in: Guyana -- Muslim 10% India -- Muslim 13.4% Israel -- Muslim 16% Kenya -- Muslim 10% Russia -- Muslim 15% After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burning of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in: Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8% At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in: Bosnia -- Muslim 40% Chad -- Muslim 53.1% Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7% From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in: Albania -- Muslim 70% Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4% Qatar -- Muslim 77.5% Sudan -- Muslim 70% After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in: Bangladesh -- Muslim 83% Egypt -- Muslim 90% Gaza -- Muslim 98.7% Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1% Iran -- Muslim 98% Iraq -- Muslim 97% Jordan -- Muslim 92% Morocco -- Muslim 98.7% Pakistan -- Muslim 97% Palestine -- Muslim 99% Syria -- Muslim 90% &n;bsp;Tajikistan -- Muslim 90% Turkey -- Muslim 99.8% United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96% 100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace.. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in: Afghanistan -- Muslim 100% Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100% Somalia -- Muslim 100% Yemen -- Muslim 100% Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons. Understand that in some countries, with well under 100% Muslim populations, such as France, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these ghettos. There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrasses. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death.	Yes, good arguement, but it says 'muslim extremists' not muslims.	0
"._. Two unpaid for wars and a retarded tax cut that only helped the rich ""has crushed the American economy"" Since a moderate liberal has taken office, the economy has improved incredibly in fact. Edit Ah, that is the definition... one of them. Who decided on that term? Should it not be Neo-Conservatism or something?"	Ah, that is the definition... one of them. Who decided on that term? Should it not be Neo-Conservatism or something? Nope, it would be neo-liberalism. You see, for most of American history being liberal meant being a classical liberal (essentially what libertarianism is today) and it stayed that way up until the very end of the 1800's. During the progressive era the term liberal got changed from meaning someone who was in favor of limited government, free markets and civil liberties to someone who was in favor of large government, regulated markets and some civil liberties (not including the right to have a drink) and that is when liberal started meaning what it means today.	0
She may be onto something by stating that Obama's father was never a US citizen! I don't know if that is a requirement to be President of the USA or not. Does it go by where the father was born or simply where the off-spring was born? But Ms. Taitz does sound a bit of the lunatic and I can't really blame her for answering the way she did because of the network time restraints. They certainly didn't give her enough time to answer a fairly large question thoroughly.	Obama's father's citizenship would only be an issue if Obama had not been born in the US.  As it is, however, he was born in the US, so it's a moot point.	0

The child will not stop its negative behavior it will only find ways around being caught. It will grow up with the knowledge planted in its brain that it is OK to be violent when you deem it necessary and a contempt for authority. Lol slimey liberals... Tell me which generations received more beatings.. the older or the younger? Tell me which generation is more respectful Tell me which generation has more respect for authority (and thus less contempt) Tell me which generation has more of the qualities as good people Spanking a child only teaches them that 'being violent' is only ok in the same circumstance. Spanking him/her because he swore at his mother doesn't mean he'll go out and stab an old lady. It teaches him that swearing at his mother is wrong... and in the future if anybody else does that.. they will get a spank. Btw I don't really like spanking. A nice slap around the face is much quicker and easier.	Tell me which generation is more respectful Respectful to what? Life, I don't think so. Which generation dropped Nuclear Bombs on Highly populated cities? Which generation invented terrorism? Think of the atrocities in Northern Ireland. Which generation is in authority now propagating the new crusades in the middle east? Which generation subjected Black people, Homosexuals to torturous discrimination. I could go on, the matter as it stands is the youth of today are disassociated with society, in most cases both mother and father are working due to a capitalist society created by the previous generations, leaving their children to be raised without the authority that they need and lacking the social skills necessary to regard their parents in a respectful light.  The problem does not lay on the fact that children are not being hit, it rests on the fact that they are being denied their role models. Society is crumbling under the strains of big business, global catastrophe, open ended wars and growing contempt. Too little emphasis is placed on the runaway consequences of turning away from human issues to sort out a mess that has no end.  Your methods of deduction are astounding, I never stated that a person if they were spanked would go and stab an old lady, a person that wants to stab an old lady will do so with out the motivation of having just been spanked.	0
"I'm against any standard currency world-wide. Currency should be a gradual creation through market cooperation; not a standardization based on flawed principals that only become harder to fix over time. All ""perfect"" systems are made bottom-up (unless you believe in God... but hey, that's a different topic). So to say that a government entity can decide what form of currency is perfect for civilization is saying that somehow government can control inflation rates and can enforce this standard of currency without wreaking havoc (cause, hey, the Great Depression never happened and we're currently not in ass-raping debt). Now, the Gold standard I will say is superior to paper money or electronic money because it is a mostly limited product. You can not make more gold (so easily), so inflation rates would rarely ever go up. The main problem, however, comes from the problem of standard currency in general. There is no assurance that wealth can accumulate accordingly with the resources that come into play at random times. If a business is able to mine many resources all of a sudden, they are at a far more significant advantage for they have accumulated all the wealth. With currency being the standard, the poor would depend on that paper money instead of proper allocation of those resources. It comes down to a sort of corporatist, crony mentality to have any standard currency for it encourages top-down management. In some ways, it is secure to have factories where labor is paid with arbitrary dollars, but in other ways that is the only way it would be. When you standardize currency, you greatly eliminate the flexibility of wealth. So I'm against any standard currency. But I prefer Gold to dollars for the sake of practicality and lowering Keynes type inflation rates."	Gold and silver were originally commodities because of their inherent traits, tested my market forces. Gold and silver are a 1) medium of exchange 2) unit of account 3) portable 4) divisible 5) durable 6) fungible 7) store of value (currency doesn't have this) throughout the ages, just about everything was used as a medium of exchange because they had to overcome the dual coincidence of exchange. If I want eggs, then the egg guy needs to want my stuff. This almost never happened so I would have to go get a whole chain of supplies just to get what I want. usually, luxury items becomes money. In prisons, cigarettes become money naturally on their own. through 5000 years, gold and silver were proven to be the best money, and governments still inflate by mixing the gold/silver with different metals and recasting them (rome did this and fell). With gold and silver, the prices of things tends to deflate at about 3% a year because of the capital investments made to make production more efficient. I think you are against fiat currency, but in favor of market currency. Market proven currency is gold and silver.  If you see the spot price of gold and silver for the past 3 years, it was about to go parabolic, before the government started to manipulate the spot price via naked short selling. It's all about to change.	0
"In ""Animal Farm"" the quot used in the question, to my knowledge, does not mean equality of handicaps, but that everyone should be treated the same, but some better than others. so i feel like your answer does not really answer the question."

Please post these. I've been arguing under the impression that the death penalty was having a negligible affect on crime rates, but a report showing the opposite would definitely make a difference in my stance."	Firstly appeals have to be reviewed before the actual trial can take place and the actual trial will take place if the defendant is believed to be innocent or was unfair in the jugdement passed dowm by the court. Why are we even arguing about expenses when we are not even spending money on it? The results of the death penalty has supercede the results of imprisonment. OK. According to a study done by Robert Dann in 1935, he created the thoery that the death penalty had no effect on the murder rate but in fact increased the murder rate. But in a later and more advanced study done by Daniel Dezbaksh, etal, ,the death penalty actually deterred murder in states that have higher executions than the norm. According to this study, when the executions of the state was higher, the murder rate was lower and when the execution rate was lower, the murder rate was higher. Frequent executions according to this study, acted as a constant reminder to the punishment of murder. To prove that this study is accurate and that the first study is inaccurate as found in the second study, i present you with the results in the form of a graph released by The Bureau Of Criminal Justice This is the link; <a href='http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#deter'>http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#deter  The above link contains strong information supporting the deterrent effect of the death penalty including a look at the graph released by the Criminal Justice Bureau. Since you think abortion is so right then maybe you should also know that abortion was leagized due to a lie in which Jane Roe, the mother and champion of legalized abortion, was being prosecuted by the D.

Jane Roe appealed against the lower court's decision by challenging the D.A in The U.S Supreme Court and claimed that she was raped and due to that she wanted an abortion. The Supreme Court ruled that the state has no right to infringe on the privacy of a woman. After this ruling, Jane Roe later came out and said that she was not raped but had consensual sex in which she used rape as an excuse to get rid of the child. Today Jane Roe is still alive, against abortion and still gave birth to the child she was supposed to abort. This case later known as the root and origin of legalized abortion later became the case known as Roe v. Wade.	0
The number of Children should be the decision of each individual,and God said be fruitful, and multiply. I think that is simple.We should plan for the kingdom of God that is eternal even as this universe is eternal. We do that by allowing the perfect love of Jesus in us to make us a new creature in Christ loving all even as we love ourselves.	Gos also commanded you to kill people who pick up sticks on Sunday, and kill people of other religions and to stone someone who plants two different crops next to each other but you don't do that do you? So according to you, humans should just breed like rabbits until we procreate ourselves into rampant starvation and poverty, however the earth is not eternal and there is no eternal food and resource supply.	0

"Let me first make clear that I am not religious. I consider myself to be an Agnostic. I do not know if God exists, you don't either. So I am not ranting on about MY religions, as you put it. Now let me make this clear, what you have just said to me is complete and utter bullshit. You do not understand what you are talking about. You are not born with morals. You gain your morals as you grow. HA! So I'm sure before Christianity everyone just killed everyone and had a great time of it!  Do you think Christianity was the first religion? Christianity came after Christ. You are aware of Judaism, Hinduism, Paganism, and Greek Mythology... right? These are the world's first religions (the most well known from before Christianity). Now I don't know very much about Paganism, but I do know that these religions all taught important morals for the followers to live their lives by. It is also a well known fact that the world was a much more violent place back then. Maybe they didn't have a ""great time"" killing others, but they had many stonings and public executions, as well as many wars.  I don't need religion to tell me what's right and what's wrong in life. Open your eyes man, it already has! Maybe your parents are athiest, but are your grandparents? If they are, then were their parents? The list could go on, but at some point in your bloodline is a follower of a certain religion. Take the middle ages for example. That time period was governed by the church in Europe. They did not believe in science, only in what the Bible said. We obviously live more healthy, productive lives now, but the morals were still passed down. The Bible, or any religious text, don't necessarily guide all of your choices, but they do for most of the moral choices. The ten commandments probably guide a lot of how you live. Adultery is a good example. You see that as wrong, don't you? But why? Or lying... Do you find that to be immoral? Read the Ten Commandments. You will find that you live your life by most, if not all of them. You get a three year old and give it a hamster. That three year old has never heard of God or Jesus before, yet it knows that killing the hamster is bad. The three year old doesn't kill the hamster, because he/she was taught that killing is wrong by her parent(s)/guardian(s). You can rant on about your religions to me you're not going to convince me. Like I said before, they are not MY religions. I am not religious. Considering the fact that you are an athiest, you obviously base your beliefs on facts. Well it is a FACT that our morals are based off religions.  I know, for a fact, I did not get my morals from religion. I am an atheist, and I have had morals since the day I was born, and I will have them until the day I die. If you know this for a fact, why don't you prove it to me? This is your chance to blow the lid off the whole ""morals came from religions"" debate we are having here. How could you have been born with morals? Is it your soul that came pre-programmed with morals? Well that sounds kind of like something a religious person would say... Kind of a strange argument for an athiest."	Prove what to you?! You give me some solid proof that it DOES! The proof I have is that, basically, there is no religion to have given me morals. And trust me, there is much more solid proof showing religion doesn't exist as appose to a bunch of brainwashed morons who believe on walking and water and all that crap!	0
"First, there is a gaping giant chasm between ""it musn't exist"" and ""there's no reason to believe it exists"". I take the latter position, not the former. I have absolutely no problem accepting any of the things you listed as theoretical possibilities. But there is NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE they actually exist so going past ""theoretical posibility"" to ""believing they exist"" isn't a supportable position. UFO sightings is a perfect example actually. Lots of people constantly claiming to have seen one, and yet somehow nobody EVER gets conclusive evidence of a sighting. EVER. Not once does someone get one on video where it doesn't turn out to be either a hoax or someone shooting a high flying plane or some grainy blurry ... uhh... light... or something... WHICH IS TOTALLY A UFO!!!!! WE SWEAR!!!! If these things are zipping around in view of millions of people you'd think just once someone would point a camera at one and get a decent image. Yet somehow that never seems to happen. That should tell you something. And no, the options aren't ""either it's real or people are lying"". People think they see things they didn't really see all the time. This we know FOR A FACT. It's is entirely possible for people to be wrong you know. Lying is not the only option. I have a friend who once swore up and down that she saw Arnold Schwarzenegger at a beach in Canada. She didn't, I know this because I know from news sources he was somewhere else at the time.  She wasn't lying, she just thought she saw something she didn't. It happens. A LOT. And yes, there are innumerable accounts of all those things you listed. So tell me why not ONE SINGLE PERSON can demonstrate one of them under conditions where we can verify they're not faking it? If after all these abilities are apparently so widespread that we hear about them all the time... where exactly are these people when it's time to put up or shut up?"	Most of what you said is similar to what I tell others for certain 'phenomena'. However, I still chose to believe millions of witnesses despite the absence of 'empirical' evidence. Page two of the 'science' category has a section on 'Mother's psychic instinct'. The site is filled with many other documented paranormal phenomena. One more thing: When the government gets wind of it, they'll say that the 'UFO' was one of two things: A weather balloon or a plane refueling.	0

I slightly disagree. I think obesity is actually a bigger problem than crack when you consider it in terms of how many die of heart disease compared to crack, how many don't know how to eat compared to how many people are addicted to crack. Peope know crack is bad, they don't know in large part which foods are. My stance is from what I've seen and what I hear from people trying to lose weight, very fat people think it's natural and there is nothing they can do about it because they think the way they eat is normal in large part. This begins at a young age. Everyone thinks they know how to eat, but it's never taught, they just keep eating as they did as a kid and wonder why they get fat. So why not teach them how to eat at a young age?  Whether a kid hordes soda at home is an issue with the parents, and they need to get their fat kid under control. That kid doesn't represent the whole though.	Obesity is a problem but banning sweets from school doesn't teach them anything, and it punishes the students who can eat sweets in moderation. Banning things in general almost never stops the things it intends to stop. In my view: Eating in Moderation > Prohibition of sweets Banning sweets only elevates them to a Forbidden Fruit status, which makes kids want them even more.	0

If they choose not to believe in God then they send themselves to hell due to what they choose out of free will.	0
Science isn't about proving why something doesn't exist, it's about proving it does exist. That's like saying Flying pink elephants can exist on a far away planet, because science hasn't disproved it. Silly thing to say. has science proved it? No, then don't say 'it exists, and that is a fact'.  And so far, science has by no means proved God's existence.	"Failed to produce any evidence. I did not ask for what science does. People claim to have evidence that points to his non existence. Show me the evidence. You posted on ""Here is the evidence"" so show it to me. Otherwise don't bother responding."	0
Actually, they learn English from first grade to college. :) It's really not that different from American culture. They speak English, use the same currency as us, and understand our system of government. They even have a spot in Congress, although as of now they do not have an official vote.	I've actually met tons of people from Puerto Rico (at my old school), most of them did not know english and the ones who did knew very little, not even enough to understand simple things. It is true that people tell them English will be vital to their education, however most do not learn the language anyway.	0

"Abortion's hotness is because of the fact that people are killing fetuses. Nothing to do with the gender. Now, I feel that if men had the ability to get pregnant, I suppose women would just have far less of importance in society itself. This really could make so many other issues of humanity different, but not the issue of abortion. I am very much pro-choice, but that's because of my classically liberal mentality of keeping government out of most issues. I don't know how I feel about allowing people to kill fetuses and if it's consistent with maintaining individual rights, but my Nihilism just takes over and says ""w/e, it's not even sentient."" Abortion, as much as it would help out liberals to say so, isn't about sexism. And while many religious people are against abortion, many are in support of it (let's face it, most people are religious.) Hell, even embryonic stem cell research is controversial."	Since you want government out of most issues then I can assume that you are 100% against Obamacare. Afterall, the government should not be involved in a familys finances. Thats government interference. Surely you cant want to keep the government out of the bedroom and let them into the living room. Please dont give me that health care effects so many people and abortion does not. Millions of people would love to adopt but cant because of the waiting list and the huge cost. If abortion were illegal then so many people would not be childless.	0
"People who claim to have no religion are liars or don't understand what religion is. While I see in one of your replies you decided to take one of the definitions of religious and define that one point: #4 A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. I think you know (at least I hope you do) that words can come to mean multiple things that are loosely related, or not related at all. Since atheists seem to be the subject you are discussing, the proper definition of religion for this debate is: Noun (n) religion, faith, religious belief (a strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control human destiny) ""he lost his faith but not his morality"" (n) religion, faith, organized religion (an institution to express belief in a divine power) ""he was raised in the Baptist religion""; ""a member of his own faith contradicted him"" I think it could easily be said that one is both an atheist, and at the same time may or may not do something ""religiously"". I religiously brush my death twice a day. I don't believe that my toothbrush is my creator. Hence, me atheist, me do things ""religiously"" in spite of this. I assure you the vast vast majority of atheists understand what it means to be atheist very well. I mean, you say you are an atheist. Let me ask you, do you at least try your hardest to breathe when you need oxygen no matter what? Well, that would mean you breathe ""religiously"" Hence by your own definition you are not an atheist at all. ... well hopefully you see your error."	I think you know (at least I hope you do) that words can come to mean multiple things that are loosely related, or not related at all. being atheist I obviously prefer definitions of the word that are also atheistic. ... well hopefully you see your error. I do not see my error. I would like to.. by respectful debate have it (them) clearly exposed. I don't think you have clearly expressed why you disagree.	0
What sources are you talking about? In all these months I've never seen anyone in the newpapers or online say he was dead. When a Kennedy dies, especially the last of the brothers you're going to see it and hear about it big time. I don't think half of you realize who he was and what type of family he came from. Even his mother made headlines when she died several years ago. The coverage on this will be a large as he was, you can bet that.	Isn't he getting buried on the same day as Michael Jackson? I know I'll be watching that circus over Ted's ;)	0
"How true this is. Religion doesn't have to be based upon God, it can be based upon a god. Albert Einstein once was asked what his religion was and his answer is as follows; ""My work is my religion, I work religiously."" Whatever is the center of your life is your religion. One's god can be almost anything. For some that god is alcohol, gambling, drugs, work, sex, computer games, etc. If you worship it, it is your god."	Why do I have to have a god. I reject the theory of god and because I play computer games and gamble those are my gods.	0

There are different stages in communist theory dealing with different stages in reality. The stage of a classless stateless society will not have a capitalist economy, however the stages before that may find communists working against, within, or even for various forms of capitalism. So you agree then that when diversity is accepted it makes the community or state strong. It seems weakness comes more so when people try to squash diversity, rather then accept it.  Testing an idea against various theoretical models allows for better empirical tests. It allows you to know the important points of conflict to test for. When a theory is considered perfect and not tested against other theories then what points of the theory to test are not as clear. If a theory considered as perfect and is unchallenged by other ideas is to be tested empirically then those tests are going to be of a lesser quality, potentially not even testing for what could be a major flaw.  Germany was strong, however wouldn't they of been stronger if they would of recruited more of the people they persecuted into their army or military complex somehow? For example they could of had the atomic bomb if Einstein wasn't threatened by them.    The Romans allowed local laws to stay in place when they conquered a people, not much changed but the army of the area. The USA has been the only superpower for awhile.	Sorry for the wait, I didn't get notified. =/ To be honest I wasn't debating this point because I felt strongly for it or anything, either could be argued so I picked a side mostly just for practice. Though, since I'm going to be stupid busy for the next little while I've got to cut back on some of my ongoing debates.  Soooo I propose this; both diversity and conformity can strengthen a group depending on the context of the situation. Agreed?	0
"Plants without THC are not illegal, there is whole industry around that. SO because alcohol and tobacco are legal and addictive lets legalize another danger drug? Is this how your ""logic"" works? Every illegal drug is an effective pain relief, that's not reason to legalize them, isn't it?"	Please supply proof because everything I have read says that Marijuana is illegal full stop, to grow a plant without THC you need to start with seeds that contains THC which is illegal it's once the plant is growing that you genetically modify it to removeve the THC.  My logic works on the basis that the war on drugs as it is is not working so legalise Pot as it has proven medicinal use and is less harmful than stuff thats already legal then concentrate on the dangerous drugs. It'll take money out of the drug dealers pockets, free up space in overcrowded prisons and money from Police budgets that can then be used to combat stuff that poses a real threat like Heroin and Crack. Why do you call it a danger drug, no-one has died from a Pot overdose and contrary to what people would have you believe it is not a gateway drug.	0

If the assumptions are made that democracy is the preferable form of government and that the dictator is tyrannical and harmful, then the assassination of a dictator is not the solution to the problem. It is important to note that not all dictators are bad for their countries. For example, Stalin, despite being ruthless and cruel, made the Soviet Union into a superpower that helped defeat fascism and has provided continued economic benefits all over Europe and central Asia to this day. Killing Stalin wouldn't have really solved anything. Despite Stalin's strength as a leader, it was ultimately the failings of the system that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Killing the leader doesn't change the country, the solution to dictatorships is a re-structuring of government. In Russia, the collapse of the soviet system did not cause the death of their premier, just as the death of the premier would not cause a change in the system.	The topic however is whether the assassination of a dictator can be justified. So to use your logics, it can be justified if the following happens: The dictator is killed, followed by a change in the system to a more democratic form of government.	0

"Historians put Wilson in the top 5, he imprisoned Suffragists, anti-war protesters, anti-draft protesters, socialist and signed the Federal Reserve Act which has ruined the worth of the dollar. Historians put FDR in the top 5, he put Japanese American citizens in concentration camps, let the USSR take half of Germany and Eastern Europe and dragged out the great depression. Just because some historians that work for PBS say ""this guy is great"" doesn't mean they are actually great.  And yes, Obama will go up there because he is black, I know you're going to put your hands over your ears, close your eyes and yell ""Its not true! Its not true!"" but it is, whenever you have the first leader of a nation that is of a different race/gender/ethnicity, they go down in history. Not claiming its right or logical, but hey, even if they can't find a way to make this guy look good, he will still go down as ""The First African-American President Ever"" so yes, it will have to with his race."	that was part of the original excitement, but its more to do with the way he relates to people and the balance and fairness of most of his policies. the vast majority think hes a decent man. very few politicians can have that said about them	0
Noah's ark has been found found already on Mt.Ararat so what are you talking about and why do you need proof for everything freaking thing I don't care if there is no proof of Jesus ever existing or Noah's Ark. The same way if you had a daughter or son and they said your uncle or best friend molested them you can see the pain in their eyes even before you go to a Doctor to get evidence because you don't need damn evidence to tell you what or who you believe. I'm sorry my punctuation sucks I'm in my last year of high school and all my English teachers sucked all we did was read crappy stories like Romeo and Juliette also the iPad makes corrections on its own. Honestly if there is anyone that doesn't believe in love I feel bad for them and I can do is pray because that means they never had anyone who loved them and they never loved anyone in return.	It has? Please direct me to the evidence of this happening, as I was not aware of this. I require proof because I cannot believe something if there's not evidence to back it up. If my daughter was molested by my uncle, it's a different category as that is a personal depiction, where as the Bible is a written depiction. If my daughter is showing signs of molestation, I'd know. No worries on the punctuation, I'm not one to judge. Just a year ago I would have had similar grammar to RandomDude. As long as I can read it, I'm not overly concerned.

You just think that anyone who doesn't compliment the liberals or trash talk the conservatives is spreading conservative propaganda... the video however, is total bullshit.

Healthcare will cost more. -It will lead to a ""doctor-shortage"" do to government control over their decisions. Nearly half of all doctors have said they may quit if Obamacare goes into effect. -It will cost around $2 Trillion, leading to an even larger deficit. Those are just a few of the cons. Again he ended the war in Iraq just because we are going to war with Syria doesn't mean we did not end the war in Iraq. The enemy we were fighting in Iraq, is still our current enemy. It was called ""The War IN Iraq"" for a reason. The enemy is spread throughout the Middle East. Bush increased the debt by 105% he doubled the debt. And also the debt has been dropping since 2012.

I understand the argument for a gold standard, I think that it won't allow for the type of growth and large economy we have now through. I also don't see how it would stop factional reserve banking, which is one of our main issues and has more to do with inflation than anything. But that is another debate.  Lets return to the original idea that if everyone started using gold for currency, its value would decrease. At face value, yes you would expect its value to actually increase under such a situation. And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on. Industry will seek out less expensive metals to use in their products, lowering demand, etc. The point I merely wish to make is that there are multiple processes which go on, some which raise the value due to increase demand, and others which are often less in magnitude and take longer to have effect, which lower the value due to increase in demand.	"""And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on.""  I'd like to request the source of your information for this statement. Because in my reading of economic history of the past 5000 years, it's been governments who seek out less expensive metals over time, not the minting companies, not the industry. Only governments can force people to accept this metal swapping for same value. Only governments can force people to accept this fraud; the classic bait and switch.  Gersham's law - ""Bad money drives out good money if the exchange rate is set by law"". You see, it's nearly impossible to make people accept something as something else. You can't force people to accept a knockoff if there are other competitors who offer the real deal. To block out competitors is by definition a monopoly, which is IMPOSSIBLE in a free market. Even predatory pricing and such will injure, cripple or maim a company attempting it. Only government can create monopolies (joining of economics and state), and by definition, government IS a monopoly and MUST be a monopoly. You can't have two conflicting constitutions in the same community (prelude to anarchy)."	0

I agree, let bad companies fail. Oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. I guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? So, when a small business fails, what does the government?  Oh, who gives fuck, you nobody? Nobody lets companies grow so big, they grow big due to demand and government helps them go bigger by regulations.	"So, when a small business fails, what does the government? Oh, who gives fuck, you nobody? Basically. That IS what you advocate. Nobody lets companies grow so big, they grow big due to demand and government helps them go bigger by regulations. Big businesses form naturally from an unregulated market and unregulated business practices. They secure their assets by buying political favours. So it is a natural consequence of free market and lack of regulations that increasing regulations will emerge as businesses start to play politics for their favour. Soon we have laws like ""margarine must be died pink"" or ""copying movies is highly illegal"" that stem from decades of power struggles."	0

This is more inherently true of mainstream media, which is bankrolled by organizations who constantly filter what they report in the name of money than in the search of truth, than it is for independent sources. Publishing something online is cheap enough (quite often free) that people can do it without having to worry how they are going to pay rent next month. I grant you that this does tend to lead to disinformation, but one can fact check and use logic to weed such stuff out. ""Social networks, aren't they for cackle hens?""  Social networking sites aren't just for meeting new people, although we are welcome to do so if we wish. It can allow us to obtain near-immediate updates on the lives of people we already know who we don't get to see often. I am much more in contact with my extended family on facebook than I would be otherwise.  ""So much of the information on the Internet is disinformation."" More like ""so much information on the Internet is stuff you disagree with"". I already admitted that information online can be disinformation, but again, there are ways around it. Don't let a few bad apples ruin the barrel for you.  ""What is in print, is at least consistent."" Never in the history of humankind has that ever been true. And consistency does not equate to truth anyway. Someone can be consistently wrong. And format does not have anything to do with veracity.  ""Entertainment means nothing to me, I have in search of knowledge not games."" Knowledge is an admirable quest, it is my top use of the internet. But the occasional game or movie can have emotional benefit. And I sometimes like to listen to new music while I educate myself."	0

Maybe he prefers to have a vagina as opposed to a penis? He has no preference. He's only experienced life with a penis. maybe he prefers to be pregnant than his partner? That's impossible. He was born a male.  We were born with these body parts but, he wants to control his life and change them. Well, duh... doesn't make it any less weird.  How is that any different than what clothes we decide to wear? We weren't born wearing clothes. Clothes don't reproduce. Changing clothes is not like changing genders.	How is changing clothes not like changing genders? We are control of our own lives and if we want to change ourselves we have all right to do so.	0
"Technically speaking, the definition of murder is to kill another person. A person by definition is a human being. Scientifically, a human is a mammal. Mammals are a classification of a type of animal. Essentially humans are animals. Murder is killing a human, which is an animal, so yes killing a animal is murder. HOWEVER, only if the animal which is killed is a human being. However, killing an animal is still immoral. The only answer seen as justified by society is ""survival""."	"Okay, obviously humans are animals. Then are you asking ""Is (human as an animal) killing an animal (human as an animal) murder?  Then in America and other places, obviously it is considered murder..  Wait, what question are you referring to again? lol this is a joke."	0
"Using ""gay"" as an insult suggests homophobia in the user. How would you like it if someone said ""that is so straight""?"	Welllll, on the internet the use of the word gay has become so loosely that I do not even think it has the same meaning as it use to (as in a mean term for a homosexual).	0
"Do you consider the men who flew the planes into the twin towers to be raving lunatics, in addition to being homicidal maniacs? Sure I do. But there were only 12 of them. most of the religious insanity and most of the insanely religious people that has/have existed throughout history (we're talking upwards of 98%) existed before the USA even existed as a country I think that's an interesting point. This isn't exactly a counter-argument but a rhetorical question: It it religious fanaticism when it's the norm? So some extent, I wonder if the ""fanatics"" of history were in fact not so odd at all and that their religious fervor might've been considered reasonable normal for their time. That's just a though I'm having after your comment. I've got no idea what the answer is."	"Sure I do. Then you must admit that being a raving lunatic is not the sole province of Americans.  It it religious fanaticism when it's the norm? So some extent, I wonder if the ""fanatics"" of history were in fact not so odd at all and that their religious fervor might've been considered reasonable normal for their time. That's just a though I'm having after your comment. I've got no idea what the answer is. Interesting question. I doubt they we're considered fanatics at the time, but they are by todays standards.  But more to the point: So you assert: Theistic and atheistic insanity is purely an American thing So I refute: But what about theistic and atheistic insanity that existed before America did? So you non-answer: ... I don't know Come on, dude. You can either defend your position or you can't; proposing vague related rhetorical questions doesn't count. You've made these (quite frankly offensive, and I don't offend easily) claims about Americans and then the first refutation I offer up you can't think of what to say. Admit that your claims are false and poorly thought out or defend them; making claims you can't back up is a hallmark of ignorance, and I don't think you're all that ignorant."	0
I don't remember texas having great living standards. . 	The have a much cheaper cost of living. I think they are way better off than all of the other Southern states, and I think it might be easier to live than New York and California. I am not exactly sure, though. I haven't seen people complaining about living in Texas, maybe you know something I don't.	0
So you have evidence that clearly states there is no God ?	I guess the fact that religious diversity is in existence but does not clearly state there is no God.	0
"No it does not mean that. If you don't like a lot of things about someone then you don't force yourself to like them. If there is a lot of things you don't agree with and a lot of misunderstandings then you are simply incompatible and true love could not surface anyway. That's also why i said ""petty flaws"". Many flaws would not be petty."	If you can force yourself to like someone then that means 'true love' does not exist.	0
I think that this rule is really dumb because what if there is a serious situation going on why your mom or dad cannot come. And then they try to give u a ticket that is stupid and dumb and thats why i say no.	i think that your one of those kids Mr. Halton.	0
Retarded. Please get out of here. Look at many other leaders, Winston Churchil, Abraham Lincolin, George Washington, and Techumseh were all better than him.	and look what the rich did to lincoln? incidentally whilst churchilll is the greatest war leader in history, and next to lloyd george the greatest orator, his domestic record wasnt great to say the least and he was booted after the war too. Obama has made fundamental change. talk about brave, he decided to insure 50 million poorest americans, in the start of the biggest recession in 80- years and in the middle of 2 unwinnable world wars.	0
"wtf is the point....you fuck, then you pull your cock out of her pussy and shoot all over her face? and you call that ""making love""?"	Who's calling it making love? It's called porn. I think your debate might be slightly more interesting if you were referring to what consenting adults choose to do in the real world.	0
I feel that there is no need for anyone to stay after an event is over for more than thirty minutes. If they want to celebrate they can go somewhere else. If people are there then that means the people working there will have to be, so people should just help out and go else where. Giving a ticket may be the only way to get peoples attention and have them listen.	There is a need because not all of the kids that stay are white and have caring parents. And you asy that cuz you don't know anyone so that you could stay 30after	0
"The reason I have a problem with them being exclusionary is because it contradicts their mission statement which states ""Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential."" They remind me of the <a href='http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/24/south-carolina-soup-kitchen-refuses-to-allow-atheists-to-volunteer/'>Christian-run soup kitchens that have been telling atheists that they can't volunteer there. The Sunday Assembly may not outright refuse to allow theists, but they certainly aren't going to make them feel welcome by calling it a ""godless congregation"".  If their goal truly is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"" and encourage people to ""live better, help often, and wonder more"" then excluding people just because they believe in a god is a bad move. Like I said, it creates an us vs. them mentality instead of a lets all work together to make the world a better place mentality.  If they want to exclude theists they can, but they need to change their mission statement and not pretend like they are really about helping the community as a whole."	"Ok, that makes sense. Since I haven't actually been to one, I can't say how exclusionary the vibe is. I mean, if it's just the general idea of ""atheist congregation"", but they are not actually DOING anything that excludes theists, then I would be inclined to believe it's other people being overly sensitive, but if they are actively making people feel unwelcome - well, then they are giving atheists a bad rap, which is wrong. But they could be being completely accepting, while making it clear that this is not the place to go and try to convert people."	0
that's beside the point. he main point is that attractive people get specialties. You even agreed to that. It doesn't matter that both sides have advantages, because as the question asks attractive people have advantages that unattractive people don't. Indisputable.	but the advantages of being attractive are things that rich people get. So it's untrue to say that others don't get it.	0

What if they sat at the front? Then they are in greater danger of being injured if they are in an accident, than if they sat in the back. Of course, if they sit in the back, they are still in danger, but the danger increases if they sit in the front. I should make a debate about this instead You asked for sources. And isn't this a debate about that ? I mean, the headline is 'Should elementary school students be allowed to ride in the front seat of a car' - I am now showing why I don't think so. you mean they may not be true Yes, I haven't done any research on whether it is true or not. But like I said, the top 10 hits in that google search I made all said the same - the child is safer in the back. Ask all traffic experts, they will all say the same. Bombs? and that small machine in front of the exercise bike. <a href='http://www.ehow.com/how_5539485_turn-off-airbag-ford-focus.html'>http://www.ehow.com/how_5539485_turn-off-airbag-ford-focus.html  that is how you turn off airbags.	Then they are in greater danger of being injured if they are in an accident, than if they sat in the back. Of course, if they sit in the back, they are still in danger, but the danger increases if they sit in the front. what if they hid under the chair or in front of it instead? at the front? I don't think there is any problem sitting at the front. Although there is danger, it is still okay to sit at the front  I mean, the headline is 'Should elementary school students be allowed to ride in the front seat of a car' There is a difference. this is about whether they should sit at the front. The other debate is about whether it is safer at the front or the back.  Ask all traffic experts, they will all say the same. Are you sure? that is how you turn off airbags. the only said about ford focus cars	0
