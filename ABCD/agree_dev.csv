I am not sure which part you don't like. I believe it is obvious that if everyone is the same that there won't be racism. Please let me know if you are disputing that. I think that solution would work, but I don't believe that is the solution we should use to get rid of racism. I think that interracial marriages are good and having everyone be the same would get rid of racism, so interracial marriages should be supported for that reason. I don't know how to get rid of racism. Education is a working well. But, I think the best thing for racism would be uniformity. If we have a bunch of different groups who don't want to assimilate with each other I believe we will have more racism. So, I guess I do think making everyone the same is the solution.	I am not sure which part you don't like. I believe it is obvious that if everyone is the same that there won't be racism. Please let me know if you are disputing that. I didn't dispute. I know that there won't be racism if everyone is the same - I just wanted to ask you if you thought making everyone the same is a proper solution for racism.	2
I like the idea of working with hospitals. Here we change the system so we can work with insurance companies more.  Do you have a harder time affording things by paying more in taxes?	I'm 17 so I don't pay taxes yet. But I think we get paid more, so it equals out. Minimum wage UK (over 21) £6.19($9.50) USA $7.25 (£4.72)	2
I certainly hope spontaneous self combustion isn't real. After seeing spinal tap I've been on edge behind my set. - But in all reality, knowing me, I should have no faith in such mindless ideas. That is if I hadn't already had certain experiences.	There are thousands of accounts - if not millions - detailing things from aliens to pyrokinesis.	2
See, this is why I wrote that first statement. It's incredibly illogical. You have such a corrupt sense of morality. Would you be the sort of person who would have fought in the Crusades because you felt it was God's will? I mean, you need to see it from a more neutral perspective.  Cheating on a test? That is bad for a good reason. That means he's not learning and he's using other people's work without doing the work himself. Stealing a car means he's taking something from someone else. That's unfair for the other person. Being gay has no negative. That's why it's not wrong. - I highly recommend you think a little before you say something. I mean, answer this honestly: Is your morality straight out of the Bible, or did you think of why good things are good and why bad things are bad on your own? Do you just follow the Bible, or do you actually try to find reasons why being good is being good and being bad is being bad?	"""Cheating on a test? That is bad for a good reason. That means he's not learning and he's using other people's work without doing the work himself... Being gay has no negative."" Actually, being gay has many negative consequences... 60% of male homosexuals had more than 250 lifetime sexual partners... 28% had more than 1000 lifetime sexual partners.... and 79% admitted that more than half of their sexual partners were strangers (The Institution for Sex Research; Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). ""The average AIDS victim has had 60 different sexual partners in the past twelve months... the average heterosexual male has - throughout his life - from five to nine sex partners"" (Dr. William Foege, Director of the Centers for Disease Control). ""Yvonne Zipter, a lesbian writing in Chicago's gay journal Windy City Times, in an article entitled ""The Disposable Lesbian Relationship,"" notes that the ""lasting lesbian relationship"" is a ""mythic entity"" (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). The current figure is that 70% of Americans with  AIDS are male homosexuals or bisexuals. Dr. Bernard J. Klamecki, says that 86% of homosexual males use various drugs to enhance and increase their sexual stimulation. The homosexual is also 3 times more suicidal than heterosexuals. The life expectancy for gays wihtout AIDS is 33 years shorter than hetersexuals.... etc. (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 148). The life style of gays is not a safe one.... I'm sorry, but you are wrong... ---------- And yes, I believe the Bible, so I follow the Bible. If God is real the He is the one to decide what is good and bad... not us!"	2
vedara qué? 	Is he green you bum.............................................................	2
So, you've contradicted yourself? Well done. 13 year-olds and below cannot join unless they are of a higher intelligence. Would you also suggest an IQ test?	At what point was there a contradiction? I stated that the -average- 13 year old does not possess what some of us are looking for. Stop trolling.	2
I can't watch the video, it's not available. But anyways, it's okay that he did that. I'm not sure what other way could they learn.	"You should definitely see that video before you answer.  If you can't see it in <a href='http://digitaljournal.com/article/347428'>this link or the one at the bottom of my argument, look up ""man beats daughter for twerking""."	2
Then you are disproving yourself. This would start the rise of humans.	WTF...no it wouldn't. Five times the modern level of CO2, not O2, would lead to a rise in plant life. I am quoting evolutionary history....stop the bs. I focused a whole year on biblical interpretation and Hebrew source, along with evolution and the big bang.	2
I find that they sometimes ask religious people to 'open their minds', when they never do.	I have found this also, I have also found that some will make assumptions that your a Christian just because you disagree with them and can be very judgmental which can be annoying but this obiously is not all Atheists and without em this site for one would be a lot quieter and boring	2
Have you read all of this story...? if not it's somewhat obvious it's basically a bet..	"Not at all. For something to be a bet both sides have to object to the other. God never said to Satan in anyway"" I bet you'll be wrong"" therefore it is not a bet. And if there is more of the story than what is presented, please present."	2
When the alternatives are pathological liars it's really no surprise (in reference to the second to last sentence).	mmm, yes, well, then prehaps representative democracy isnt the best option. Always a few flaws in every system.	2
"Your body is designed to want food. Breakfast is not addictive though. Saying "" Oh I want more things with sugar in!"" is not natural."	That's assuming all drugs are addictive. I won't list the ones that aren't but I'm just stating that a drug doesn't have to be different. If it causes a change in your physiology it could be considered a drug, but sugar doesn't breach that barrier, it's just a food.	2
when ever it occurs,we can see that,if we are alive. isn't it	Love it. . Nice english.	2
Sugar makes you hyper and gives you energy. It has short term and long term effects. Makes you fat. So over all it's bad though upfront it may seem good. Everything a drug normally is! Well the illegal/recreational ones anyway..!	You can make anything sound like a drug if you word it correctly. Eating breakfast can and often does cause a person to feel energized in the morning and prepare for the day.	2
I was going to select the neutral position but was not able to ;)	Which is exactly why we need one XD Oh I love smart asses	2
Thermonuclear weapons. Noone's gonna take over the world anytime soon.	Damn! I was hoping for some authentic Chinese food :)	2
"More power to them let them sue you the judge would laugh in their face. Here is how the trial would sound like. Defense lawyer ( DL ) "" So you are suing my client because you tripped down his stairs? "" Robber ( R ) "" Yes sir "". DL "" What were you doing in his house? "". R "" well sir it was a robbery and I was going down the stairs with his plasma screen TV when ..."" Judge "" What in the hell is going on? Bailiff cuff that incognizant moron, was he really suing the VICTIM?! He just admitted to committing a felony get him outta here! "".  That would be idiotic. You also have the right to kill someone that has broken into your house. If someone breaks into your house you automatically have the right to blow his brains all over the floor with your 12 gauge shotty. Oh and one more thing how do you kill someone with a license? ;) JK"	This is absolute nonsense!	2
There are so many cowards on this site. I am sure that a couple of them are actually reasonably well-known members here who have created a seperate account to up-vote their own posts so as to gain extra points plus to appear that some are in agreement with them. Pathetic. Absolutely shameful lol!	Hey, I'm going to send you a message here in a minute or two so check you mail....	2
Nicole's right, plus it kind of already is, unless we choose for it not to be. Like, my name is my name, and yours Jake, plus we have our pick, and I have links and everything else. But we don't have all that. I could name myself like 1234567 and have a picture of a question mark as my avatar, then it would be anonymous I guess.	Yeah good point, I don't see a good reason for it. But it would make things interesting.	2
What about attitudes to time and money, are they linked?	Sometimes accidentally. One has to become mature and realise one day that money is only precious here and now but time is precious forever.	2
"""I'm also convinced that if a country like America is gradually becoming more atheist it would be hard for the rest of the world not to follow suit,"" Contrary to what you may believe in, the whole world does not revolve around America."	"""World does not revolve around America""  People have been ignoring Americans for ages."	2
what if i do :O  True love comes out during the relationship. so i have to get into a relationship with as many people as possible to find out. :O what if i don't WANT to? get into a relationship thingy i mean. =\	so i have to get into a relationship with as many people as possible to find out. Just get into a relationship with people that you want to be with.  what if i don't WANT to Then don't get into a relationship. o.o  .	2
"That isn't so much of a game influenced behavioral problem as much as it's a community influenced problem. The ""bitchy-whiny child syndrome"" is a result of immature actions and speech among players. The game does not directly influence these actions."	Sorry. I should have made that a more clear joke response. I usually like to do those, but yeah I'm aware people don't turn into slobbering monsters because they see fake violence. If they did, Halloween would probably already be banned or something.	2
"No I was referring to your word use. If you presented the sentence:  ""If guys bled from their penis once a month, wouldn't they be bitching about it t"" in a tribunal, the defense would then pick apart the words you have used and turn them against you, because you haven't worded it very well. And you haven't. Your 'guys bleeding from penises once a month' thing is a parallel of a woman's period So obviously there will be comparisons involved. I don't want to be a lawyer I wouldn't be very good at it, I stutter too much :P"	You were using my words and interpreted them into something that weren't my own words :)	2
china only show off. it doesn't have much power. many countries are ahead from china...	Not true. The only reason China can't take over the world right now is because of nuclear weapons. The people of China are so brainwashed and afraid of their government that every single on of them, given a weapon, would be willing to take up arms. They actually have the strongest military force on Earth, if we dont count nukes.	2

Generally, the Spartans didn't really fight with the rest of them. Only untill it was a unified empire(?) did they, and even that I'm not 100% sure on.	well during the war with the persian empire they did fight with the others. otherwise there wouldnt have been a battle of 300.	2

You are in luck! I happen to have considerable experience as a sidekick. From 97-04 I was the Human Spatula's sidekick, Salad Tong. Admittedly, this was a bush league gig, but I did learn a few handy tricks of the trade along the way. For instance I know 8 tips for time-traveling to the past with out creating an anomaly in the present. Following HS' rather unfortunate...accident...I served as the Stallion's sidekick, Hung Long. Although this job required a very painful ethnicity reassignment surgery, I was happy to do so in order to serve such a noble and respectable hero, and along the way I was credited with co-saving the Earth (except for Cleveland) no less than 4 times! Those were the days...it is unfortunate that he suffered such an untimely demise. After returning to my original ethnicity, I rode shotgun with..the Shotgun! While his rather intense form of vigilantism was a bit unsettling at first, I quickly adapted to the job and have become quite proficient at shooting a thug's gonads off from any angle and range.  Sadly, last Thursday he accidentally fell from a 20 story building after responding to an emergency call that appears to have come from my communicator badge....anywho... when do I start?	Well good lord! You certainly do sound qualified.. .	2
Your urine contains nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, sodium and chloride ions along with trace elements and amino acids, grass and plants benefit from your peeing on them, so don't worry about bullying them, even taking a dump on them supplies valuable fertiliser. Go and fill your garden with all your bodily waste, it'll thank you for it.	And while you're at it, give it some carbon dioxide!	2
Nobody should stand in the way of a persons right to be happy, even though I'm happily married myself, I'm not going to stay in a loveless or abusive marriage if it ever turns out that way I think you make a very good point. It is senseless to rigidly adhere to a principal when it results in the mutual detriment of all of those involved.	To be honest I'd rather see marriage abolished than divorce disallowed.	2
"I don't know much about how online degrees actually work. But theoretically speaking, if online students have to pass the same tests and demonstrate they are as capable and efficient as a student who attended a physical medical school, I wouldn't see that as a problem. With so many countries in shortage of doctors and nurses, how can I criticise offering people another route to fulfilling that shortage? I do think that no matter how they got their degree, they should work through a certain internship period before ""graduating"" as full medical personnel, to ensure they have adequate practical experience."	"I do think that no matter how they got their degree, they should work through a certain internship period before ""graduating"" as full medical personnel, to ensure they have adequate practical experience They do, every person getting into the medical field via an online course must have hands on practice and pass hands on physcal tests."	2
Hold on, I genuinely thought it was a shopping trolley.	Erm, I don't know of any shopping trolleys big enough to kill 5 children. I just got the semantics from wikipedia, so meh.	2
Yes. There are two rational arguments for this possibility. 1) It is possible that everything exists, .'. every eventuality will come to pass, including flying pigs and spaghetti monsters. 2) Deities, should they exist, are shown to crave power and create cults to worship them. I am sure cultless deities would adopt a man made cult in no time. Haha cultless, cutlass... no, not really.	Just expand #1. 1) It is possible given an infinite amount of time, then an infinite amount of things would exist. (Premise) 2) The Flying Spaghetti monster is timeless (Premise) 3) If an infinite amount of things exist, then everything would eventually be encompassed in that infinity. (From 1) 4) The Flying Spaghetti Monster would therefore exist then. (From 1 and 3) 5) The flying Spaghetti Monster Exists. (From 2 and 4)	2
Or I could say that this dust is not all that became of the person. I know a number of people who are considered dead who are more inspiring than most who are considered alive. So to you extending yourself best boundaries is just influencing people after you die?  Perhaps from moment to moment such changes occur and it's only through our failure to ascribe significance to these changes that we don't see a need to create a new label for each stage of everything that changes. What? No. You 'ascribe significance' to the change in being a burger to being shit. We can call it digestion. If something fundamentally changes then it is no longer what it was to begin with.  It's a chewed up, partially digested, shat out burger,that would be tasty to flies, and some dogs You're seriously arguing that my shit is still a burger? Believe in evolution (its sad I even have to ask this but it is necessary on this site :/ )? Is it correct for me to call you a star fish? Do you consider yourself both a starfish and a human? I suppose if a change doesn't negate the original definition I imagine you're also a chimpanzee, bacteria etc etc. Must be confusing for you. Every bit of the person remains albeit in changing form, just like your stinky burger shit. The atoms are the same. It is still a different thing. Graphite and diamond are both made of carbon atoms but they are very different things.  Extra credit points if you correctly guess which usage definition of literal I was thinking of when I chose that word :) The one that doesn't appear in the dictionary. Don't feel bad. Its a common mistake. See link below.	So to you extending yourself best boundaries is just influencing people after you die? I see myself literally continuing to develop after the event called death  If something fundamentally changes then it is no longer what it was to begin with.  Nothing ever is what is was to begin with You're seriously arguing that my shit is still a burger? Just as seriously as your aim to ridicule Believe in evolution (its sad I even have to ask this but it is necessary on this site :/ )? Is it correct for me to call you a star fish? I most certainly do, and if I evolved from a starfish, I think you could quite correctly call me an evolved starfish. Do you consider yourself both a starfish and a human? Maybe if I ate a starfish, I would :)  I suppose if a change doesn't negate the original definition I imagine you're also a chimpanzee, bacteria etc etc. Must be confusing for you. Nah, I can think in a non-absolutist manner without much trouble. The atoms are the same. It is still a different thing. Graphite and diamond are both made of carbon atoms but they are very different things.  Two diamonds are different things, and unless you can prove something doesn't change in any possibly significant way from moment to moment, your logic would have us inventing new terms at a unreasonably fast pace. The one that doesn't appear in the dictionary. Don't feel bad. Its a common mistake. See link below. Sorry, no extra credit points for you.

If they are laying on the ground, with blood gushing out of them, but dying slowly, you know that you couldn't make it to a hospital before they suffered to death and you lack the abilities to help them, then yes I would think so.

I wouldn't go for the death penalty just because of the crime, I'd go with it on the likelihood it was to happen again. If he can be rehabilitated, then there's no reason for the death penalty, but as it appears he can't. After getting out of Jail, he went and did a crime worse than the original, and as I read the article it seemed he wasn't guilty at all. Guilty in the emotional sense. There's no hope for guys like that, and wasting tax dollars to house and feed him isn't going to do anyone any good.	He brutally murdered the mother stabbing her multiple times in the head.	2
whatever it is we all are humans and our likes are different we are normal and some are not this dosent mean that we must suppress them we have to give them equal rights	"i agree that we should support them, but to say they're not normal is kind of contradicting the point that they should be supported in the ""equal rights"" thing. a human is a human, regardless of their sexual orientation. and who's to say what's normal? normalcy isn't real. being normal would mean we were all the same, and that's not the case. you know?"	2
Yep!  	So.... for infinity God just sat around with nothing to do and then one day he was all like... Hey! Maybe I'll create a universe and stuff with people and animals and light and dark and evil and stuff!	2
He was fiscally liberal and socially conservative. From what you've said, you're not very socially liberal. Might like to add that disagreeing with you doesn't make someone incorrect.	Fiscally liberal = right-wing (which I am the opposite of in many respects) I personally don't view hating drugs as being socially conservative and in every other respect I am socially liberal.	2

Disclaimer: I have zero formal education on the topic. However, I have an opinion, just like everyone else ;) Fiat money has created a disposable society. Your iPhone is disposable. It is not cost effective to fix it and you'll be lusting over the new iPhone a few months after buying one. With a commodity based standard, we probably wouldn't able to afford to change standards as quickly as we do. For example, moving from vinyl to tape to CDs to DVDs, etc. It just wouldn't be cost effective. With a commodity based standard, things should slow down. People would be able to keep a job for decades, instead of years. This means that people would be able to retire from one company. When (if) I retire, I will be collecting a little from every company I've ever worked for. On the down side, economic down turns would last longer and the gap between rich and poor could widen even more. But I'm just talking out my ass because my mouth knows better ;)	I don't get the joke.	2
Then why did you pick the side that said it was a racially motivated attack?	I just picked a side so I could comment. .	2
How did you get Yugoslavia's? That's one that I couldn't find. You are lucky.	Thanks. I got Yugoslavia's flag from the New Brunswick flag shoppe. I special ordered it. I think you might be able to find one on ebay, as you probably don't have the NBFS where you live :)	2
Some women are better teachers than some men, some men are better teachers than some women. Your gender doesn't give us any information what your qualifications have.	Couldn't have said it better my self ( well I could, but no need to now!)	2
If you obey God then why are you trying to twist the rules because that is what your doing.	DAMNIT SROM. Yes, you are COMPLETELY right, I think. I can't believe I am saying this, but I COMPLETELY agree with you. To modify a religion is to invent your own. The words of a god twisted and CHANGED is inventing a god. It is BLASPHEMY, even if neither gods actually exist. However, to change the words of a holy book to suit your agenda is NOT worshiping the same god. Srom, you are RIGHT this time. Ismaila CANNOT call herself a Christian yet spit at the Holy Book and spit at Jesus, who she claims to obey.	2
Will the Filipinos being affected if the divorce bill would be submitted? let us presume that we would support the divorce bill but, would it change the uniqueness of the Philippines? let us presume that it would, of course it would because we are unique because we mark our words and we keep our promises and vows to God.	I agree. As I have said, Filipinos are unique. Divorce is not part of our uniqueness though. It will greatly affect the lives of Filipinos and also the economy.	2
No. There is no reason to.	I agree. .	2
That's what I am saying he said. Jesus said there is no need to cut off your dick, that's why they followed him.	Nope, incorrect. That wasnt even on his radar never came up. The Jews had to at a young age because that was their culture, these are the original converts I talked about.	2
No. I do not have faith in the prophecies of the Bible. I do understand that according to the Bible, it should have happened a heck of a long time ago. I do know that numerous people have predicted it countless times, and yet here we all are, devout Christians right alongside us.	Tell me more. .	2

I think as a whole the decisions made by the masses are better than those made as an individual. When you have a diverse group of people you get opinions that tend to differ from your own. While you may think you're always right, the fact is that there are many smart people out there whose opinions could help you make a better decision. That's the beauty of this site. I get to hear everyone else's opinions on some very important and controversial topics and then formulate my own perspective.	EVERYONE DOES THINK THAT THEY ARE RIGHT.. AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN A GROUP, THEY TEND TO INSIST THEIR VIEW.. AND WITH THAT, WHAT WOULD YOU CAME UP WITH?... IT'S BETTER TO CARRY IT SINGLEHANDEDLY THEN REVISE IF NEEDED BY CHECKING OTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME SORT...	2

How exactly? Wouldn't it benefit poorer countries the most? They said it hurts the poor in the poor country and hurts everyone expect the rich in the rich nation.	Who's they?

"I'm supporting you because i can help. If you look at my argument and facts there is a lot to the issue it's like an onion it has multiple layers to it. I'm a Realtor and mortgage broker so I know the history well and why we are where we are. 1993 was huge for bankers when Clinton signed that bill it added extra lending liquidity and created ""Fiat Money"" or money out of thin air because it allowed bankers to extend what they call their fractional reserve lending. For every $1 i now can lend $30 dollars. It's scary. But when they did this is helped loosen banks requirements and loans where being handed out like candy on a street. I can keep going on but basically when banks make loans to people like you and me they make money the government makes money while you and I get stuck with the bill. I can lecture on this for 2 hours if given the chance. But that is one layer to the onion that I was talking about."	"Wow! Glad to see that someone else recognizes the actualities and implications of a fiat currency. (All deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of the United States.) FDIC insurance! Fractional Reserve lending. Again I am impressed! How about this: Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar?

That was the same basic thinking for my history class. You can often times avoid biases by stating the events that led to the historical characters decision making. A good example of my teachers doing this well was their description of the build-up to the american revolution, that painted both sides with logical motives as well as occasional blunders.	Right. Our are told to teach unbiased things. Both perspective or all perspectives must be told and no teacher can teach one in favor for another.	2

Yes, but eveyone has their own opinion about everything. That puts me in the situation of WTF should I do if someone just decides to go ape shit and delete all sorts of stuff? Not that they would, but I would have to revamp the entire reporting system to allow for roll back / roll foward capabilties. This just isn't possible right now.	Sure, but that's why you'd give modship to people YOU trust, Andy (as I've said, you'd be the deciding factor in, not only whether or not it gets implemented, but who gets said modships). I can't imagine in a million years Joe, Hellno, Prayerfails ever going batshit crazy like that.	2
I was hatin rap, until I heard that. 	Which song, Intangible? I personally love Versace and Bugatti. I want a Bugatti Veyron.	2
yes you are right, this host just not know history at all. but Muslims would probably tell u different in their mosque.	You are saying that Joe doesn't know anything? This is just one of his joke debates. I'm sure that he has an IQ of at leat 42.	2
"I'm not here to make friends ""Joe""...sorry...it's just not an issue with me. How my so-called ""friends"" one has on here does not seem to correlate to whether or not their positions are true or not."	Truth is such a strong word. Positions are like the shifting sands of the Sahara forest, which my great, great uncle (the greatest lumber jack that ever lived) used to work in.	2
Well, I can't. You didn't provide a link. Personally, I moved on from Mussorgsky to Stravinsky at age 16 and never looked back. I listened to the Rite of Spring every night while falling to sleep for a year. I even have the two piano performance of it, and can recreate the orchestration in my head.	You probably ought to post these in CD's music box. <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/The_Music_Box'>http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       The_Music_Box 	2

"Unfortunately the pain still exists for a lot of people who feel like they are still oppressed by white people. The majority of African Americans still live in poverty and have worse educational system, health care, and career opportunities than do most white Americans. I don't think necessarily that ""reparations"" should be paid, but I do think that we need to do more to help African Americans help themselves out of the poverty cycle."	"The only trouble is that u know a lot of white people live in povetry too.  But they don't have an old big ""discrimination"" thing to blame this on.  We should take the facts straight. People are NOT equal. We can't have equal opportunities for everyone. Cos' we are not equal when we get birth. A child of some junkies won't ever have equal opportunities with a child of two professors just because he is genetically dumber. He won't have the same intellectual and cultural level etc. I think that nowadays when we have tons of opportunities for a person that really wants to fight his\her way from poverty. If a person is stubborn and strong enough - he\she will make it. And if not - well than they deserve povetry. The government should be concerned about those who can't fight by their own: mentally and physically challenged people, old people, children.  But it is ridiculous when a grown up man is whining smth like ""Oh nobody gave me a chance so i ended up as a bum"" Come on u're a man, u have two hands and a working brain - go work and fight for your rights"	2
"What's interesting though is that the British Crown still considered them British citizens. Thats why they viewed conscription of American sailors during the Napoleonic wars as legal. They didn't view us as ""Americans"" until we kicked their ass in the War of 1812, which many consider still a part of the war for independence."	Yeah the Brits where some sour losers that's for sure. We had to kick there ass twice for them to finally get the memo.	2
You cant have creativity without intelligence. But you can be intelligent without being creative.	I agree that you can't have creativity without intelligence. I would say you also can't have intelligence without creativity.  Intelligence:  a (1) : the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations : reason; also : the skilled use of reason  (2) : the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (as tests)	2
Well, this wasn't really about the cat but about people creeping on your profile page, LOL! Here's a song about it that I bet you can appreciate since it features MJ! ;)	I like that song now it will be stuck in my head for awhile.	2
Everyone should stop war, but America is by far the worse when it comes to military spending.	Military spending isn't really a fair comparison of the countries. North Korea couldn't spend nearly as much as the US spends. The US spends 22 times as much on military than North Korea's entire GDP. The US is bore aggressive as well, but I suspect that's because they can be. If North Korea was capable of doing what the US does, it would.	2
Whar's wrong with trolololo????? ?????????????????	He's a questionably gay Russian probably on speed all the time that can sing for 24 hours straight a very repetitive song and who hasn't been seen since the sixties when he flew away on a dinosaur and invented breast implants while living under the sea in the lost city of Atlantis.  See, even gay men love titties, or some of them any ways, ta tas are awesome.	2
LOL! I've never even started to write a message to you??? I may have just been writing a message to someone else or it was a glitch? You're not one of the people I'm stalking.	Yeah, that's what I guessed too, but creepy at the time.      	2
In situations where a person is violating someone else's right to their body, I think they forfeit their own. People have to be able to defend themselves, and sometimes that means killing someone, even if the offender didn't intend to kill their victim.  Beyond that, I would answer no. Killing a person doesn't alleviate any of the suffering or damage they caused in the past.	Beyond that, I would answer no. Killing a person doesn't alleviate any of the suffering or damage they caused in the past. What about potential for suffering and damage in the future? I know that prosecuting based on future crimes is silly, but at the point someone is already facing life in the system for absolutely horrendous, inhuman crimes, why not? I would just hate to end up in prison for tax fraud or something and end up with a mass-murdering child rapist for a cellmate. And I would hate to be a prison guard having to handle someone who is beyond redemption, shows no remorse for their crimes, and has nothing to lose because they are already facing life imprisonment. If we dont have that one final say in the matter, the death penalty, what's to stop a killer from killing after he's been convicted and sentenced to the fullest extent of the law? We could put them in solitary confinement for life, never let anyone close enough to get hurt, but that seems to me to be more a cruel and unusual punishment than death.  And I think for the families of the victims, knowing that some kind of substantial justice was dealt does bring peace of mind. At least, it's better than dragging the grieving families back to court every year to listen to the criminal appeal to the judge on why he should be let out early for good behavior.	2
"I don't see the point in making one in the first place. Do they expect people to beg for them to stay?  ""I'm leaving. Goodbye."" ""Don't leave!"" ""Ah, shucks! Alright... I'll stay."" ""That was too easy, get the fuck outta here!"""	Meh... instead I say: adios muchacho! 	2

I've read the entire fucking bible and for your information, reading the bible is what turned me agnostic, not that i was very religious beforehand llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll	After reading most of the posts here you really simplified it. Thanks. :l	2
"Which is why I am so opposed to the death penalty. I can't remember when, very recently, it was found that 1:4 people executed were subsequently found innocent. I mean imagine that someone has killed your wife or daughter, you're devestated, and then you're accused of doing it. How horrible that must be. And then you're told that you are going to be killed because of it. You're waiting on death row and they tell you "" your time is up."" You plead with them trying to tell them "" But I didn't do it, please, don't do this..."" But it's too late, you realise your fate. You're lying on the table or being placed in the chair and you know, that your life will end, certainly. You think "" but surely this can't be, it must be some sick joke, or they will realise.."" but nope, they do it. They inject you or electrocute you, and you die in physical and mental agony. I mean wtf?! What sort of person would advocate such a thing?"	Actually they kill people on the death row by injecting stuff into your blood stream the shuts down your body. You don't feel any real pain, just mental if your innocent, or guilty.	2
The government has no right to promote any sort of religion, they should be allowed to pray as long as it is on their own merits, what I'm arguing against is government mandated christian prayer, payed for with my tax money.	Ahh. Well, I understand your sentiment. I agree with you on that accord. I was under the assumption that you were arguing for the absolute restriction of religious prayer in public places or government owned property. Forgive me for the misunderstanding.	2
Dude... you're sick.	What he is gay so he might rape you........................	2
About a year ago I had a boss that was a complete bitch. Everyone hated her and gave her push back about everything. I finally realized that wasn't doing me any good so I just started agreeing with her on everything while not really changing my own behaviors... She stopped giving me any trouble at all even though my actions didn't really change... only my words did. I never had any other problems with her and I still did things the way I wanted to. I didn't really get ahead but it improved my time at work greatly just by saying some words that didn't cost me a dime.	"That is another scenario in which ""kissing ass"" can be advantageous...not so much getting ahead as not being a target. I've been in almost the exact same situation. Sometimes being a nice person has unforseen advantages.  Off topic: Please understand that I only ask this because there are a few nuances of the site I still don't understand: did you ban me from the debate where I was (my words) ""being a bitch to you""? Or did you erase the debate (if so, you don't have to explain if you don't wish)? Or a glitch? Because I cannot see anything related to it, and I'm curious. If you did ban, no hard feelings. But it seems to have totally disappeared and I wasn't thinking banning had that quality (never been banned that I know of)?"	2
This person has asked a valid question and made a reasonable statement, Who the hell downvoted this and why?

I am ignorant. Please tell if you can by what you mean by third class? :) I think i understand you but i am not sure.	"In murder, in burns, in theft and many other crimes there are scales of measuring the severity of them, most commonly (although in theft there are four) there are three classes of the crime. Rape is merely any form, whatsoever, of sexually connoted assault. In the first class division is the type of rape whereby permanent scars and/or broken bones are left for the victim to deal with, any and all paedophilic rape (including something as simple as a forced kiss to an under 18 year old) falls under this category. In the second class category is the type of rape whereby any severe bruising or temporary effects are left/seen on the victim. It also depends on whether or not there was any verbal threat involved. If the person,a t any point in the rape, said something along the lines of ""I will kill you"" or ""I will break you"" or something that is a threat of the actions of a first class rape, they could, depending how good or bad the lawyers representing the defendant and victim are, could get them done for first class rape instead. Essentially second class rape is simply brutal sex where there didn't appear to be any consent from the other party. Third class rape is any sexual act done onto a non-minor that isn't anything past second base but still is totally and utterly without the victim's consent."	2
I don't want it banned in government buildings, but it shouldn't be part of official business. If they want to pray at work, they can do so durning lunch or breaks. The same goes for students at school. Prayer has no business being included in the curriculum. The fact that adherents of all faiths are given equal opportunity to waste time and money doesn't make it any better. I'd be equally opposed to a person exercising their right to freedom of expression by standing up and talking about their favourite sports team for two minutes every morning...and allowing other people to talk about a different sports team, or suggesting they leave until someone else is finished doing so if they don't want to listen to it, doesn't make it ok.	It's reasonable enough for it not to be part of official business, I'll grant. But confining it to lunchtime or their breaks seems overly restrictive; your own example, discussing sports (or anything else not related to work or study, for that matter) is not confined to lunchtime or breaks, generally speaking. It's one thing if the individual(s) talking or praying are neglecting their work or studies notably to do so and/or overtly disrupting the ability of others to perform their work or studies, but there is really no harm in saying a quick prayer just before a key meeting, before a final exam, or something to that effect. And in most work and school environments, that should be fine; employees have non work related conversations among themselves, as do students- even during work related tasks and school assignments. Any time that it should be acceptable to talk about, say, sports , it should be equally acceptable to pray. But again, you're right that such should not be part of official business during a meeting, and during a meeting in general is not an appropriate time for this, official business or not.	2
No, the citizens do. Says who? If the citizens decided what was reasonable to ensure stability then sht would get chaotic Right. And I think it can be argued that the policy has brought way more harm than good to the system, therefore it is unreasonable Then argue it don't just try and state it. So you're arguing there's enough inherently wrong about having a child to warrant death? I find that ridiculous. No you are way off. :/ This should not be the case. One should not have to leave their country simply because they want a family.  Well it is the case. And what i stated is a solution to the problem. The problem being the law.	Says who? If the citizens decided what was reasonable to ensure stability then sht would get chaotic Not really. I think a democracy would be reasonable. At least more reasonable than their current government. No you are way off. :/ How so? Well it is the case. And what i stated is a solution to the problem. The problem being the law. I like my solution better. Get rid of the law.	2
Assuming it actually God who was telling me to do so, then yes I would, though I don't think He would. How would you determine whether or not it was actually God telling you to kill yourself? How does any nut job (such as Abraham) determine whether or not it's actually God telling him or her to do or not do anything?	Abraham said, after he was told to sacrifice his son, that he knew God would provide a sacrifice for him. He was told by God through some sort of means in actual language: God spoke directly to Abraham. The only thing we can take it on is faith that God is just and truthful, and was actually speaking to us, which is to say that we take it on faith that we are not insane. In practicality, I would probably go to a doctor and a pastor first, then, if the messages continued, in a very obvious and profound fashion, then I would.	2
Ah, but I've at least tried. You have yet to even provide a source for your claim. Until such a time, I am under no obligations to give in to your petty demands.	You had one argument in the whole debate that appeared like you were trying. And, that one was full of blunders. So, big deal trying.	2
It sounds like you agree with me that the other guy was wrong about Satan. Sorry about not knowing that Satan doesn't punish people. Apparently he doesn't do anything and yet Christians blame him for it. Show me. I don't remember actually changing my stance on that. I asked you if the rules were made by God. If God chooses who goes to Hell, and if Satan punishes people. You said no, no, and no. How can I clear up my position if you disregard what I say?	Pretty sure I said 'according to Christians'. I'm not Christian. Therefore it is not my belief.	2
Thats why i said it, i can only judge so much from what people type. I didnt doubt but i can;t 100% sure of anything.

Question everything :3 ...............................................................................................	2
Did no one respond to them years ago?  	Not really because I was a baby who wasn't potty trained.	2
The cells work together. By your logic the father cells just start the egg off and then quit when the baby grows with both of the parents cells and even when the baby is born both the fathers and mothers cells ate still working. So that story doesnt really apply. Unless I am misunderstanding you friend.	I don't mean it's null like it quits, I mean it's null like when you're doing an equation and you have a 1 on the top and a 1 on the bottom. 1/1 equals 1. So there's no need to count them, then comes the rest of the work, the mother's carrying the baby, practically feeding the baby, giving it oxygen, all of this for nine months. Yet this would continue all day if we try to argue on opinion, I have a question that I believe should clear things all up, yet I won't mind continuing if I'm wrong. They can not split the baby up, one of their decisions has to reign supreme. As unbiased as I can ask, Who's decision should the doctor go with, the mother's or the father's?	2
"H2O2. ""Due to its oxidizing properties, hydrogen peroxide is often used as a bleach or cleaning agent"""	Correct, many woman use it as a type of bleaching agent for blood stains due to that property. In fact it works very well. However, commercialized bleach is a chlorine compound not a water and oxygen compound. There is a difference. Especially, due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide is a medicinal agent that your body produces to fight off infections and sickness already. Bleach merely poisons you.	2
I'd say it's time for a serious breakfast. No matter how insane or obsessive this debate may seem. ;) But I would call the Nannerpus a serious breakfast. Anyone who dives into a huge stack of pancakes with a puppet banana on top is a serious breakfast eater. You need preparation for something like that. Anyone can eat a pancake, a couple of eggs, and a few sausages. Who are we? Farmers? No. Well, at least I don't think we are... We want a serious breakfast, for serious breakfast eaters. Adventurous breakfast eaters that aren't afraid to eat a banana with eyes on their pancakes. I'd go for the Nannerpus. I'm a serious breakfast eater.

I'm not hairy at all....but I am a feminist, albeit not a militant one...but when I see crap like that float out of your brain and onto a virtual piece of paper I could scream. How dare you classify women in that manner you Neanderthal nitwit.	I think you're taking this all too seriously.	2

That's actually why he called himself General Mosquito, because everyone fears malaria over there. There were like three General Bin Laden's, a General Rambo, and one dude was called General Butt-Naked... because he liked to fight naked or something lol.	Huh! Well, they sound like a fun bunch.	2

I really don't see why they shouldn't be allowed I mean apart from them being the same sex what's the difference?	Thank you! It's the simplest and most definite argument on this whole debate I bet. It needs no more explanation, they are the exact same except their sexual preference.	2
That was the most rational argument on the issue of religon i have ever seen. I wish more people would listen to you.	Thanks. I wish more people would listen to me too but I have a feeling half of them don't even finish reading what I post.	2
Yeah, Srom that was a little harsh. Next time buffer what you say.	Wait... but you said that to me, not Srom.... Are you high on eucalyptus?	2

"It does give historians a sense of ancient writing styles and give them a sense of the mindsets of different people from back then. I don't see how one writing is more ""accurate"" than another if its just writings. It just shows us how people thought. It gives us a sense of what people believed back then."	Of what people believed in sure thats the bible. But then again historians wrote the same things so the bible isnt a secret exclusive inside look at their beliefs. And we were talking about how people lived at the time, not only what they believed but their culture, daily lives, agriculture, relations, conflicts, ect. Historians jobs were to write down factual unbiased report-like accounts of their times which are far more trustworthy than a religious book that doesnt seek to be accurate or give a report of daily life but to propogate its belief set.	2
What about people like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, yes I know Alex is Lib but he's still a conservative Christian extremist? Rush runs the modern day Republican party, yes he does, maybe not by recognition but by default he does, what are your thoughts on people like him and the others I listed?	I think this video is actually really cool. A lot of times all you ever see in the news is the seemingly outrageous stuff that controversial people say. But given a broader and deeper context, it's much harder to criminalize a person for a remark.	2
Glad you agree. .	Thanks. :) .	2
Bad boy, bad boy... Wocka ya gonna do when they come for you? LOL!	What youtube idiot, thought that Bob Marley wrote that song? {laughs}	2
No, they should not be treated as a valid point of view, but instead of resorting to insults and name calling a much more constructive thing to do would be to try to explain to them the flaws in their logic in a friendly way. People are much more receptive to a friendly explanation than a personal insult. If you try to explain things nicely, the recipient will often view it as you trying to be helpful. On the flip-side, if you insult them they are going to view it as you trying to be harmful. Which of those two approaches do you think is more likely to get through to them?	"Neither. Only time and knowledge perceived as coming from self can open a closed mind. When I make fun bigotry it is as effective to the individual as when I or you explain it rationally, that is to say it is not. What treating it as valid, whether you believe it to be valid or not, does to is lend unearned authority to the opinion in question.  If someone were to ask me the question posted as in the title without this particular text to follow, I'd be more than happy to explain it similar to how it was explained prior to that last paragraph.  However, when someone assumes ""moral"" superiority in such a manner that it is obvious they've no intention of actually asking a question and only wish to preach, I reserve the right to make fun of them. I will stop making fun of anti-gay sentiment framed from a moral superior soap box on the day anti-gay individuals cease their relentless pursuit of discrimination. As it stands, asking whether this person is a small child is hardly equivalent to actively protesting the rights in real life of tens or hundreds of thousands of people."	2
(I MEAN A EVEN BATTLE LIKE 1000 VS 100) Just how is 1000 Vs 100 an even battle? And are any gay rainbow ponies involved?	no. I do not. OK? No ponies. Alright? anyways what up? anything going on?	2
Could you elaborate?	You are not very bright, huh? It's simple cause and effect. When everyone starts eating their species then eventually they would all go extinct. There can be no problems to solve if there are not any creatures to experience the problems.	2
Nobody should stand in the way of a persons right to be happy, even though I'm happily married myself, I'm not going to stay in a loveless or abusive marriage if it ever turns out that way, I'd prefer that my children know that you need to be happy.	Nobody should stand in the way of a persons right to be happy, even though I'm happily married myself, I'm not going to stay in a loveless or abusive marriage if it ever turns out that way I think you make a very good point. It is senseless to rigidly adhere to a principal when it results in the mutual detriment of all of those involved.	2
I don't always buy circular pizza, but when do, I cut my slices into triangles.	What's wrong with you people ;)	2
I love your argument. As asinine as I think certain beliefs in this world are, I always try my best, as a human being, to be tolerant and accepting of however any other fellow human being decides to come to terms with their existence on this earth. People want answers to EVERYTHING and when they don't have the answer to such a big question (WHY?), they may come up with some seemingly crazy ideas. But who are any of us to judge? <br />And I just got way too deep on the Tom Cruise debate ...	"Wow, as I read your argument I was thinking ""kori is getting way too deep for a Tom Cruise debate"" and then I read your last sentence. BAM! I can eat planets!"	2
"There's an actual major at some schools called ""women's studies,"" where they study politics, society, media, and history from women's perspectives. So some people might consider it inappropriate for a guy to major in this."	I dont see why people would say it is innapropriate. Maybe somebody wants to learn about the history and viewpoints of women. I think it is fine.	2

The American dream is to move higher up in social class. Not move down. The wealthy pay 52% of Americas taxes.	That's true. So, what percentage of the wealth of the country is owned by the people who pay for 52% of the taxes?	2
However, if Obama is disliked at the moment a successful war could seriously boost his popularity and even leave him with a good legacy. I have a feeling that is all he needs to care about at the moment, since he cannot get re-elected he just wants to make sure he's remembered in a good light.	I doubt that will work, considering he promised to withdraw all troops from Iraq and Afghanistan during his first term and they are still over there. So instead of ending a war, he's just adding another one.	2
How about this one? ;) <a href='http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/175/9/7/Wounded_by_Lessprit.jpg'>http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/175/9/7/Wounded byLessprit.jpg	That is sick!	2
The pain does still exist and, in some way, reparations are already being made. Only through education can true remedy be made and affirmative action is already being used to access to education. The question may be, does that go far enough?	Arguments in favour: 1. Yes because, in the past they did terrible work and this didn’t improve the family. The family could still have bad memories from a generation that in their family there was slavery and that there was work which wasn’t fair. The family’s want to forget those memories by getting money.  2. Yes because if their family didn’t inherit some money of their family they would/can be poor too (because of the generation that their family way more back was poor and because of that they didn’t inherit some money). Inherit means ‘’erfen’’.  3. Maybe some people got illness in their genes from earlier family. This can be dangerous for them because of that they are poor they can’t pay medicines and the hospital so much more of the will die. And I think the government doesn’t want to sit with dead bodies because they didn’t get money. If they survive the illness would go much further into the family and the family also would be bigger so much more people will get this illness..  Arguments Against: 1. The people/family are already dead so why should we pay the family for the dead people. 2. Maybe they won’t use the money for good things like food, medicines. They could also use it for drugs and alcohol. It would be weird if we would give them money for that. 3. The Netherlands is also in the crisis so we can’t give them too much money for this. We need it more as they do. 4. Maybe they said they were family of the dead family (while they weren’t) and we give them money. Then it wouldn’t be not fair to give them this because we know that some people earn it more as they do. We are not going to give them just for free money.  5. The government disagreed some people to give money so why would we give them money? If we would do that everybody wants money. This would be not handy for the Netherlands.  Conclusion: I got to an conclusion that I am against it because the arguments of against make much more sense than the arguments in favour because there are much more reasons to be against than in favour. I also think this because we could use it much more for useful things. So my conclusion is: It is not a good idea to give the family’s money because of the arguments I gave in Arguments Against. They make much more sense than the arguments favour because then we are only thinking about the family.	2
"The question was regarding the capacity for judgment of groups vs individuals - which I read as the ability to make smart, humane choices. Not to simply perform work of some kind.  That reminds me of another debate elsewhere, in which offshore outsourcing was praised for it's salutary effect on an abstract entity known as, ""the economy."" My question, then as now, is: what about the human cost? The Nazis were infamous for their ""efficiency."""	Exactly, I'm saying the group will ultimately make the better decision, based on swam intelligence, which, incidiently, dosent involve individuals being very intelligent. Hmm, yes, we're really not sure how to define 'the economy', but no, the nazi's wern't efficient. A revision of the Nazi heirarchy by, I'm not absolutely sure, but it may have been Rommel, but he may have been dead then, but yeah, it was revised, in 1944 increased productivity by some 30%, which really gives an indication of the waste within nazi ranks. Of course, by that time, it was already too late.	2
What exactly is your point ?	I don't think it's necessarily disrespectful. As best as I can tell, Martin Luther King was a firm believer in free and unrestricted speech. However he was also practically a socialist. So it was disingenuous for Beck to align himself with King.	2
"I came across a debate at one point where you seemed upset at someone for putting words in your mouth, for ignoring you when you tried to point out that you don't believe in the Bible. Its understandable to be upset when someone misrepresents what you are saying. Now stop being a hypocrite.  Every atheist on this site has told you we don't ""believe the universe came from nothing."" We have either told you that we don't know where it came from, or pointed out mathematically valid possiblities to describe it, or have pointed out that if God can exist uncreated, why can't the universe. Several different approaches, but all with the same result. WHAT YOU SAY ATHEISTS BELIEVE IN IS NOT WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.  Pre-existence and blablabla - those are just excuses you make up, to hide the fact, that your beliefs are just as crazy as mine. These ""excuses"" include hypothesis and theories created over the course of decades of thurough research by some of the most intelligent people who have ever walked the planet using some of the most sophisticated technology yet invented. And YOU are arogant enough to say it can't be true, just because you don't get it?!?"	I get it - but as soon as I can't explain my faith, you demand proof and all kinds of stuff. But when I demand proof from you - it suddenly don't matter. I'm not trying to prove any religion or none religion wrong here - I'm just trying to say, that atheism is just as magical as other religions.	2
Sounds....... kinky?	Um... maybe.  Still they went deep into the toilet so I didn't hear a thing ... better not to I suppose unless you like to eat with sex(y?) scenery going on in the next room ...	2
"I absolutely love everything from Pink Floyd.  The wall ,Animals,The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn,ummagumma,Meddle,The final cut,Obscured by Clouds,a saucerful of secrets,Relics,Pulse,echoes,and etc. I can say the same about some other great Artists and their albums. But the list is huge. Really i just love any good music.  I find that todays music industry has it easy.  Not much REAL talent is required these days. Anyone can produce a no1 hit, if their willing to sell themselves to the ""machine""  Now go back to the birth days of Pink Floyd , Queen etc, thats where you will find real talent."	Is this the real life; is this just a fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.	2

"The only trouble is that u know a lot of white people live in povetry too.  But they don't have an old big ""discrimination"" thing to blame this on.  We should take the facts straight. People are NOT equal. We can't have equal opportunities for everyone. Cos' we are not equal when we get birth. A child of some junkies won't ever have equal opportunities with a child of two professors just because he is genetically dumber. He won't have the same intellectual and cultural level etc. I think that nowadays when we have tons of opportunities for a person that really wants to fight his\her way from poverty. If a person is stubborn and strong enough - he\she will make it. And if not - well than they deserve povetry. The government should be concerned about those who can't fight by their own: mentally and physically challenged people, old people, children.  But it is ridiculous when a grown up man is whining smth like ""Oh nobody gave me a chance so i ended up as a bum"" Come on u're a man, u have two hands and a working brain - go work and fight for your rights"	I agree that people point the finger at discrimination and other scapegoats quite often. It just makes people feel better to transfer the responsibility to other people or concepts. It might make them feel better for the time being, but they still continue to remain in the same miserable situation.  I also agree that the government should (and they are) help those who cannot make decisions on their own. I also think people who are unfortunately born into poverty, drug and gang-infested communities should be helped a little more by the government. I know they are capable of making their own decisions, but unfortunately many of their choices are limited to what is in front of them and what surrounds them. That's where social workers and non-profit agencies come in, to show them what is possible and what they are capable of.  So instead of reparations, the government should invest more into poverty stricken areas so the youth from these areas can grow into adults who can contribute something positive to the society. Everyone will be happy. Economy may grow because poor people will have more money to spend, crime rates may drop, and these people may hopefully live happy, drug free, and nonviolent lives. Of course this is not only for poor African Americans. It's for Whites, Latinos, Asians, Russians, and all other people who are born into poverty and bad environments.	2
"Yes, but my question is why? I admit that when I was little I thought celebrities like Hilary Duff were so cool and I was interested to watch interviews from them and stuff, but I never really wanted to be like them. There's a difference. I don't understand where that desire comes from, and I think that even if children are at an impressionable age, parents are at least somewhat capable of intervening and teaching kids that they should want to be like teachers, older siblings, and other people that they see every day. Also, I don't understand your first sentence. What do you mean when you say that celebrities need fans to ""survive""?"	they r humans right by saying this what will the other celebraties think who dont have fans is nothing only he/she is the the improtant nothing is done by fans	2
Hitler was the 3rd biggest mass murderer in history, Stalin was the 2nd biggest mass murderer in history.	Yes, that is true. Most of the kills Stalin was credited with came from starvation. This is terrible, but it is not deliberately killing in a programme. Yes, some of the starvation deaths were a deliberate programme, but not all.  Furthermore, things got better after Stalin for a bit. After Hitler they would get worse. Imagine someone like Hydrich or Himmler in power.	2
Yeah that's the only person who doesn't like him.  And His Socks ;)	Why would he not like his socks?  	2

Do you seriously watch Alex Jones psycho tales, or it's a joke?	It's not a joke and you are a misguided cretin. You cannot expect 1 photograph taken from facebook to have any real impact on the mans credibility. By all rights he's 1000x more credible then you. This video merely has him reading off the statistics. If you listen to both that video and actually look at the statistics I provided he wasn't wrong. You have been banned until you are ready to really debate this issue.	2
"Not all views on rebirth/reincarnation involve the Buddhist Nirvana, a concept which I think you have also misunderstood. An individual does not cease to exist but transcends from the ""I"" into a higher state. So there is a dissolution of the individual, but not a disappearance."	OK, makes sense I guess. This next part isn't an argument its a genuine question, what is that higher state?	2
Illegal - an act which is against the law. Immigration - to enter a country at a legal port of entry, going through the proper steps, filling out the proper documentation to become a citizen of the country into which an immigrant is entering. To enter a country illegally (especially in large numbers and often armed) is NOT immigration but an invasion.	I agree completely dude! Illegal is illegal and I really don't understand the confusion between the two that many seem to have.	2
Yes but does it really? Did our founding fathers who I remind you owned slaves truly mean for EVERYONE to be protected equally under the law?	I did not say our founding fathers I said the constitution!	2

It is appropriate to use the middle urinal if all other urinals are occupied. It's not good to waste urinal capacity. On a related note, should you make the tall guy use the urinal that is obviously meant for children.? -Yes it's funny.  -No, that's mean.	I exclusively use that urinal because I do NOT want to get the tip wet. ;)	2
So no one should be allowed to get married? Did you see my video? It raised some good points about why marriage is necessary.	No I haven't seen your video, but Marriage was made between a man and a woman. I never said that no one should get married. Look, I don't really care about gay marriage, I think there are more important problems right now then Gay marriage.	2
Do you play on a PC, X-Box 360 or PS3? Dragon Age is best played on a PC.	PS3. I'd play shit on PC, but I need to mod it up first (got the parts, just not a big enough tower)... or wait until I get myself a new laptop.	2
Gods and goddesses are not a sympathetic, understanding lot. They're more likely to horribly disfigure you for seeing them naked, or something.	I am aware of that. I meant to say something like a goddess of sympathy.	2

Are you saying that there are blacks that you would call racist... to their face I've called my family members out on it several times. Would they call themselves racist... in front of others? I used to be racist against blacks. I willingly admitted it. Would a white person call them racist... to their face? ;) Yup.	OK. You get an up vote ;)	2
Good for you!! listen most of us said not all Christians were close minded, and im sorry but i honestly don't think your christian. your family might be christian but your not. and if you do believe in god and place yourself in the category of Christianity, then you are very loose christian which is a good thing because your political views are very good!! your not against gay marriage, your centrist, open to religions, and you aren't judgeful, so in general you seem like a wonderful PERSON just not a CHRISTIAN.

Is it alright if I quote you in my book of my 101 favorite, most inventive insults?	Sure my name is either Anthony Burgess, or Stanley Kubrick, the line is from the movie '‎A Clockwork Orange', which was adapted from Burgess's novella by the same title. Not sure if line was in book, or if it was Kubrick's.	2
Well... I am a drama-llama but I've never claimed I was quitting CD because some 14 year old kid out-trolled me... That's lame.	Who are you aiming this at?  	2
I would like people to get creative and put more political, economic and foreign policy debates on.	"Getting is creative is awesome, however I find politics, economics and foreign policy to be quite boring.  Religious and Science debates are exciting because people step out of their comfort boxes and just go at it, fun stuff.  I remember when I was younger, right out of high school, when at parties, every time someone brought up religious or politics there would be such heated debates. And then I remember thinking ""Alright, no more talking about religious or politics because it leads to no where and just fighting. Everyone take a hit and bottoms up!"" Then the ""partying"" would resume about every day small talk chit chat shit. But don't get me wrong, I don't mind debating politics, economics and foreign policy. It's just mundane and not as exciting as talking about religion, science, UFOs, the ""supernatural"", the arts, music, stuff like that."	2
I have traits of a sociopath, accord to my psychiatrist. Are you religious....?	Traits of a sociopath don't always= a sociopath. Every trait of a sociopath=a sociopath. No I am not religious.  God shows the worst trait of a sociopath though. *	2

Ah, but this is where the morality comes into play. If you don't act, then yes, you indirectly killed 5 people. But, by acting, you directly kill one person. Very interesting.	That's why I dislike these morality situations. Both options suck. :/ And yes, you'd be essentially the cause of deaths either option you choose, and I believe saving five lives would be more beneficial than saving one life.	2
To me, renewing your vows is a tacit admission that you have broken them, who really cares anyways?

Oh! Right... uhhh... yeah... this iz embarrassing... O->-O	Who did you think I was talking about? <.<  	2
I imagine that had got to have been frustrating ...	Yeah, especially because we didn't know the reason for the delay at the time. Apparently he was upset about something that happened that day, so he decided to retire right then. I hope he didn't get his pension.	2

BWAH! So people who believe, I don't know, that aliens exist are in a religion of that? There is no lack of belief, there is only belief in the latter right? As soon as I think of an analogy it IS ON!	"One of the definitions of religion is: Details of belief as taught or discussed. Believing in aliens falls into this category. ;) You could use this definition instead: The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power. But technologically advanced aliens can be considered to possess superhuman controlling power. And once that is established, someone, somewhere, would worship them. Which would make it a religion. ;) You can even extend the definition: The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods. But someone, somewhere, would reason that maybe these aliens are the ones that started life on Earth (as an experiment, maybe) and that would make them the God described in the bible. Which also qualifies as a religion. ;)  BTW, If aliens started life on Earth, a lot of things would fall into place. The God in the old testament is flawed with ""human"" emotions like jealousy (Though shall not worship any other God but me), which aliens would probably possess. And it would also explain why they don't answer prayers (they can't read our minds). And why they don't intervene (They probably don't visit often). But that's the topic of another debate ;)"	2
I feel this is pretty straightforward. After all, the teacher's role in a classroom is to ensure that his/her students have learnt. Therefore, there is no point to modify materials only to place students at a disadvantageous position to learn. Changes to materials have to take into consideration the class profile and duration of lesson etc. If changes are made plainly on teachers' ideal scenarios, then learners would most likely be disengaged and unmotivated. The amount of time and effort spent on modifying the materials would then be wasted.	I agree with what Qi You had said, that indeed changes to materials have to take into consideration the class profile. Changes made to materials should not only consider HOW they're used in classroom teaching, but WHO are the changes made for. If a teacher were to adapt the materials for a low level of challenge, students would feel disinterested to learn and this would be against Principle 8 (Activities need to provide achievable challenge for learners) of MADE. After all, teachers need to make judgements about the effect of the materials on their students, who would be using them. The teacher's efforts would be futile if he/she only makes changes to a material by consider how the materials would be used in classroom teaching.  Changes made to materials need to consider HOW and WHY they are being used in classroom teaching i.e purpose. I believe that teachers should have in mind a framework of the classroom activity (eg. the use of graphic organisers) or pedagogy that they would like to use before they make any form of changes to the material.	2
He's never debated with me about anything. I like people who are engaging. :)	I appreciate your point. My job here is more to keep the peace and let users know I exist and care than engage in debate...but every once in a while I do. Feel free to suggest a topic and we can give it a whirl! I actually quite enjoy debating so much that I often get in the middle of contract negotiations at work for the sport and rush of it even though it isn't my job!	2

"Humans didn't evolve from modern day apes, but we do share a common ancestor with them. <a href='http://www.vi.cl/gepe/f33027.jpg'>Here's a very rudimentary phylogenetic tree showing some of the branches of primate evolution. A complete phylogenetic tree would have many more branches. Below is just a few of the many pieces of evidence showing that humans share a common ancestor with other primates. HUMAN CHROMOSOME 2 All great apes except humans have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Humans have only 23 pairs of chromosomes. This would typically indicate that the species are not related. However, sometimes two chromosomes can fuse together into one. Now that scientists have been able to map out the genomes of humans and other great apes they were able to look to see if there was a fused chromosome in humans that matched two chromosomes in other great apes. If they didn't find it, then that would prove that humans do not share a common ancestor with the great apes. If they did find it, then it would be yet another piece of evidence proving that humans share a common ancestor with other great apes. In 1982 they found the fused chromosome, and it matches up beautifully with those of other great apes. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_664015&feature;=iv&src;_vid=kfTbrHg8KGQ&v;=p1R8w_QEvEU'>Here is a video that explains it in more detail. ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUSES An endogenous retrovirus (ERV) is a virus that inserts itself into the DNA of germ line cell (sperm or egg). Since it has altered the DNA of a germ line cell it will be passed down to future generations of the animal that it infected. Here is a simple analogy to explain it. Think of a retrovirus as a sentence. Think of DNA as a book. The retrovirus inserts itself (the sentence) into the DNA (the book) under the chapter titled ""Reproduction."" So, now the book has an extra sentence in it. When the animal reproduces (makes a copy of the book) it will have the extra sentence in it. Throughout history lots of different species have been infected with retroviruses. I we look at the ERVs in the DNA of these different species we can see a clear pattern of one species inheriting the same retroviruses as the species they evolved from. The ERV is located in the same location of their DNA sequence as their ancestor. Let's go back to the book analogy for a second. If we look at the book titled ""Chimpanzees"" we can see that there is a sentence in red text on page 118 that says ""I'm bob, the retrovirus"". Now if we look at the book called ""Humans"" we see that it also contains the sentence ""I'm bob, the retrovirus"" on the exact same page. If we continue to examine the two books we find numerous other sentences like ""I'm Stacy, the retrovirus"", and ""I'm Kip, the retrovirus."" Both books have the same sentences on the same pages, and they are all written in red text, while the rest of the text in the book is black. If Chimpanzees and Humans were not related, the chances of them having the same ERVs in the same positions are astronomically small. The odds of just 5 matching ERVs are 1 in 2,025,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,  but we have more than a dozen. Scientists have examined the ERVs in numerous other species the results form a phylogenetic tree that closely matches the the other phylogenetic trees that scientists have created based on the fossil records, DNA analysis, hemoglobin analysis, protein sequencing, and chromosome structure. There is no way all of these trees could match up just by coincidence. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh7OclPDN_s'>Here is a video that explains how a phylogenetic tree is created based on ERVs if you're interested. <a href='http://phylointelligence.com/combined.html'>This page shows how all the phylogenetic trees match up. CRITIQUES There are some arguments against ERV, and I think it is only fair to include them. I've also included explanations as to why those arguments are not valid. <a href='http://apologeticsuk.blogspot.com/2012/01/do-shared-endogenous-retroviral.html'>Arguments against ERVs <a href='http://www.christianforums.com/t96639/'>Rebuttals to the arguments against ERVs (scroll down to the posting by WinAce) SOURCES <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805449/pdf/1742-4690-4-7.pdf'>Retroviruses targeting germ line cells <a href='http://mp.bmjjournals.com/content/56/1/11.full.pdf+html'>Demystified...Human Endogenous Retroviruses: <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10254.full'>Constructing primate phylogenies from ancient retrovirus sequences <a href='http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/  10.1371/journal.pone.0001026'>Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys <a href='http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061030183232.htm'>Phoenix Rising - Scientists Resuscitate A 5 Million-Year-Old Retrovirus"	"Very interesting.

Islamic woman can feel herself as weak gender, realize herself as mother, wife that is the main goal of women compraring with western example where man and woman have approximately equal rights, but duties. Any woman, even though she has successful career growth, salary, exciting life, kids, husband, many nurces and money, she wants to actualize her duties as woman, to be free from work, to care about husband, cooking etc. Can western women always allow the mselves to relax about income of the family? I thing there are pros and cons everywhere. But some people do not want to accept another culture, because what is acceptable in one region, not acceptable in other.	I don't think you understand what I meant. Islamic women don't have a choice. Western women do.	2
Jesus had an earthly mother who took care of Him.  	Yeah, yeah... I know that... that slut Mary... but I'm talking about God! Who gave birth to him?	2
Yes, I agree it should definitely be more proper, but the question I think that has to be answered is what is proper? Sure, it might seem nasty: a bullet to the head, dropping to the ground as it does in the video, and its appendages stretching outward, but the video doesn't really tell you that much. Is the horse dead? If it kills it nearly instantaneously, I'd say that's the proper way to do it. Butchering them brutally, harming them in any way beforehand - that's all wrong; never be sadistic about it! As in all things, try to be efficient and honorable.	To be efficient and honorable.  This what many humans in life view as the basis of balance and figuring out what the hell is going on around us.	2
This man was a savoy politician who stepped on the constitution, centralized power, started a war over slavery (which every other major power was able to solve peacefully) and wanted to send all African-Americans back to Africa... why do we give this bastard any credit at all?

I'm not interested in doing deep research on this, however, here are a couple I pulled out that sure seem to indicate such a thing- Luke 9:27- But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God Matthew 24:34- Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place.	"I'm not interested in doing deep research on this, however, here are a couple I pulled out that sure seem to indicate such a thing That's fine. I wasn't suggesting that you do any deep research though. I was just wondering if you had any idea how the verses you were referring to from Matthew and Mark went. Luke 9:27- But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God When you read it in context with the following verse, it goes like this: ""But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."" I think what that means, is that certain individuals (Peter, John and James in particular), were to receive a glimpse of Heaven before they died. Matthew 24:34- Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. Yeah, this one's a little odd. Some interpret this as the generation being Israel... but in any other spot in the Bible, whenever the term generation is used, it's referring to people of that time period. So, I guess it depends on how you interpret it. Either way, I don't think he was saying that they would live for about 2000 years. It seems to me that he was implying that his second coming would occur within that century."	2

I won't argue that no Buddhist takes drugs because I'm sure some do even though it is forbidden, a bit like a Jew eating Pork etc I'm sure it happens but it doesn't make the whole religion pro drugs. Meditation is all about freeing your mind, this can be done using drugs but that is a short cut, to meditate properly your mind has to be clear which it isn't when your high, a lot of Buddhists meditate before breakfast then go about their day, then before bed. As for your mind obesity claim, I have one thing to say Shaolin Monks those dudes are ripped!!	Wait..., wait..., are you saying that not all Christians are homophobic? Dude, you just blew my mind ;)	2
Do I agree? What is that supposed to mean? If you meant to say '' do you support the paparazzi taking pictures of celebrities children'' .. then no. The children never had a say in whether they want to be in the paper or not, they most certainly did not choose or try to become famous themselves. It is against the Constitution, which claims everyone has the right to privacy.	It isn't an invasion of privacy if the children are in public view. You have a right to privacy where privacy is required or permitted. For example a restroom or a changing room. However if you are just walking the streets, most likely, pictures can be taken.	2
We have quite a view Christians. Like Trollzors, and Srom. There are a bunch of people on here who are willing to defend religion. Don't forget Centifolia.	Trollzors ?	2

Why? Lets examine what we know. We know that we exist. We know (or we will assume, as we both agree on this) that all we know, space, time, and all the matter that we can observe, came into existence from the Big Bang a few billion years ago. That does not require that a higher power created the singularity that came before. It certainly does not require that a sentient higher power (God) created the singularity. Essentially, we just don't know. We just know it's nothing ordinary: that does not mean exceptionally powerful. Also, how you use the word is somewhat relative. In an existence of many more dimensions than we know, no time or space or matter as we now know it, anything would be seen as 'powerful' to us. That does not require that something is a higher power. What I meant when I said there must be something powerful, I meant because life is so precious and .. rare if I can say that. It is extremely weird - we don't understand it in any way, or do we? Didn't we do that with Dolly, in 1996? Cloning is quite a common procedure nowadays, it was recently in the news that the Olympics will accept cloned horses into events (and it's likely that there will be cloned horses in 2016. Cloning humans could definitely be done if it were allowed (they may not be healthy, but they would be undeniably human). Yes there was a sheep right?! I really don't understand the process of a clone - and can't really tell you if I think that, the one or the ones who created Dolly, created life. I doubt this - but I am not so clever in the subject, so I'm not gonna state anything :p	It is extremely weird - we don't understand it in any way, or do we? Not really. And that is why whatever position you take (theism or atheism), it's always better to have an agnostic belief. Yes there was a sheep right?! A sheep has a conscious, and its mind was just as healthy as anyone else. Creating life isn't particularly difficult anymore, is my only point. But yes, I'll let you decide how much you agree in your own time.	2
The biggest problem is environment! It created us! And we destroy it! And this is the thing that will happen: it will get angry and destroy us!	the biggest problem is the environment. we should actuall save the environment because it is our creator and it also is our destroyer and getting angry on us and destroying us is all very easy for it.........................................	2
Wow, do you possibly know the specific details that caused the upbringing of this conflict?	Here is an interview with Dave, I guess he wasn't happy, pretty interesting interview with Dave.	2
only you said so, not me say one hor.  anyway who said those people are stupid? Maybe they have a lack of knowledge. Its their own opinion car brand toyota	<a href='http://www.toyotaownersclub.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19377'>http://www.toyotaownersclub.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19377  That's how you turn off the airbags on toyota. anyway who said those people are stupid? Maybe they have a lack of knowledge. Its their own opinion If they're opinion is, that children are safer in the back despite what tests and facts sais and traffic experts say, then I would allow myself to call them stupid. BUT, you I wouldn't call a person who says that children should be allowed to sit in front, stupid. If he thinks the child is safer there, then he is stupid. If he just thinks it should be allowed for them to sit there, then he is not stupid (maybe he is, but not in that area .. if you understand ? ) I don't understand the first line you wrote, sorry.	2
To be sure that there is no god doesn't necessarily mean you believe he doesn't exist. It just means you don't believe he exists. I am trying to think of an example of this. Believing a thing. Is not the same as not believing a thing does not not exist. Is that confusing? I think it is.	There is only belief and certainty. You believe on something, or not, because you are not certain but you have to pick one so... You are certain of something so belief doesn't enter into the equation and you have no choice but to pick that which you know to be certain. If you believe something, that's your religion ;)	2
But, they're parts still go together...Just kidding, well I guess that is true but I'm a Christian so gay marriage seems wrong	Well at least you can admit that it's your religion. Though my atheist compadres on this site tell me that the parts of the bible condemning homsexuality is apart of Leviticus, a portion that Christians don't seem to follow, except for that one part.	2
You seriously said almost nothing regarding the debate, you didn't even really voice your opinion =\	OK, fair enough.  If the future is encoded in dreams, then we have lost the knowledge to decode our dreams because I don't know of anyone who can predict the future based on his dreams. Thus, having lost the knowledge to decode our dreams is the same thing as not being able to predict the future through our dreams.	2
I love being treated like shit.... sooooooo..... yeah... stick to the rule.	Is that why you put up with me ;)	2
If that happens not only will there be a zombie apocalypse, there will also be a vampire apocalypse	Vampires vs. Zombies. My money is on the vampires. Although, what happens if you get a vampire zombie?	2
People who couldn't afford health care would just show up at the emergency room and get patched up. Then the people who could afford health care would end up subsidizing the first group in the form of higher health care cost. Now, with Obama care, people who can't afford health care will probably get a card and people who can afford it will subsidize the first group in the form of higher health care cost. Wait..., why that freaking Obama ;)	So the only difference is some form of healthcare card?	2
"That is a poor argument. If you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using ""what I've been told"" as an argument. Your opposition will tear you apart. :)  Think about a specific statement that you think you can prove through a series of logical arguments regardless of your personal feelings on the subject and invite me to a private debate on it. I am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others I have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. If you agree, of course."	"That is a poor argument.

Dogs Dogs Dogs! I think that dogs are a lot friendlier than cats besides I don't know why but everytime I come across a cat it hisses at me.	Why does that cat thing not surprise me? hehehe! ;)	2
Take measures?how? you never know where it will be or even when. U know? people dont order this kind of things as a pizza.	But some how in other countries people do this. In USA there where plenty of incidents where police of FBI(i dont know) stops terrorist attack. After 9/11 of course.	2
I live in a society where I can get any education free - elementary, secondary and further, if I want to become a nurse, doctor or whatever. It is not totally free, but almost. This is a of course really good, free education, who doesn't want that? Well, our taxes are high as fuck. I am 17 years old, I earn about 500-1000$ a month, and I pay 40% in taxes. My dad, who earns about 7000$ a month pays 60% in taxes. I am grateful that I go to secondary school totally free, but I would rather have the extra money I pay in taxes.	Confused... your profile says you live in the United States?	2
Haha!! Like that episode of Family Guy............................................	Yeah...., just like that ;)	2
Yes it actually as been boring for me because I can't find any interesting debates and others create debates and getting faster points but I just reply to debates because I can't think of good debate topics because some people already created them.  I can't find a topic that really am interested in and every time when I get on here I just don't know what to do sometimes I am too lazy to reply back to someone or deal with their disputes because to me its slowly boring me.	Yeah, same with me here. I find it weird when people make debates and arguments, but then, it is a useless argument, wherein you can't find a good side because they are not even giving you any options. I've been here just a few days but I find it a little boring cause I see debates who repeats another debate made in the past.	2
"Come on, I've never even heard of ""Roblox""? Stop talking gibberish and come dig a hole with me."	I have played Roblox before its basically a game where you make a place, and you can make anything from this place and people can come and visit your game. Every time when someone visits your place you get 1 ticket and tickets can be used to purchase clothing on that site. You start off when you make your account with 10 tickets and you get 10 tickets every time you login to Roblox Its a free to play game, but there is options to join Builders Club which is a thing where you can get more places and get Robux which is basically like money, and you can purchase things like gear which can be unique sword, or items that can be played it some games if they allow it.	2
You're also bound by European law that states that the press have freedom of expression. There's a conflict.	Freedom to express their opinions, not freedom to post pictures of other people	2
"Prove what to you?! That you did not get most of your morals from religion. Somewhere in your bloodline is religious followers who passed down their morals. Maybe you think you received your morals from society... well where do you think their morals came from?  You give me some solid proof that it DOES!  How about a college education on the subject? How about the fact that I have brought my studies on the topic beyond college? You do understand that I am not arguing that religions are correct, don't you? I am trying to get you to realize that although you are an athiest, your life has been greatly influenced by religions.  the proof I have is that, basically, there is no religion to have given me morals. That isn't proof. Although you are an athiest, it wouldn't hurt you to learn more about the world you live in and study some religions. You don't even understand what you oppose. Buddhism is a good example, I left you an argument a few days ago on the topic of whether or not Buddhism is a religion. I did this because your original response was so far from the truth, that I just could not ignore it. And trust me, there is much more solid proof showing religion doesn't exist as appose to a bunch of brainwashed morons who believe on walking and water and all that crap! There is ""solid proof"" showing that RELIGION does not exist? Well damn, I'd like to see that! The argument you are referring to is whether or not GOD exists, not religion. We don't know if he exists or not. I don't care how many Big Bang Theories you have heard, that still does not mean that a higher being does not exist. Same goes for Christians or any other religion, they can preach all they want but it does not convince me that what they say is correct. That is why I am in the middle, an agnostic, just as everyone should be. Does God exist? I don't fucking know! That's not what this debate is about. I'm telling you that your life has been greatly influenced by religion. Do you celebrate Christmas? That is a Christian holiday. Maybe you just put up a christmas tree... Well that was a pagan tradition. How about marriage... Your parents are/were married, correct? You plan on getting married right? Well you can thank religion for that. The wedding ring tradition dates back to Paganism as well. For adultery to be commited, one must be married, correct? So if marriage is a religious tradition and adultery is seen as immoral, wouldn't that mean that this view stems directly from religion? This is just one example. Can you still honestly deny that religion has not affected your life and some of your views?"	That was the most rational argument on the issue of religon i have ever seen. I wish more people would listen to you.	2
Jews are the ones who believe in the old testamente. I'm a christian, therefore my beliefs are in the new one. But if I have to think .. like what is more interesting to read, the old testamente has way better stories. I love love love the story about Esther, and have read it like.. a hundred times since I was very little Ruth, Moses, Noah, Samson, Saul, Jonah, Josva.. I love those stories. (If I spelled some of the names wrong, remember english is not my main language, so the names are probably different than in the english bible)	"""Jews are the ones who believe in the Old Testament"" Christianity is based upon Judaism. Jesus was Jewish as a child. Therefore Christians believe in both - I don't think Jews believe in the new one, but Christians believe in both.  You may not, and I don't know if you are Jewish, or you just prefer the New Testament, but Christians believe in both."	2
It is private since I live in a private neighborhood. We pay HOA fees for the upkeep.	Do you like the service and upkeep? -------------------------- If yes, then you can see why parks in private hands are better.	2
I'm neither supporting or disputing this. I just don't think there's enough information available. He was no Christian, that much is for sure. He sounds like an atheist; but even then that's not entirely clear either and I don't want to append that label to him with such scant evidence. So...I'm on the fence with this one.	I agree that he was not a christian, but he was a theist. There are plenty of nonchristian theists. :)	2
"""Then other religious headgear should be banned on that grounds too right"" Absolutely. One must be easily identifiable from his identification."	Safety should trump all, even religion. It's the basic agreement we make by entering society.	2
Indians don't eat beef... most Indian restaurants don't serve beef.	Well let me clear that up for you now, Indians eat beef. The Indians you're talking about are typically of the Hinduism belief and many of them are strict vegetarians all their life. You also get muslim indians and other hindus that aren't vegans. You get beef curry! I've personally made it myself. You get beef mince curry, beef samoosas, beef and lentils, beef karahi (if you've seen that on the menu, only it would say vegetable karahi) you need to go a different restuarant pal, the indian restuarants in South Africa sell beef.	2
"If you really want to debate this all you have to do is just actually do some research. I know for a fact that beinglostats has researched the core economic problems that are haunting us as a nation. Specifically, fiat currency and the role of the Federal Reserve system. And ergo, that is why he stated what he did in his post, ""this financial crisis looms deeper""."	Indeed it does loom deeper and you can actually go as far the first Great Depression for seeds that were planted then leading up to now. Fiat money is mostly to blame there is no real value to back the dollar and to make is sustainable. Going back to Gold standard would help guard against these bubbles. I was reading and saw that we have had 22 recessions over the last 100 years most averaging about 2.5 years. I wonder where this one is going to rank? Sadly I think we are entering into a recession that will take 4 or more years to recover.	2
I think it's a great idea. Most homeless people have no way of communicating with people who care about them (such as family), which leads to detachment from society and perpetuates the homeless cycle.	It's good to see that a company as large as Google is making such a positive impact on society. Instead of just dumping their money into homeless shelters or soup kitchens, they are providing these individuals with a basic tool for success.	2
OH YES THEY ARE, AND A CONFUSING ONE TOO. But by golly, they are an adorable one indeed.	screw you jack-hole!!! answer the debate or get the fuck out of here!!!!!!	2
English is actually one of the official languages of Puerto Rico. Although many speak Spanish, they are taught English from elementary school to high school and even into college.	"I have been living in P.R since 2007, and although ""officially "" the languages of P.R are English and Spanish , outside the tourist areas of Old San Juan , El Yunque and etc. Spanish is the primary language used in government offices. As for the results of the plesibite the form ( yes we use paper ballots) was self explanatory, and yes the option of commonwealth was there. It asked you if you were satisfied with the current status , yes or no. If you voted no you had the 3 options : statehood, free association and independence, also the ballot was in English and Spanish with the definitions of each of the previous options."	2
What was the change, and the system beforehand?	People who couldn't afford health care would just show up at the emergency room and get patched up. Then the people who could afford health care would end up subsidizing the first group in the form of higher health care cost. Now, with Obama care, people who can't afford health care will probably get a card and people who can afford it will subsidize the first group in the form of higher health care cost. Wait..., why that freaking Obama ;)	2
"""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" can be interpreted as being both the freedom of and freedom from religion"	Again I see one but I don't see the other. The language used is nor prohibit the free exserse thereof not nor prohibit the lack of religious exercise .	2
I agree that spending an entire day in front of a TV is bad at any age, however, not enough people look at the ramifications of watching too LITTLE TV. Until age 13 I rarely watched any TV.	All those posts couod have been posted at once. You didnt have to break it up.	2
I actually have to disagree with you on hoe Activation only cares about capping zombies. The only episode that isn't out yet is the last one and so far they've done a pretty good job with the story line and choice you have to make.	I don't think you're getting me. There are two different Walking Dead games. There is the really great story-focused episodes with all of the choice that Telltale Games made. Then there is the one that Activision is making, which is a normal zombie shooter with a TV series license. The Activision one is not the one with the episodes. Like I said, I should have clarified it above better.	2
Because one claims to be in accordance with God's view, does not mean they are.	Too bad atheist aren't half as smart as they think they are, special education teachers would be out of a job.	2
not kony himself but the movement is it used to get oil reserves in Uganda?	no they do not use kony as a reason for oil reserves in uganda. Where did you get that source?	2
Sadly, even though the op has been posting ridiculous debates the whole time he's been on CD, I know someone who actually doesn't think that dinosaurs ever existed. He believes that God put the fossils and bones on the earth to test Christians. THAT is what he told me. As a woman of science, I almost slapped him. But since I AM a lady, I simply walked away.	Well I hope that never stops you from slapping me. ;)	2
To have a debate 'controversy' is necessary; there must be a conflict of interest or/and a difference of opinion between two or more sides. In academic debate, understanding, learning and knowledge are important. One side has to take on the 'burden of proof' to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt! That side is the affirmative side in academic debate. Debating is not an easy thing to participate in; you have to be very aware of issues and to have a way of putting you argument across succinctly with economy of expression so that the audience and the judges can follow your train of thought; whether it is deductive or inductive reasoning that your using.  Beware of those who create fallacies to draw you into an erroneous conclusion to an argument.	Wise words. I didn't fully understand it, but I got the jist of it. :D :D. (D/W I know what you're syaing)	2
"I understand preachers have ""thumped"" out 6 DAYS not billions of years since the idea of billions of years reached their ears.But ""day ""in Hebrew has several possible meanings. One of those meanings is ""age"" or an unspecified amount of time. <a href='http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/'>http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/ See the ""Days of Genesis"" portion"	I see what your saying. I know my friend was saying that a day to the lord is like a thousand years in human time. So I see your point.	2

"I'm just wondering what it means when someone says ""it is what it is."""	To me it means that the thing is exactly what it is. If it is a donut it is a donut.	2
It seems that would be more a matter of altering indecency laws correct?  You would need to track the makers and make said porn illegal, not track those who watch the porn, if the worry is impressionable youngsters turning into sex-crazed rapists and murderers. I'm a bit vague on precisely where the line should be drawn though. I believe the types of BDSM sites you are speaking of require a credit card which would mean someone over 18. The free porn teens are stuck with don't have the hard core stuff you're referring to, to my extensive knowledge on the subject at least :/	I don't know about you but being a teen I mix with teens, and out of the amount of them that I associate with the majority already have their own cards set up by parents. Others have access to their parents card with no restrictions. Plus I have heard of ( Not confirmed) people talking about forums and things like them about how to capture and use people with out their consent. These move sites as soon as they are found. Hell I have seen pretty WTF stuff in my little brothers games. (He is 14)	2
Besides a few battles, the French just used the war as an opportunity to raid the British navy (mainly its merchant fleet) while the British Empire tried to put down a revolution in America and take over Dutch colonies in West Africa.	You  bet! Allons enfants de la patrie..!	2

He was a Christian in his youth but he turned away from the faith and if he was a Christian then why did he kill millions of Jews? Christians are supposed to be respectful of the Jews because they believe in same God we do.	The Catholic church at the time were far from respectful of the Jews (because they were the ones who apparently got Jesus crucified). Hitler being brought up in a Catholic home could of led to some resentment of the Jews.  What he did though was nothing to do with the church, it was just some twisted view of an Aryan race and a few other things.	2
Hey, I'm going to send you a message here in a minute or two so check you mail....	Hehe ok :) goes to check mail	2
I like the New Testament better because Jesus Christ came down to earth to save us from our sins and died on the cross and rose again from the grave. Without the resurrection are teachings would be worthless and our worship to God would be delusional.	Worship me for I can do magic !	2
JUST BECAUSE HITLER SAID HE IS FIGHTING IT doesn't mean he was telling the truth. He acted as a socialist. He fought capitalism. Just listen, Hitler liked to have governmental control only when necessary. Once the war was over he was always planning on making a brutally aristocratic state (but this time the aristocrats would be Aryans as opposed to Jews). Hitler had no plans of having a non-nationalized economy. His post-war plans was to develop the lands he had claimed for Germany, enslave the slavs and eventually expand the empire even further.	You and I have opposing views on Hitler's post-war plans. Since Hitler never had the chance to implement them it's open to subjective speculation, there's no way to determine if you or I is the right one.	2
OK so im 13 and i think i get what the question means but again im 13 so dont laugh if im way off. WHY THE FUCK WOULD AMERICA BOMB ITS OWN BUILDINGS THREE TIMES!

The poll found that Arabs were more likely to believe 9/11 conspiracy theories THOES 15% are fudging stupid like fo realz but idk  GOD BLESS US OF A	"""WHY THE FUCK WOULD AMERICA BOMB ITS OWN BUILDINGS THREE TIMES! "" Fear is an excellent tool to manipulate the masses, people need to beleive that fear which is perpetuated by the media isn't simply irrational, therefore it is entirely conceivable that a false flag event, even of the scale of 9/11, could be carried out.

Well was that on a completly open battlefield. usaully the hoplites stand their ground and dont move. Much for defensive reasons. does anyone agree?	Not so much defense as common sense. Its called a wheel principal. No matter how fast you are, even in mounted units, the further you are from the center of focus the slower you react. For example some of the outer planets move faster than earth, yet we have a shorter year because we have less space to travel. This is why infantry is so effective against mounted units. Despite their lack of mobility, as the center of focus they still have the practical advantage in reaction time and control the engagements.	2
The first Muslims were converted because of promised military conquest.  And no I believe what I do because I searched for what else he could be and they all don't line up. Crazyman, a really good teacher who stories were embellished, snake salesmen, rabbi (a variation on the good teacher), a physician way advanced for his time. All don't line up right.	"If none of the answers you come up with line up, the proper response is ""I don't know"", not, he is the son of God, broke the laws of physics, raised a zombie army, resurrected, appeared as a ghost, and will return to Earth in the second coming."	2
"An absolute monarch had the ""divine right of kings"". They had much more influence over a much larger population of people. This would lower oppression by major amounts."	They were basically equal in any regards of actual power. Dictators have powerful armies, so do kings. I only see being able to pick your heir as a major decider of which is better. It's better for the next generation.	2
Have you never popped a cherry ;)	what are you trying to fix when you are fking some chicks brains out? Nothing. That's entertainment	2
Well, we all know you're an antisemitic so.....	In other words I am not specifically antisemitic, just anti religion. Give me any religion and I will argue to my fullest extend against it. The other debate was on Israel. Being anti-Israel is not antisemitic.  And someone tell GuitarGuy that I was wrong, it's not only when people insult me I get offended, it's when people label me too :P	2
OK, so my plan was to hide with that Assage guy in the Embassy of Ecuador but then I remembered what they did to the Embassies in the Middle East. Now I don't know where I'd hide.

Hunger. Have you ever read the book  Alive?	Yes, it was pretty terrible (what happened not the book). Btw, if you feed bacon to a pig, is it technically cannibalism?	2
It wont let me join. There's something wrong with the link. Btw, if you create a debate in the regular CD and then go to the debate you just created and click on the star (white with yellow edges) then a window pops up and you can select your site. The the star will turn totally yellow. This way people will see it on regular CD and when people post to it they will be posting on your site. Hmmm, I just checked and your site is not listed.

Also, I do see the site listed... you mean on the <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/site/sitelist'>explore debate communities link, right? I see it as the sixth one in the list. I know about the debate star. I've used it before. But the point of the group is to avoid the... less interesting people... that have a tendency to overrun the main page. I was thinking that making the debates unique to the group would get people going to the group site over the main site.	2
I think he does, but did you really have to put up a debate like this? It's a little unnecessary.	I've been calling him on it for as long as I've been here, and he simply continued to deny it and dodge and lie. I felt that, yes, this debate is mean and rude but justified. It finally got the message accross, didn't it?	2
What is the job of a politician? Can they do their job properly without being honest? I would argue that letting voters know exactly how and when they are going to fuck us is what their job is ideally all about.	I agree with that... problem is most people don't want to hear the bad news so the way the system is set up... it encourages the candidates to lie to us so they can get elected.... then we get disappointed with the results.	2
Most of the smokers I know are motivated too, but not to the end of making marijuana legal. They're motivated in their day-to-day lives. They work hard, keep clean houses, etc. And they're philosophical in terms of sitting around and having an intense debate about issues that matter.

"Humans didn't evolve from modern day apes, but we do share a common ancestor with them. <a href='http://www.vi.cl/gepe/f33027.jpg'>Here's a very rudimentary phylogenetic tree showing some of the branches of primate evolution. A complete phylogenetic tree would have many more branches. Below is just a few of the many pieces of evidence showing that humans share a common ancestor with other primates. HUMAN CHROMOSOME 2 All great apes except humans have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Humans have only 23 pairs of chromosomes. This would typically indicate that the species are not related. However, sometimes two chromosomes can fuse together into one. Now that scientists have been able to map out the genomes of humans and other great apes they were able to look to see if there was a fused chromosome in humans that matched two chromosomes in other great apes. If they didn't find it, then that would prove that humans do not share a common ancestor with the great apes. If they did find it, then it would be yet another piece of evidence proving that humans share a common ancestor with other great apes. In 1982 they found the fused chromosome, and it matches up beautifully with those of other great apes. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_664015&feature;=iv&src;_vid=kfTbrHg8KGQ&v;=p1R8w_QEvEU'>Here is a video that explains it in more detail. ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUSES An endogenous retrovirus (ERV) is a virus that inserts itself into the DNA of germ line cell (sperm or egg). Since it has altered the DNA of a germ line cell it will be passed down to future generations of the animal that it infected. Here is a simple analogy to explain it. Think of a retrovirus as a sentence. Think of DNA as a book. The retrovirus inserts itself (the sentence) into the DNA (the book) under the chapter titled ""Reproduction."" So, now the book has an extra sentence in it. When the animal reproduces (makes a copy of the book) it will have the extra sentence in it. Throughout history lots of different species have been infected with retroviruses. I we look at the ERVs in the DNA of these different species we can see a clear pattern of one species inheriting the same retroviruses as the species they evolved from. The ERV is located in the same location of their DNA sequence as their ancestor. Let's go back to the book analogy for a second. If we look at the book titled ""Chimpanzees"" we can see that there is a sentence in red text on page 118 that says ""I'm bob, the retrovirus"". Now if we look at the book called ""Humans"" we see that it also contains the sentence ""I'm bob, the retrovirus"" on the exact same page. If we continue to examine the two books we find numerous other sentences like ""I'm Stacy, the retrovirus"", and ""I'm Kip, the retrovirus."" Both books have the same sentences on the same pages, and they are all written in red text, while the rest of the text in the book is black. If Chimpanzees and Humans were not related, the chances of them having the same ERVs in the same positions are astronomically small. The odds of just 5 matching ERVs are 1 in 2,025,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,  but we have more than a dozen. Scientists have examined the ERVs in numerous other species the results form a phylogenetic tree that closely matches the the other phylogenetic trees that scientists have created based on the fossil records, DNA analysis, hemoglobin analysis, protein sequencing, and chromosome structure. There is no way all of these trees could match up just by coincidence. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh7OclPDN_s'>Here is a video that explains how a phylogenetic tree is created based on ERVs if you're interested. <a href='http://phylointelligence.com/combined.html'>This page shows how all the phylogenetic trees match up. CRITIQUES There are some arguments against ERV, and I think it is only fair to include them. I've also included explanations as to why those arguments are not valid. <a href='http://apologeticsuk.blogspot.com/2012/01/do-shared-endogenous-retroviral.html'>Arguments against ERVs <a href='http://www.christianforums.com/t96639/'>Rebuttals to the arguments against ERVs (scroll down to the posting by WinAce) SOURCES <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805449/pdf/1742-4690-4-7.pdf'>Retroviruses targeting germ line cells <a href='http://mp.bmjjournals.com/content/56/1/11.full.pdf+html'>Demystified...Human Endogenous Retroviruses: <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10254.full'>Constructing primate phylogenies from ancient retrovirus sequences <a href='http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/  10.1371/journal.pone.0001026'>Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys <a href='http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061030183232.htm'>Phoenix Rising - Scientists Resuscitate A 5 Million-Year-Old Retrovirus"	It is worth adding Cytochrome C. CytC is a protein conserved in all species, with the protein being identical in everything from yeast to humans. The way DNA maps to protein means that a particular combination of 3 base pairs corresponds to 1 amino acid in a protein. However, there are more than 1 combination of three base pairs that give the same amino acid, meaning that there is more than one sequence of DNA that can yield an identical protein. This means random mutations over time can add changes into the cytochrome C gene and not modify the protein that it produces at all. Cytochrome C genes in many species have been analysed, with the comparative differences of the cytc gene matching exactly the prediction of common descent. This is not a trivial correlation, with the number of possible combinations and arrangements of the cyt c gene being in the order of 10^38. But to clarify, as well as having massive incontrovertible evidence of common descent, including this, the phylogenic tree, the innumerable transitional form that shows the progressive evolution of hominids, DNA analysis, and the stuff above; it is clear that not only did we evolve from apes, we are still apes. There is no objective way to classify or group different species of ape in a way that excludes humans.	2
He brutally murdered the mother stabbing her multiple times in the head.	What's your point? Everyone that stabs someone in the head should be killed? I don't agree. I feel intense situations that cause someone to kill are not black and white, and that if the person had a justifiable cause for it, a punishment should be given, but the death penalty should be retained for people who are a lost cause, or at the very least, seem, like it.	2
Zombi, the root of the word are just a voodoo poisoning-brainwashing trick. The modern idea of 'zombies' are actually vampires. Who don't eat brains.

At any given moment there may be millions or even billions of civilisations amongst the stars, but space is so vast that we never see them and can only speculate. It's likely the same for them too, the vast majority would be too distant to communicate with each other.	And yet, is there not just as great a chance that there is but one 'civilization', if you can even call us that? Or are you going to use Schroedinger's Cat, stating that, until evidence that they either exist or do not exist, we can assume both?	2

Is second class fingers and third class the shaft? If so what is the equivalent for a woman raping someone?	"I shall paste my reply to TheThinker here: In murder, in burns, in theft and many other crimes there are scales of measuring the severity of them, most commonly (although in theft there are four) there are three classes of the crime. Rape is merely any form, whatsoever, of sexually connoted assault. In the first class division is the type of rape whereby permanent scars and/or broken bones are left for the victim to deal with, any and all paedophilic rape (including something as simple as a forced kiss to an under 18 year old) falls under this category. In the second class category is the type of rape whereby any severe bruising or temporary effects are left/seen on the victim. It also depends on whether or not there was any verbal threat involved. If the person,a t any point in the rape, said something along the lines of ""I will kill you"" or ""I will break you"" or something that is a threat of the actions of a first class rape, they could, depending how good or bad the lawyers representing the defendant and victim are, could get them done for first class rape instead. Essentially second class rape is simply brutal sex where there didn't appear to be any consent from the other party. Third class rape is any sexual act done onto a non-minor that isn't anything past second base but still is totally and utterly without the victim's consent."	2

There's only 2 reasons here. 2 is a qualifier to 1.  Ignoring that, I don't think it will happen because Jesus's FIRST coming hasn't even been totally proven and if he did exist there are far too many unproven events surrounding him. That, and the main god supposedly behind all this is shrouded in untruth as well.	I validate your concern. I call myself a skeptical theist. My attitude when people tell me to have faith: give me a reason. When they give me a reason: prove it. When they cannot prove it: leave me alone. i guess my point is that I understand. Now for my question: what is the basis for what you believe? What lead you to each conclusion?	2

The question is: should we attribute any free will and moral consciousness to soldiers or not? Soldiers are no automatons, so yes, they do bear responsibility for their own contribution in a war that was never just to fight. If we can hold soldiers responsible for going to war, this might me an important extra bar against unjust wars.	Agreed. War does not occur without the application of force. That force is military. Being in a hive mindset does not give ones individual actions immunity. If anything, being in such a mindset should further the crimes against one such person.	2
"Simply because we have been made into the image of God, it does not mean that we should assume that we will be exactly like God. But to answer the point of the trinity, it is not one person, but two, who come together to form the reflected image of the trinity. In Genesis, while in the garden, God said that Adam and Eve became ""one flesh."" Moreover, the intention of God, and what He will restore in the end times, will be the continued relationship of God to His people. Hence, in the world today, we are to reflect the image of God by joining in union with a spouse, though not necessarily as 1 Corinthian 7 says, and to become one flesh, and while being in relation with God. In absolution, the church as a whole is Jesus' wife, while Jesus is the husband. Therefore, we have another reflection of the image of God, and the Trinity, since God the Father is the one who gives the church to Jesus. There is much more, if you want to go into theology, but this should suffice to answer the question."	Oh, so He created is in His image except for those parts that He didn't create in His image, cool.	2

Chewing gum is really gross. Chewing-Gum I hate the most.	I look up American definition for mint. It say this. Main Entry: 1mint Pronunciation: \ˈmint\ Function: noun Etymology: Middle English minte, from Old English, from Latin mentha, menta; akin to Greek minthē mint Date: before 12th century 1 : any of a family (Labiatae, the mint family) of aromatic plants with a square stem and a 4-lobed ovary which produces four one-seeded nutlets in fruit ; especially : any of a genus (Mentha) of mints that have white, purple, or pink verticillate flowers with a nearly regular corolla and four equal stamens and that include some used in flavoring and cookery.

"Not every civilization has had shaman, or their equivalents. It doesn't really matter though, because the more I think about it the more I realize that it's pointless to debate the origin of marriage. First of all, it predates recorded history, so no one really knows the true origin; it's all just speculation. Second, it really has no bearing on what marriage is today. Just because something was one way in the past, does not mean it will always be that way. As I said in my original argument, marriage ""has taken many forms throughout history including polygamy, polygyny, polyandry, endogamy, exogamy, common law marriage, monogamy, arranged marriage, and same sex marriage."" So, clearly the definition of marriage has changed many times throughout history and will continue to change. Most people today think of marriage as making a commitment to someone you love."	I agree. There is no point in debating the origin of marriage. So let's take it to another level. Do you see any value in creating a word analogous to marriage but that can only be used by the other side (the 2 sides being religion and government). I propose we reserve one word for religious purposes and use the other word for civil purposes. I don't care which side ends up with the word marriage as long as we have 2 words to differentiate what we are talking about. I loath making words more ambiguous. I prefer words with clear meaning. But hey..., that's just me ;)	2

The implication that the amount of points is good or amazing can be the intention of the teller or imbedded in the tone of how the teller says it.

"Only time and knowledge perceived as coming from self can open a closed mind. When I make fun bigotry it is as effective to the individual as when I or you explain it rationally, that is to say it is not."" I see no reason to assume they have a closed mind. Maybe they are just misinformed and haven't heard an explanation as to why their logic is invalid. For the sake of argument lets assume they are a troll and have a closed mind. Other people read these debates, and some of them may not have closed minds. If they see an argument from someone that is being rude, they will be less likely to take it seriously. Even though the logical thing to do would be to weigh the arguments based on their merits instead of how friendly or rudely they are presented, the fact of the matter is that people don't always do that. People instinctually heed the words of friendly people more than those of someone that is being mean. What treating it as valid, whether you believe it to be valid or not, does to is lend unearned authority to the opinion in question. How is explaining the flaws in someone's logic treating is a valid? It's the exact opposite of treating it as valid. Just because I choose to explain to them in a friendly way instead of an aggressive way to does mean I am treating it as valid. I will stop making fun of anti-gay sentiment framed from a moral superior soap box on the day anti-gay individuals cease their relentless pursuit of discrimination. I think maybe you are reading to much into what they said. They are under the impression that marriage is a religious thing, which is a very common misconception I hear all the time from religious people. Given their misunderstanding of marriage, it's not illogical for them to wonder why ""gays that don't really care for God, the bible"" would want to be part of it. As it stands, asking whether this person is a small child is hardly equivalent to actively protesting the rights in real life of tens or hundreds of thousands of people. I never said it was equivalent. I think you're missing my point. I want discrimination against gays to stop just as much as you do, but I choose to talk to people in a friendly way because the chances of me changing someone's mind by name calling and aggression is less likely to be successful."	2

There already is.... I'm sitting in my backyard, the weather is perfect.... I've got a beer and my laptop and I must say... it's pretty fucking peaceful.	Yup, peace exists in pockets all over the earth like this guys backyard. But, will there be peace everywhere all at once ever? Nope.	2
We don't use the title 'Boyfriend' it's too demanding. We just meet up and get it on every now and then.	"Although you are a Green Party 'insert ""joke here"" definition' I didn't know you we're so particular about labels.  That being said; where do you usually meet up?"	2
"Why aren't you getting it? Chronos is a god, google his name, it will say the Roman god or deity of whatever. Deities are what makes a person theist. Belief in the existence of a god or gods, esp. belief in one god as creator of the universe, intervening in it and sustaining a persona God or 'gods', why would 'gods' be describing the Christian deity? They aren't simply describing the Christian deity they are describing deities in general. A god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion): ""a deity of ancient Greece That is the definition of Deity. If you wan to use definitions like I originally tried to neglect, Chronos, the Roman deity of time is by definition a god. Whom if you believe in makes you a theist."	Actually, Greek. Saturn is the Roman one. My point is that you can an atheist but still be theist.	2

Well I learned to be respectful because in my previous posts or arguments I was really rude to people and saying obnoxious things to people and I remember getting tons of down-votes for that and now I look at my posts now it seems that I have matured and my knowledge and logic increased as I have been on this site a lot.  Now I think before I post things and make sure what I am saying is right to say and not rude but kind and respectful of others and I think about my opinions and what my beliefs say about it as well.	This. I do remember when there was masses of hate campaigns on you, for little to no reason. The way that you've matured to deal with that is quite astounding, especially seeing as you get a lot of stick for your beliefs.	2

"Rattle my cage thewayitis? I didn't' realize you had a hidden camera in my home and could tell my emotions... perhaps create debate should have emoticons so you will not be confused as to my emotions, they look something like this ._. - as in ""is this guy for real?"" As for changing the premise, I did not. It's quite evident in fact if you read my argument that I am indeed replying accidentally to two different people at once, then you will see on the other side I addressed the question in a more focused manner. Anyway, you seem to think you know a lot of stuff. You have the answers, you know ""the way it is"" already, but when one bothers to explore the logic of your statements they will find them baseless. You make wide claims that sound nice. Case in point: ""all definitions of religion should be taken into consideration. Arguments should be directed to both meanings of the word, your meaning is no better than the definition that I put forth. It is only equal to it."" Okay, it sounds inclusive and sensible. But just a little thought and one finds it's pure silliness. Everyone does things in such a way that we would call it ""religiously"" you take the next step and call that religious, when in fact ""religiously"" in this context simply means often or regularly. In spite of the similarities of the two words, they are very very different. But you go on to describe how then everyone must be ""religious"" because they do things ""religiously."" I mean, it's basically 3rd grade thinking you dress-up in a 10th writing level... okay 12th grade, maybe that's what annoys me further. I would dislike you less if you just said it like this: ""Like but... if like you do stuff um religiously, then like that's like you're religion and um, you should think about that because it's deep... and stuff"" Now, I actually began reading and I was giving you the benefit of the doubt because I believed you must be making some deeper point, for instance, even if you don't believe in any diety, something in your life will take it's place, whether work, family, or some negative thing. To which I would still argue you are incorrect, and that religion is just a decoration, but it became apparent at least to me that indeed unfortunately you were trying to make this ""religiously v religious"" argument. So I called you out on it. I assure you if I had a cage, it would not have rattled a bit."	One word: Owned.	2

Because Universal Health Care is specifically a theoretical approach to providing health care and has its main implications in economics. Abortion is specifically a theological issue and has its main implication is in metaphysics and the existence of the soul. Social Conservatism just doesn't really say anything on Universal Health Care and why should it? Now, I said that I believed Christian Marxist Socialism is a logical conclusion of a careful reading of the bible. The difference is that this is a much more contentious subject and Christian Socialism was never, on the whole, a doctrine adopted by the church nor one that is ever explicitly expressed in the canonical scripture.	Well, UHC has been cast as merely a policy. Abortion too is a policy, but it has theological aspects. UHC is not principally an economic issue - it's a moral one. UHC too could win moral if not theological appeal if it were properly spinned. Helping 47 million gain access to better health certainly isn't an evil thing. And how isn't caring for the health of others not too a matter of one's soul and existence? True, social conservatives say little now about UHC. They should certainly say something about UHC, if they are opposed to it or willing to vote against it. Shouldn't one's belief in God's omnibenevolence lead a social conservative to believe that UHC would be a policy that would fit within their beliefs? Setting aside taxes (and that's admittedly a tall order), why is there a knee jerk reaction amongst Republicans against UHC? More broadly, if the GOP is truly the party of social values, why do they consistently pledge to cut social programs?  Taxes suck. I get it. But taxing the rich wouldn't offset their lifestyles. They will still have more than everyone else. And if the preponderant financial burden is not on the middle and lower classes, then taxes don't really affect them. Having access to affordable health care would.	2

Humans have never yet succeed in making life - a life with consciousness.  (I don't know if they have succeed in making plant life and stuff - do you know? I mean, you can buy seeds in a grocery store - but is it man-made or natural?) But whatever - as I said, life is the one thing scientists have yet to accomplish. Even though there is a possibility that life CAN be made (I doubt this though), I believe that creating life is something really powerful. I mean, I think its interesting to learn about the human body, how it is made - how the universe is made and all the different elementals combining, and making new substances. But what amazes me the most is life itself. The fact that I am present (This is really hard for me to explain :p) That I am aware of everything going around me .. I just think its remarkable. And to think that God made life - I think that is just as crazy, as believing big bang created life.	We're getting close to successfully creating a healthy clone of a human being, if that counts.	2
What the hell is a trolley ?	You Americans have a different word for trolley? You people really need to learn proper English. Anyway, it is the device used to put products in when shopping.

I up-voted you because that is a tough act to follow in terms of spouting nonsense. But I'll have a go at saying something just as meaningless... What something is depends on whether or not that something can be determined to have qualities not separate from what is being supposed in the earlier statement which only proves that the probability of any given possibility is affected by neither what it has become or someones opinion about it.	I'm not spouting nonsense :( just my opinion lol, I just think differently.	2
The President can invade a Nation, but he can not go to war for this long without Congresses approval. 90 days is the longest a President can sent troops into a Nation without Congress's Approval, we have now been in this war for... what 5 years. Seems to me like you should be planning other people. The President can't really do much at all. He doesn't even get to see most bills until they have been watered down with pork.	You are correct. The President can invade the a nation but only under the War Powers Resolution Act 1973 [1]	2

He was a Christian in his youth but he turned away from the faith and if he was a Christian then why did he kill millions of Jews? Christians are supposed to be respectful of the Jews because they believe in same God we do.	Agreed. :(	2
Yes. There are two rational arguments for this possibility. 1) It is possible that everything exists, .'. every eventuality will come to pass, including flying pigs and spaghetti monsters. 2) Deities, should they exist, are shown to crave power and create cults to worship them. I am sure cultless deities would adopt a man made cult in no time. Haha cultless, cutlass... no, not really.	"I don't know about 1. But there is something crazy about 2 that I like. It sounds so insane it just might be true. I like the idea that Gods are ""made up"" by humans because the actual God got the power to come down and get written down."	2

"I don't think that Puerto Rico should become the 51st for many reasons. One, Puerto Rico has already voted three times to stay a commonwealth meaning that the people do not want to join the United States. We shouldn't force people of a separate culture to join if they have been against it three times already. Two, by the U.S. gaining Puerto Rico as a state it could seem as though we are slowly trying to gain control of the spanish countries or could even seem like we're trying to gain more land. Although it would be a matter of opinion, making Puerto Rico a country could pose a negative reaction among other spanish countries and force them to feel threatened that ""they're next"". The U.S. is already on the bad side of many and we wouldn't want to make it worse. Third, Puerto Rico has a separate, diverse culture than that of the United States. The people there may feel threatened that we would subdue their culture and force them to reform, I'm not saying that we would, but there is a likely chance that they will be treated as though they either ""conform or get out "". Although the U.S. has been considered a ""melting pot"" of cultures, there are so many people who try to cover those cultures and conform to the ""normality"" of the mass in order to fit in. I also don't think native Puerto Ricans will be for becoming a state because they have a good deal; they are aided by the U.S. but they don't have to pay taxes. Sounds like a good deal to me."	I agree strongly with this statement, it would seem as if the United States were seeking more ground for expansion or you can say power hungry if you will. The country is afraid of being viewed as an enemy and this will strengthen their fear.	2

No, eugenics are not ethical. Forcing sterility upon anyone sounds completely asinine. I'd like to hear why exactly this act would not be unethical. And take into consideration that morals and values are a product of our cultural evolution. If they were not meant to be what's best for us to advance ourselves, they would not exist.	 And take into consideration that morals and values are a product of our cultural evolution. If they were not meant to be what's best for us to advance ourselves, they would not exist.  Culture is not an inherent human universal, and is not intrinsically derived from human nature. This is why human cultures vary widely, while certain universals (e.g. facial expressions) are consistent across cultures. Values are not evolutionary so much as they are developed. That being said, they change either way. Neither evolution nor development are static; they change based upon the pressures of our environment - meaning that outdated morality/ethics/values can change as well.	2
I have every right this is my opinion who are you to question it?	"I am not saying it is morally wrong to have belief in religion, I assumed when the debate said ""right"" it meant logical or correct. Personally I think you have every right to believe whatever you want, and should not be morally judged for it as far as I am concerned. However I think whatever it is you believe, there is nothing wrong with logical criticism towards theological, spiritual, or religious beliefs, just as there is nothing wrong with criticizing philosophical ideals and views, scientific hypothesis and theories, political stances, etc."	2

I, personally, have absolutly nothing to apoligise for. And to be quite frank I find the idea of us apoligising for deeds commited hundreds of years ago extremely conceited.	"I agree. Even if you look at the concept of ""slavery"" in America, you'll see that slavery was banned in the Northwest Territories in 1787, and the influx of slaves from Africa, the international slave trade, was banned January 1st, 1808 [in America]. Despite this, slavery remained and even flourished, with the number of slaves increasing between this time period and the Civil War more than five decades later. This is because the quality of life of Black slaves, despite being poor and enduring constant physical abuse, was comparatively higher than that of the average African. This was because many slave owners invested large amounts of money in their slaves and felt their lives should be long enough at least to procreate, but also because it was easier and cheaper to expose a slave to cheap Western medicine than it was to buy a new slave. Not only that, but what are reparations really for? Is it because the descendants of slaves are living in poverty, or simply that they are descendants of slaves? While there needs to be more proactive programs to help the poor in America [not just poor of a specific skin color], that do more than simply hand out cheques and create dependencies, is necessary to keep in mind that slavery in Africa existed long before westerners came to Africa for slaves in 1619, and exists to the present day. By transporting poor, black men and women from Africa, they effectively gave these people's descendants a break from slavery, and exposed them to the greater freedoms and personal liberties available in America. The reparations of slavery have been paid in full -- a break from the long-existing cycle of slavery in Africa, a chance for free education and health care in America, greater personal freedoms, and living in a country that has been free of civil and domestic wars for nearly 150 years."	2
You copied my topic. That is so insanely not cool.  But Non-Christians do.  Thanks a lot buddy...

"Your use of the word ""apparently"" puts me off. What is your source for all of this? If it's just that video then there isn't enough evidence to draw a conclusion. Anyone can fake a story, if it makes the press money, they don't care whether it's true or not."	but thats the thing, it was huge in the press, an then it just died off, seems a little suspicious	2
"Not like the run of the mill perspective debate. The kind of ""why do they hate me"" or ""F*ck you guys I'm a (insert religion here)"" debates. Should those be left out?"	"Ok, i see what you mean by your example debates.  It is a tough decision because i do not want to make anybody feel bad by saying their debates are pointless.  However, that is how i see those debates: pointless, spam, and just ugh.  I do think if someone has a problem, it should be fixed. Why? Because we are a family. :) I do think the ""why do you hate me"" debate should be handled personally and not in public. Maybe a private debate or maybe in personal messaging in which i prefer it should be.  And i do think ""F-ck you guys, I'm a (insert religion here)"" shouldn't be made into a debate because i believe the intent of the author wasn't to debate at all but to state a clear message. I am having trouble with this a little because lets say a author created a debate and needed help to decide which religion is better for the author. And i think that would be an interesting debate. For example: ""I am switching from Christianity from Judaism, is this a good switch."" I guess what i am saying is ""F-ck you guys i'm a (insert religion here)"" has potential to be a great debate. But it looks like the intent of the author wasn't to do that and thus, it shouldn't be created.  So basically, overall, i say it needs to stop in public and needs to resolve in private. .... unless everybody wants it to be public in which i doubt."	2
I have had it with everyone! I hope I die in my sleep! I try my God damnedest to earn people's love but they do not fucking care! Seriously, pray that I die!	What? Don't talk like that. I care. I greatly care. I would roll the earth flat and use it to cover you and protect you from harm. I care.	2

Corruption and playing politics are unfortunately intertwined, so it is impossible to separate these two terms akin to <a href='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/05/cables.article.jpg'>untangling cords.  Playing politics basically means that decisions are made for personal or party gain, which incites corruption. Therefore, in order to play politics, one has to be corrupt. AG Eric Holder is corrupt due to playing politics with the Fast and Furious fiasco. Withholding information is corruption due to playing politics because disclosing that information would be devastating to a campaign.	Any politician who is unwilling to disclose pertinent information is corrupt, and apparently Eric Holder fits the bill.	2
I don't understand how you didn't realise that was what I said in the first place...	Because the way you originally put it didn't tell how it was in preparation of becoming impoverished it was just a statement of how if you were in that shoes you'd want people to help. Which is empathy and it's a moral reason.	2
Eugenics in an extreme sense, is unethical because it is a form of discrimination with a harsh consequence of certain people being forced out of living freely, having a family with children, and looked down upon by society.  For those people who endorse eugenics because it 'promotes' the human race, I think you are wrong for the following reason. One of the things that separates us from other species on this planet, is our caring and sympathetic nature, and the way we treat every being equally regardless of their genetic traits. If we make ourselves into a discriminatory system whereby we select and eliminate certain kinds of people, we are heading for a disturbing path.	 One of the things that separates us from other species on this planet, is our caring and sympathetic nature, and the way we treat every being equally regardless of their genetic traits.  Definitively not true. Other species have been clearly evidenced to display compassion and sympathy, as well as grief and other emotions. This is not at all a unique human quality. What separates us is a capacity for higher cognition, self-reflection, and self-awareness.  If we make ourselves into a discriminatory system whereby we select and eliminate certain kinds of people, we are heading for a disturbing path.  We are already a discriminatory system, and individuals are routinely persecuted for their genetic characteristics. Whether it is a physical or mental disability, something such as human sexuality, or skin or hair color, there are marked disadvantages for certain genetic traits within every society. Selection and elimination already happens, it is just less explicit which makes it more palatable to those who do not experience that discrimination.	2

Yes well then if the man dose not wish to be in the baby's life then he may forfeit his say in the matter but why would a women who payed for artificial insimination be considering abortion in the first place?	"Well it's just the fact that he can leave and she can not, So abortion is her 'leaving'. She wouldn't abort an artificially inseminated child because that's taking an active initiative to have a child. other times accidents happen, and when they do any man has no physical tie to the woman or the fetus so he should have no say over abortion. If you look at it from the perspective of him saying ""Keep the baby, I want a child"" it's all well and good because he's staying to watch over the child, but it gets bad when you see that she has to 'watch' over the child for around 9 months, she has no choice in the matter. Then if you look at it from the side of him saying ""Abort the damn thing."" it's again okay because he's saying that he wants no part in it, but again it's bad because he is saying to abort because he wants to stay with her without a child. I understand pretty well the point you and others who say he should have a word are making. It's his child. If he told her to abort it it'd be messed up and people would fling to the fact that it's her child, yet how come when she gets an abortion because she wants to it's not the same thing? I say it's not because of the level of attachment that is there."	2

How can one say that Christians are too close minded when it is atheists that say there is no possibility that God could exist? One can not be anymore closed minded than that. Christians on the other hand believe it to be possible that God exists and act upon this assertion.	"Assuming the Christian and the atheist were both certain in their belief (LittleMisfit put up a good scale for atheists and theists who are less than sure) both are close minded to the same number of things. The atheist denies all gods, one more so than the Christian, who denies 99.99% of the gods throughout history but not his own god. So the Christian is more open than the atheist in this regard. Except that the Christian is also close minded to the possibility that there is no god, something the atheist obviously isn't close minded to.  The Christian denies all gods but one, which is more open than the atheist, but they also deny the possibility there is no god, which is less open minded than the atheist.  The atheist denies all gods including the Christian one, making him .01% more close minded than the Christian, but he's also open to the possibility that there isn't a god, something the Christian is closed to, making the atheist more open in that regard.  Overall both groups deny the same number of things conceptually. And compared to a belief system like agnosticism that denies nothing and says ""i don't know"" both systems are incredibly close minded."	2
What beliefs somebody has doesn't matter. What does matter is when one's belief is as self-righteous as some of the atheist here, the difference between them and the religious extremist is none. Al qaida with a different name. An extremist is an extremist.	I don't disagree with that !	2

There are high funcktoning stoners nad low fucktoning tsoners. I'm a hgih funktioning stoner!1!1!!	I can definitely tell you're a high functioning stoner due to the sheer amount of excessive grammatical mistakes. Congrats.	2
And that's a great attitude to have :). .	Thank you sweetheart. My mantra is this: One must question everything, even God Himself.	2
Well, duh... but who is more corrupt?	Which ever one is in office, because that is when they start getting bribes. 	2
Not as creepy as this... it still gives me nightmares... uh.	I think this video would be good for spamming and scarring... But it makes me so uncomfortable for some reason.	2
With these policies, 99% of the land were collectives, causing the production increased. More new modern equipment and chemicals are build and found. Thus, Stalin's policies able the Russian to have better live.	"HAHAHAHAHAHA, Your english is fabulous. Directly quoting ""Stalin's policies able the Russian to have better live."" Grammar used here is fantastic."	2
"I saw this same picture, but the caption said: ""I put the STD in Stud, now all I need is U."" As for why I'm on this side, I don't believe my own wedding was gay, unless you mean happy. ;)"	Are you saying that your wedding was NOT all romantic and sappy with symbols of a princes and her knight in shinning armor? Did you get married by the justice of the peace? I'm just asking ;)	2
"I take it you never played, ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours."" Well..., it's your turn. ;)"	I'm confused already! Is it Sunday yet? On the bright side you'll be getting lots of nasty replies from a certain sitar playing someone! :))	2
Maybe so. Do your parents have a hard time affording things because of taxes?	It doesn't seem that way, we have council tax which is quite expensive, for all local services. You only have to pay council tax if you own a house (we do), and it depends on the classification of your house how much you pay (ours is tiny).  <a href='http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_and_housing/council_tax/council_tax_banding.aspx'>http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council                                        taxandhousing/counciltax/counciltaxbanding.aspx There is also income tax at about 20% <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom#Income_tax'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaxationintheUnitedKingdom#Incometax That's all the personal taxes, apart from inheritance tax and value added tax (20% vat on expensive/luxury items).	2
Do you know what a marriage is under the law? Oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. They are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if I had two identical roses and called them Joe and Sam, they're still both the same rose.	They are the same thing under law, yet under law they still managed to exclude homosexual couples. The name in the fine print is not that relevant when the title you put on potentially a resume, a facebook status update, or anywhere you may need it is different. When an employer is going through the list of people who could be hired, their personal opinion comes into play when the requirements are equally met by maybe two or more people. A homophobic employer will always pick the Married man over the man in a Legal Union.	2
If he were a freedom fighter then the majority of Muslims would embrace him. There are no Muslim country where the majority embrace him. The country that embraced him was Afghanistan but there a minority group was in power and they were the ones doing the embracing.... and look at what happened to them ;)	I agree, Joe and well put! He may be looked at as a freedom fighter by his rag-tag group of fundamentalist fanatics but that would be the extent of it. He is a terrorist...pure and simple!	2
And the Crocodilians (Crocodiles and Alligators)  	Crocodilians are not dinosaurs. They are their second closest living relatives though.	2
Well, if something were to happen that would prevent the U.S. from waging war (like..., the U.S. going bankrupt, for example) then they may go for it. I think that it is a possibility that we will go bankrupt if we keep on printing money and bailing companies out.	This could be a possibility, we have to stop bailing out companies. But the US would not be prevented from waging war. If you have weapons you need not purchase them =]	2
Well, I can't. You didn't provide a link. Personally, I moved on from Mussorgsky to Stravinsky at age 16 and never looked back. I listened to the Rite of Spring every night while falling to sleep for a year. I even have the two piano performance of it, and can recreate the orchestration in my head.	I didn't get any of this. I mean, they don't dance like Michael Jackson and there are no fast video cuts, no lyrics, no half naked women..... I'm so confused ;)	2
In the UK the parents would probably be prosecuted for failing to take care of their child.	Among'st many other things..!	2
I also Pwned you when I brought up the fact that Obamacare cuts $127 billion from the deficit which I had gotten the article from the completely bipartisan CBO company. I don't know where you got the $2 trillion number but It was probably from a conservative leaning source.	CBO keeps changing the price tag for Obamacare. The total cost was originally determined to be about $900 billion over the first decade, now they think it will cost around $1.8 Trillion. That is double what they originally thought.	2
"War is itself is an evil War does not kill evils; war is itself an evil and a mother of many other evils like massive destructions, unemployment, mental and physical diseases, poverty, economic instability, illiteracy. It has destroyed nations from the face of earth.  What is war? War is a reciprocated, armed conflict, between two or more non-congruous entities, aimed at reorganizing a subjectively designed, geo-politically desired result.  The term is also used for non-military conflict, such as in the example of cold war.  The history of man has seen these wars.Afghan war, American Civil War, World war 1, World War 2, Napoleon War, Kuwait war, Iran-Iraq war etc  In history, no war brought the wellness of human being, it pushed the society behind.  Personally I am against war as the very act of fighting among each other divides us as a race. With more divisions, and with that, more bad blood between people, misunderstandings among people of different groups, be they racial, national and religious, will increase exponentially.  The history of war is as old as human. There could be so many reasons of going war. The  Also, war takes lives. Not only of enemies also of our brothers. I hope that I will never have to see even once in my lifetime. In World War II, it is estimated that 60 to 70 Million causalities occurred. War  Not to mention, war exerts a tremendous strain on the country's economy. If you dont have a comparative advantage in making weapons, then your resources will not be used efficiently, and people in your own country are going to suffer, if not in the battlefields of soldiers, then in the battlefields of their own house, where they fight for survival from hunger.  We teach our kids that they shouldn't fight with their little friends over toys, food, etc. Instead, they should talk and reach a consensus. ""If your little friend keeps hitting you, ignore him, or talk to him, but never fight back, because then the problem will never be solved.""  We should now teach adults that war doesn't solve problems, and is bad both to winners and losers. To reply anger with anger is not intellectual.  War breeds destruction not just to mankind and infrastructure but also to the environment, from massive deforestation to air pollution.  Chemical agents pollute the sea, air and land, destroying a large number of habitats and killing off its inhabitants.  Biological weapons cause damages to large areas and it is danger enough that If go out of control can affect the population around the globe.  Yes, it is true that we have to fight to save people's life however, have you thought about the long term effects that could happen by waging war and using force to help those people?  I think war is a manly way to solve problems, but not the best way. I really don't see how it overall benefits anything.  War is a tool of illiterate and non civilized persons. Civilized nation who have understood the value of peace are progressing rapidly like European countries. It is quite evident that they are the fastest progressing countries. While in Asia where most of the third world countries exist, the main reason of their poverty is the on going conflicts among the people of countries themselves and with the neighboring countries.  Look around yourself and observe people. You will find that the person who remains angry and ever ready to go on a fight always remain surrounded by problems. All his efforts end in multiplying the problem. He causes damages not only to himself but also to his relatives and nearby people. On the other hand, a person who avoids conflicts or try to solve conflicts with in soft manner actually resolve them. This brings harmony among people.  War kills innocent people.  Wars Risk the Future of the Human Race  War is an aggression  Life is sacred.  The history of the world comprises a number of wars  In war, no one wins, both are in loss.  : war! war! Why do we have to fight? People are dieing because of the war, War is not good, absolutely nothing. Death here, death there, Parents are lost, dreams are lost, Children are lost, brightness is lost. War brings darkness, War destroys happiness, War brings GENOCIDE. War overtakes peace, And replaces it with conflict, War is not harmony. War brings greediness, War brings depression, War is not good, absolutely nothing."	^ ^ | | | | Agree with that. War is bad.-------------------------	2
I think it is some kind of treason because with this, we dont experience freedom and democracy. Criminals, dont have the right to reason out or even appear before a judge, well, mostly, some of the accused are not really the real ones who did those crimes and just accused of it.	What do u think the next logical step would be for the American people?	2
But I have plus twelve tenacity and plus seven persuasiveness.	Well your shits still weak brah. . You'll have to call for some back up for this level. It's unsoloable.	2
"""there is no other way besides God."" I'm an agnostic theist, so I haven't said that ever. I believe everything is possible, but no matter what I believe - no God, a God, several Gods .. everything is magic no matter what I believe."	"Well, if you said ""everything is amazing/beautiful/incredible no matter what I believe"" but I would support you more, because life is all of those things no matter how you believe it came to be. But magic has a specific connotation. It implies supernatural occurrence. Your claiming atheism is therefore more supernatural, when those of us atheists who are using science to support our claims are doing pretty much the exact opposite of citing supernatural explanations."	2
Thank you for clarifying. It still means God does the condemning, not Satan.  Hell is the punishment after God has condemned someone to that fate.	"That is correct. He does. No denying that. But God has done everything he can to try to make this NOT happen. Think about it this way. You're driving along a road that you know has a 45 mph speed limit. You know it does but you still go 75 mph and end up in a head on collusion with a guy killing him and you survive somehow. You go to court and the judge is their and its the guys father. He has to charge you and he does but then the brother of the guy walks in says he'll take the charges for you, all you have to do is say yes and take a safe driving course. You yell out ""F--- no!"" And even go on complaining how the 45 mph sign should've really been a 75 mph sign. I hope you can see the analogy."	2
What's funny is I think this is beginning to sound like conservative bias! If she wins, which I don't think she will. I already told you that I am not conservative. I'm trying to convince you to be unbiased. If you were a conservative trash-talking all liberals, then I'd still be arguing with you. I don't think Clinton will win. I never said that I don't want her to win... even though I don't. the Republicans have nowhere to go in 2016 unless they get somebody like Rubio to oppose somebody other than Clinton. Obama's final term will be the deciding factor. So far it doesn't look good for the Democrat's.   Also if Bill won I don't see how his wife can't I never said she can't, I just don't think she will. If she does win, it won't be because of who her husband is. As for my thoughts on Obama As I had said before Obama was a disappointment but he still did great things for the country, the affordable health care act was passed under him making him the first president to pass a law for universal health care. Obamacare is a bunch of shit. It's cons outweigh it's pros. He ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama Bin Laden. The war wasn't with Iraq, it's with Al Qaeda. We no longer have a military presence in Iraq, but we're still in the Middle East. Turn on the news, we're going to war with Syria! So now we are not only at war with Al Qaeda... but Syria as well. He didn't end a war, he added one. And he passed the dream act. Education for illegal immigrants? Yeah, that was real important... The debt is beginning to drip as well. The debt has increased by more than $6 Trillion dollars since he took office his second term. It is the largest debt increase under any President.	Education for illegal immigrants? Yeah, that was real important... I plan to be an immigrant, (I'd rather not say whether it is legal or illegal here), I resent that a little. To be honest though, the dream act can have a lot of practicalities. But you are right, the only thing Barack has going for him is that he is black and does whatever the people want him to do.... passing laws that will get him votes. He is not very impressive.	2
Sorry i have a life. Also its the quality of your arguments when youre on that matters. Not the quanitity of them. I do check it to see if i get disputed but nobody ever does (cuz i win). Also the new debates that are up are 90% stupid and pointless. My area of expertise is science and religion and those are disappearing	Sorry i have a life Can I borrow it sometime? I really have nothing to do.	2

Yeah it really is. I prefer harry potter, the plot is much more exciting and the whole series itself is just so much more creative than Twilight.	it IS! -_- just accept it! read the books.! and watch the movies. you'll love it! why'd you think we have fangirls all over the world!	2
Also evolution is supposed to be banned from teaching in Texas and 10 other states by 2030 by their states constitution and replace it with the literal reading of the book of genesis do you support that? I highly doubt it, and if so, then I lose hope in humanity.  Also by 2030 3/4 of Americans and 3/5 of Europeans will support evolution being banned what would you do when it happens? You have statistics to back that up? If that really is the case I'm going to have to cry over ignorance taking us over. If it turned out that evolution really started to become so unpopular that doesn't mean anything on whether or not it is valid. Truth isn't a democracy, truth will be whether we believe in the truth or not.	I am going to find the article but most of my friends don't believe inevolution.	2
It's a big time war causer. I've seen marriages fall apart because of religious differences. Friendships end as well. So it's just not big wars, little wars are just as bad.	Agreed. Most religion is bad. .	2
Seriously? What are you doing? If you are not going to try to be funny, how am I going to keep going. The article says that people either turn away - me saying whatever, or literally saying I was looking away from my computer. Or, challenging the sources - me saying who has ever heard of the website you mentioned. Or, the person will fail to see the point - me saying that your examples don't apply and literally asking what your point is.  Come on man. At least say something funny.

School shootings (like most mass murders) are spontaneous. They come from troubled teens and young adults who decide to outlet by killing many innocents and then finally offing themselves. It's practically impossible to prevent a school shooting.	If school shootings are partially impossible to prevent, then why before 1966 there were no school shootings ever reported. Well, before 1966, government's monopoly of education was non-existent, and schools and teachers had much more control over the behavior of students on the campus and in the classroom. Trouble teenagers and young adults are directly related to the lack of discipline implemented by parents and teachers. Therefore, bullying ensues.	2
How is it that the other side's score is 19? This scoring stuff is really messed up.	Dana and her other account spammed. 	2

I disagree with this i drove myself at 12 just down the street because my farther was teaching me how to drive as long as you know how to steer,you can push the peedle , and you can take directions it shouldn't be that hard If you disagreed with it, then I would have liked a rebuttal to my arguments, which was not provided. The fact is, even though you may think you're a responsible driver at 14 for driving down a road, there's a lot you have to learn before being able to drive. I'm assuming you didn't use turn signals, or lane indicators? The fact of the matter is, you would be a serious hazard on a highway. You don't have the experience to be driving at 14, which is why you need to be older to drive. So yes 14 year olds should be able to drive. You just have to know what your doing. Because you drove up a street means 14 year olds should be able to drive? In all likelihood, the chance of a 14-year old passing a driver's test and getting a license is slim to none without serious practice. The age restrictions are there for reasons which I have provided. Yes ; every body recks even 30 year old , mature adults reck to Yes, adults also cause car crashes, however like I said, the chances of a 14-year old crashing is much higher than, say, a 25 year old. There are too many distractions in a child's mind that could occur at any time, too many tight situations (parking would be a nightmare), and overall it is just a big waste of time for such a small result.	I did use turn signals and i went test driving yesterday with my farther ; and i stopped at lights,stop signs,i slowed down on turns and everything iam very responsiable i have been helping my mother , with my sisters for 6 years SO DONT TELL ME I AM NOT RESPONSIABLE and if i chose to have a baby at this age ; i would be ready to be a mother but like i said in my other debate i got other tjhings to worry about	2
Damn! This is a tough choice but I will go with Indian... mainly because Indian is newer to me so I haven't been eating it as long but I still wish they'd through some beef around in there every now and then.	believing too much in god is too good??? seating in home and praying god will pay you more or will run your family????	2
Most of you guys think that women can't do anything good in life. well for your information we can. and we do. especially in your lives. -cooking -cleaning -taking care of children - working -different sports -chouffer... NEED I SAY MORE???  she would make an awesome VP. she can't control what her daughter did and so what if her daughter is having a child. maybe they don't have that great of a relationship due to palin being a public official. suck it up and let the women do a mans job for once..	"I bet this guy blames Ronald Reagan having a job for having a gay child too. Maybe John John died in a plane crash because his father was president some 40 years earlier and wasn't there for him? I am not for banning books but it sure beats a president who wants to create a national civilian defense force as large and equally well funded as our military. Which one is more scary to you? She might be a great vice president. She might not be. But it won't have anything to do with the fact that she is a woman. All I know is she has a 65% approval rating in her state and the Congress that the three guys came from is barely in double digits. Compare that with this guy and Brooke Hogan who thinks a woman can't run the country because of how moody and hormonal they get. Yup she said it and obviously this guy agrees. I am soooo ready to take my political lead from a ""Reality star""."	2

"Your vow to not reply was so much more impressive before you replied. Mentioning a religious holiday is innately broaching religion, and discussion at places I've worked has been more extensive. I am glad we can agree that that is inappropriate, but the reality is that the sheer prevalence of Christianity and the blind privilege of many of its practitioners is precisely why that happens. As far as Christmas also being cultural, that does not divorce it from its primarily Christian foundation. Asking everyone their religious views was your suggestion, and not my initial argument at all. I was responding to when you asked me if you should personally ask me my religious views. I personally would prefer that, and so I answered in the affirmative. I do not find it awkward to have genuine conversations in place of superficial interactions. I recognize that I am something of an aberration in that respect, which is why I also observed that one could simply not wish a total stranger a happy religious holiday. I never said that social interaction was zero sum. That was actually rather my point. If you are engaging with other people you should probably give some actual consideration to whatever it is that you are saying. My argument has been that this should involve checking ones privilege and not being insensitive about it. If you are just interacting to satisfy your personal feelings of ""good will"" then you really do not give a shit about the other person. ""Hello"" is still superficial, but it is not equitable to a greeting associated with hundreds of years of oppression and discrimination. You asserted my (out)rage to begin with, and when I pointed out that I have not become emotional to any notable extent at all on this issue you just dropped it. Now you claim you didn't address it, as if it were my idea. Please.  I hardly see how asking people not to say something insensitive is much of an imposition, let alone impractical. I do not go around wishing people happy atheist day; I never found that especially taxing. There are plenty of other ""social lubricants"" (like the good old, ""have a nice day"") which are considerably less insensitive and at least equally effective. There is really no good reason to wish me a Merry Christmas, and there is at least one good reason (as yet honestly non-refuted) not to do so."	Quite right, I had forgotten not to continue for the last word. Note that this is not a dispute.	2

is it my fault i can't speak, or that my body becomes weak.. or that i can hardly move at the very thought of you? nothing ever really got to me; i could always turn the other cheek. could it be those days are gone ? could've sworn that i was strong at least stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions but they're taking over me no no no no this can't be it; the less you are the less she is. no no no no 'cause i can usually handle this; its just i wasn't ready for these. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions, but they're taking over me. you're the silence in a roaring crowd; you're the equivalent of a fluffy cloud; a genie in a bottle: make a wish to wish the wishes will never end. you're the platinum in my treasure chest. you're the answer that i never woulda guessed. i'm a love life test and i don't mind at all; i don't mind at all. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions, but they're taking over me.

Personally I look at someone shoes to get the first impression. Dirty or oil stained shoes can mean a hard worker. Fancy dress shoes usually means that they means business. But on here, I cannot see your shoes so I make up for it by your grammar.	There are several things you can look at on a person to form an impression. Shoes is a new one for me, because I usually look at the outfit whole. But I see your point	2

I believe that friendship between man and woman exists. I have some friends, who are girls. However it is not like the friendship between men. Friendship between men can exist for whole life, while friendship between man and woman can be just temporarily. The most of people can say that true friendship should be just for whole life. Temporarily friendship is not the friendship at all. Nevertheless, I think that everything depends on honesty and sincerity. If the friendship was for a little time but with honesty and sincerity, then it is real friendship.	"I agree with you, but what do you mean by ""temporarily""? Temporarily, while one of them find boyfriend( girlfriend)? Or another reasons? Why friendship between man and woman can not be forever?"	2

I wasn't being racist or anything. =/	I also can' t believe that they didn't argue against you, the only reason for downvoting you would have been because they either dislike you personally or prefered the other side of the debate.	2

Yes but still.  A homosexual is a person who sexually and emotionally favors the opposite sex. You can say a woman is homosexual. You cannot say a woman is gay, nor can you say a man is a lesbian.	Yes you can say a man is a lesbian! It just wouldn't be correct. 8D wheeeeee	2
By the way, even they do not have a choice, it does not mean they are unhappy.	You are right. Some of them that do not have a choice are happy. Only the ones that want a choice and the ones that get beat because they got raped are unhappy.	2
There are a lot of people in debt because they tried to buy a house and the market collapsed. There are tons of people who are in debt because they never had enough to survive.

There really is no reason to have such a large gun though. Are you trying to stop an elephant, or a tank? A small accurate handgun like a Walther ppk (the gun my dad used) is much more reasonable.  Now if your paranoid we're going to have a revolution or something then maybe your assault rifle is alright, but I don't see the use.	handguns are not as accurate as rifles. in fact, revolvers are considered mini-rifles because they're the only handguns that have any true accuracy. plus, it's always important to have an equal hand to those out there who will always have access to the most powerful weapons (criminals and the government). plus, a handgun won't stop a line backer on PCP, unless we're talking an semi-automatic magnum.	2

I was just trying to satisfy the burden of proof to you, extrapolating from your example. If you go back and read my last post carefully, i said she was freely able to stop the ATTEMPT at sexual intercourse which you called for so a being could demonstrate a willingness to have sex without being able to communicate verbally.  As to the bit about the dog easily being forced to have sex, i already addressed that in my previous post, where i said is was gonna cut off your next argument. to elaborate just a bit on ""if the owner molested the dog several times and hit him..."" all these things can be done to smaller people by larger people, like my previous point about human to human rape. Some people are terrible, horrific people, i can't dispute this. It is fairly clear when a dog is doing what you want it to because it is afraid of you and when a dog is doing something you want because it loves you and wants to do whatever it is.  I think I have stated my argument as clearly as I can; if I didn't convince you, or if you won't allow yourself to be convinced that's cool. If by chance, you think i was unclear on any of my points, I'm happy to continue this topic. Otherwise i think we are at an impasse and will very shortly, if not already are, going to be going in circles. I thank you for listening to my arguments and considering them based on their logical merit. If you have any other topics you would care to debate with me; i would be happy to let you propose a topic and pick a side and i will take the opposition. I don't know if there is a way to have a private debate on here, but that might be more efficient and not clog up another topic's board."	Yeah okay. I just know that I do not support bestiality, because I don't see how a dog could sign a contract, where he'd agree to stay with his owner for better or for worse. Also, when you are allowed to marry, you are also allowed to divorce. How should a dog ask for a divorce? I mean come on.. there is no direct communication.	2

You know what, you're right. I'm sorry, but I can't keep disagreeing with you. It's totally against protocol, but I'm actually going to recognize that the other side might not be made up of a bunch of retarded monkeys (this is sarcasm, not belligerence). You are absolutely right. I still believe that the fact is, the propaganda and the like is the root cause and it must be eliminated for there to be real change, but you're spot on in saying that those that haven't been corrupted need to take a stand. And while I want to believe there are enough smokers out there that can stay sober long enough to make a distance, the fact is there needs to be more. Stoner apathy is not ubiquitous and it's not the sole cause of the lack of legalization, but it's a problem that if solved could perhaps be a catalyst for change.	I think you should review the definition of sarcasm.  Propaganda surely plays a role in the negative perception that persists around pot. As does Hollywood and the way they present people under the influence. Those who have never tried it may believe that the Hollywood high is the same as a real person would experience, when in truth that is rarely the case (some movies do a good job of presenting being high realistically).  I'm not arguing that stoners are too stoned to make a stand. The point is that they are just not motivated to be politically active for the cause.  I think that if there were a strong grassroots movement, change would certainly follow. There are enough people who don't smoke weed who understand it's not a big deal and the US government is fully aware of the lack of danger.	2

But the point is does religion cause violence, hatred and ignorance? Yes. Does athiesm? No. Yes there have been many killers, dictators and evil deeds commited by both athiest and religious people alike - but does religion in some cases inspire people to slaughter, hate and discriminate? Yes, ofcourse it does. Does athiesm, no. People are quick to point out cases such as Stalin, Hitler etc. when denouncing athiesm as being just as bad as religion in inspiring such things, but Stalin wasn't inspired by athiesm to be such a absolute cunt, he was inspired by ideals such as Marxism, as Hitler was inspired by his vision of a super-race. That is simplyfing things, yes, but it does get to the heart of the problem, which is that a beleif that your serving a God (the true and only God, mind you, your God) can lead to, in extreme cases, terrible atroscities being commited. Can a beleif in a Godless and random universe, combined with nothing else, inspire such things? No.	Pretty much all religions teach people to do good things and avoid violence hatred and ignorance. IF some individuals have an interpretation of their religion that causes them to do evil things it isn't the religion's fault. The individual would have probably done evil anyway because it is in his nature. Religion also motivates lots of people to do good things which atheism doesn't.  And to be honest if you really accept atheism and the laws of Darwinism, you would lack the moral values that push you toward doing good deeds opposed to doing evil deeds. IT is always easier to do evil then to do good. For example if there is a catastrophe and food is scarce, stealing from a hungry neighbor is perfectly acceptable under darwinism. IT is survival of the fittest. If I am stronger and more clever than him I have a right to steal from him and let him die instead of me. You bring Hitler up. IF Hitler really was a christian he wouldn't have killed and tortured all those people because the Bible teaches it is wrong to do so. In the least his christianity would have been a moral obstacle against his evil. Now if he was an athiest not only would his atheism not be an obstacle to doing evil but if he believed in a superior race it would have given him even more of a reason to kill off this inferior race that is consuming resources.(survival of the fittest).  So in conclusion, atheism doesnt directly cause people to do good or evil because it doesnt have a moral element . However as long as the easier and more beneficial (to yourself) path is the evil one which it is in most cases atheism motivates people to take that path.	2

I'm pretty sure your title gives away which side you'd be on if you actually were going to argue this, but from someone who supports the legalization of marijuana and doesn't smoke pot regularly (not at all, even) I can tell you that there are numerous avtivist groups lobbying for the legalization who are committed enough to make a difference (see the recent massachusetts ballot question, my home state! woo, repreSENT!) I plan on being an active member of the SSDP (students for a sensible drug policy) group when I get to college in a few weeks, and for every pot-smoker who is too lazy to give a shit, there are at least 3 who are either active smokers themselves but make time for campaigning, or non-smokers who believe that the criminalization of marijuana is a dumb practice that is based on faulty logic and should be done away with as soon as possible. Don't miss the forest for the trees; or in this case, the plant for the leaves.	"The title comes from the title of Wishnia's essay on the topic. I generally wait a little bit before posting my response to debates I've made.  In this case, I myself am an avid smoker. I completely support legalization, but the only two things I've done towards this cause are to contribute money to NORML and to write my congressman. That's the extent of my involvement, and among my friends who smoke, I'm fairly certain I'm the only one who's even gotten that far.  Although I wish it weren't the case, I think Wishnia's statement is not far off. I'm quite glad to see that the both of the responses have contradicted it, I want there to be more activism in this regard. As the great Bob Marley once said, ""Get up, stand up. Stand up for your rights."""	2
"Here's what I'm more confused about. David Schuster kept on interrupting her... which is good. But, whenever O'Reilly interrupts someone, it's used as ammo by the people on this site to point out that Fox News isn't fair and balanced... interesting. ""LOL, equal airtime means nothing because O'Reilly interrupts!!!!"" Anyway, of course she's a nut. Same thing with these 9/11Truth people... just ideologues who want so badly to attack someone they highly disagree with that they would actually make shit up. and they have DOCUMENTS!!! UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT PROVE EVERYTHING1!1 Right, because the CIA and FBI would just let you get documents like that. with Obama, right, like the entire government is ignoring your ""birth certificate"" because they all love him so much. Face it, your papers don't mean shit because, in fact, they are shit. If the info that you have is so important: 1. The government will use it to get to the bottom of something or 2. The government will make you disappear so that you don't spread it neither has happened, so STFU. Dumbasses, all of them."	Maybe the FBI and CIA missed something with Obama's documents. I mean hes just the president, they probably just gave his papers a quick glance.	2
Puerto Rico is very proud of its Spanish language and culture.Although the island is bilingual, the language of the government, public schools, courts and 80 - 90% of the residents of Puerto Rico is Spanish and around 90% of Puerto Rico's high school graduates do not speak English well. There is a bill that was sent to Congress in 2006. Though the bill has not yet been passed, officials may still again attempt to make English the official language of the United States of America. If this bill and the creation of Puerto Rico as a state were both passed we would be forcing the 4 million new citizens to learn a completely new language.	She is right. Making Puerto Ricans learn the English language when most of them have only known Spanish all their life is more than it's worht. I know that if someone was telling me that the primary language in Texas was going to be Spanish from now on, I wouldn't be very happy. It's not as much have to learn the language(which is difficult in itself) as much as the fact that it takes away from the Puerto Rican culture. As she said, their language is a large part of the Puerto Rican culture and taking away their language could be hurtful to their culture. Not only that but it would be rather difficult and expensive to convert the 'state' to English. Any signs and stores would have to be changed to English. Imagine the expenses on the buisnesses. The amount of money that it would cost simply for a restaurant to change all of their menus to the English language would surely cost financial issues for the small buisnesses. So I agree that we should not make Puerto Rico a state.	2

If I told you you have the freedom of choice on what soda to drink, then its common sense to assume that not wanting to drink soda would be an option. The same goes with freedom of religion. You may practice any religion you want, but you also have the option to not practice any religion at all	"I can support this, at least up to the point where it's used to attack the beliefs of others. The list of things that atheists (not atheists in general, but those who define themselves primarily as atheists, also called 'hard atheists' or 'strong atheists') place under the category of ""forcing religion on me"" has long since crossed the line of ridiculous and into the surreal."	2
1. What is wrong with when one of the three wanting a fourth spouse? 2. What are your thoughts on when three people are married to each other?  - what I mean is polygamy is when you have several spouses, but your spouses don't necessarily have to be married to each other. So what are your thought on three or more people, where everyone is married to everyone?	"1. I don't say that it's wrong but here's the problem as I see it. let's say the fourth person brought in is already married to SIX others.  2. See above. If one people has a right to two spuses of their choice so does everyone else and it might not be the ones they are already married to.  Imagine the domestic disputes on the future ""Cops"" episodes. Grab some popcorn!"	2

why so negative? You said fuck several times with no provocation. Christian and other religious groups come together formally under a leader, they are organized. Atheists don't. A group of atheists that come together to say that religion is stupid isn't the same as a church gathering of people to unite under a belief in god. The theists are coming together because their religious laws dictate it, any atheists that unite are doing that in their free time as something recreational.	"I'm a theist whom does not go to church and so who's leading me? No one, I am leading myself and figuring out what the hell is going on by my self, currently. Sure there was a time when I was younger, however, it's like you're saying no matter if I'm in church or not that I am being ""lead"" by a group of people.  I could say the same to an atheist. They don't go to church, and you claim have ""no leaders', however it's obviously that many atheists look up to and learn a lot from other atheists, whomever they be, thus resulting in atheists having at least SOME form of organization. Atheists aren't running around individually with no agenda in mind, they obviously wish to proclaim to the world that there is in fact no god(s), ever. And so, think of the teachers and the schoolbooks that teach particular things that are not religious and that are atheistic. That is, most atheists believe not in the bible or any other religious texts, but scientific textbooks, seminars, literature, whatever. There is organization written all of it, that is undeniable and don't even try.  Just face it, atheists are organized to a degree, and it's obvious that religion in general, is organized.  Every person falls into a category, we're all a part of the societal organization and cultural entity.  (P.S. Yeah, when I drink I tend to enjoy saying/typing the word ""FUCK"". I can type 80 WPM and when I'm going it just comes out. Don't mind that...)"	2
"Slavery was first of all not supported by God. In Leviticus 25:44-46 god says, ""Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly."" If god doesn't support slavery why did he tell people ""you may buy slaves"" and that they are ""property"" that you can pass down to your children, and that you can make them ""slaves for life"" as long as they are not Israelites? The rules he instituted for slavery only applied to Israelites. God established humane limits on an already evil and cruel system. How about instead of establishing humane limits he tells them to stop making people slaves. It's funny how god has no problem telling people silly things like don't wear mixed fabrics and don't eat shellfish but he doesn't seem to think that slavery is a very important issue. He tells people that the punishment for picking up sticks on the sabbath is death, the punishment for not being a virgin is death, the punishment for cursing at your parents is death, but there is no punishment for owning slaves or beathing your slaves as long as they survive the beating. Doesn't that strike you as a little odd? They were given a day of rest (Ex. 20:10). This wasn't for the benefit of the slave. It was because god considers work on the sabbath unholy and anyone found working on the sabbath was to be put to death. Even if it were for the benefit of the slave does it really make a difference. Is slavery somehow not so bad since they are allowed to rest one day a week? They were to encouraged to attend religious services (DT. 12:12,18;16:11). So not only were they forced into slavery but they also had to grovel to the god who said it was okay for them to be made into slaves in the first place. Why didn't these religious services include the message ""don't own slaves"" instead of ""make sure your slaves attend church with you."" Israelites slaves were to be treated with extra benevolence, being freed after 6 years (Ex. 21:2; DT. 15:12) or in the Year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:40-41). Yes, god plays favorites with the Israelites, which in itself isn't fair, but if you're not an Israelites or are female then it sucks to be you because you can be made a slave for life. Female slaves who become wives to their owners were to be given all respect as a normal wife (Ex. 21:8-11). How come you skipped verse 7? ""If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do."" Why would a benevolent god say it's okay to sell your daugthers as a slave and say that she can be made into a lifetime slave, unlike males who are set free after 6 years? So not only is god okay with slavery, he's also sexist. When a term of slavery ended the slave had to be a gift (DT. 15:13-14). Only for Israelites. All others are slaves for life. If a slave receives excessive physical abuse they are granted freedom (Ex. 21:26-27) and is considered a crime.  Only if they lose an eye or a tooth during the beating and are Hebrew.  Through these measures we see moses, by God, meant slaves were human beings and granted rights by their creator. Again, only for Israelites. Since you used Moses for your example, lets see what else he has to say about slavery. Deuteronomy 20: 10-15 ""When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby."" So not only are people forced into slavery by gods chosen people, the women are considered plunder. So in context I believe the allowed physical abuse is like that of disciplining a child and yes I day and agree this is fair. This isn't just a minor discipline like a spanking a child. It says, “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."" It doesn't say beat them gently like disciplining a child. It says as long as they survive the beating there is nothing wrong with it. It even mentions a rod and recovery time. Do you think something as minor as disciplining a child takes a day or two to recover from?  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFmC6BD1B4'>This video shows just how ridiculous the Biblical god is when it comes to slavery."	It's worse than that. God actually has no problem with beating them to death, so long as they don't die right away: Exodus 21:20-21 New American Standard Bible (NASB) 20 “If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies [a]at his hand, he shall [b]be punished. 21 If, however, he [c]survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his [d]property. Morality without religion? More like morality despite religion.	2

I would say it's about understanding people rather than being right... cause you could be right in saying God does/doesn't exist.. but end of the day if what you say makes no sense or is wrong.. or when you read other people's debates you don't understand what they're saying then it's kinda pointless to argue.	To have a debate 'controversy' is necessary; there must be a conflict of interest or/and a difference of opinion between two or more sides. In academic debate, understanding, learning and knowledge are important. One side has to take on the 'burden of proof' to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt! That side is the affirmative side in academic debate. Debating is not an easy thing to participate in; you have to be very aware of issues and to have a way of putting you argument across succinctly with economy of expression so that the audience and the judges can follow your train of thought; whether it is deductive or inductive reasoning that your using.  Beware of those who create fallacies to draw you into an erroneous conclusion to an argument.	2

"I would have to say home school because then children aren't exposed to the bad behavior I've dealt with in school and it would be specialized. Education isn't simply an academic process. Its pedagogy entails the proper raising of ""good citizens"" - in whatever manner that is defined. That education requires that people aren't raised to be naive: that they encountered wonders and villainy, have screwed up, and simply done all the correspondingly stupid nonsense that we normally associate with youth while they're actually young, can be protected and guided as properly as possible, inasmuch as anyone can. And having screwed up,and done all the correspondingly stupid things that we normally associate with youth, they can grow up. But growing requires those kinds of experiences: digesting and ultimately surmounting them. Keeping children away from ""bad behavior"" often does leave them unprepared for an adulthood that will see them absolutely inundated with that kind of behavior at almost every turn. There's a reason why little girls who are overprotected by their fathers often end up becoming whores. They don't know how to appropriately deal with the stimuli that life presents. And when they finally encounter it, they get turned out. And I don't want the bad teachers that can't keep their opinions to themselves to brainwash any child. When one is educated, one tends to have opinions on things. But, to suggest that you just want your children to learn facts would ultimately undermine them. For example, Robert Francoise Damien was executed for trying to assassinate the King of France. That's a fact. But that fact alone tells your child nothing about why the death of Damien represents a contradiction of the Enlightenment. It also doesn't educate your child as to why the contradictions of the Enlightenment are an important lesson to learn. And your child will be ill-served, because many of those contradictions are present in modern society, and we need people who are able to analyze issues contextually so as to solve them. Your child would be less able to provide adequate solutions to human problems because all they got was a bunch of dates, names of people and other irrelevant stuff in school. On a tangential point: all education is brainwashing or indoctrination. There is no difference. We educators give students information and punish them in various ways for not accepting that information. Having been punished academically, many of those students will then go on to be ostracized by society as whole. So, we make sure that they know everything we want them to know in the service of our needs. And we make damn certain that they think everything else is morally and intellectually wrong. A well educated person is simply someone who has been increasingly brainwashed over time, and in fewer, more concentrated subjects."	I think there are other ways to expose children to the dangers of the world than putting them in the middle of a stupid high school fight and they get pepper sprayed just going to class.  And an average adult doesn't experience something like that on a daily basis. You can teach without giving an opinion. You simply present the facts. An education isn't getting brainwashed, it's learning. Getting brainwashed is opinion based.	2

"Euthanasia. The obvious choice. Someone wishes to be killed because they cannot stand to live ( some times literally) and have felt this way for many years, and every moment for them is torture, then it would be wrong not to kill them.  As for questions like "" Kill 5 to save 10"", well, I don't want the blood of innocents on my hands, so if it came down to directly kill 5 or allow 10 to die, I don't know."	Of course your right and I would agree totally with you ,I found it an interesting question	2
I think Joe was making an LSD joke lol.	Oh right!   I actually found the LSD to be a little boring actually. A lot of hype for nothing I thought. Nah I've had a lot of personal experience with LSD as it happens. The first was on a school trip to Devon. It. Was. Amazing.	2
I know a guy who used ot buy petrol but due to rising fuel prices he steals it instead.	LOL. Watch that become a capital crime in the next few years.	2
Hmm? Long Shore Drift I was talking about. You know, the coastal process of transportation and deposition of sands along the beach. Yeah My first hands-on up-close experience was at Lulworth cove on a Geography trip. You never heard of Long Shore Drift?  But seriously Lysergic Acid Diethylamide was trippy...	Like I said, that actually explains a lot. ;)	2
Reparations by whom? If a sympathetic company wants to then thats their prerogative. It isn't the government's business to pay reparations with our tax money for something which I am not guilty of, and likely the majority of the civilized world is no longer guilty of. A) because it's wasteful and not the role of the government. B) governments have a tendency to be self-righteous, but really their roll is symbolic because the money isn't theirs.  Therefore I think if one wants to donate to a fund or organization at their own expense that is fine, but I'm not going to.	I don't see why I should have to pay for something that my ancestors may not have even had a hand in. Expecting white people to pay black people because their ancestors were slaves is pure racism. If a charity was created to pay these people and nothing was required of the average citizen, I say go for it. But forcing me to pay would be an infringement on my rights.	2
Hellno... Hell no.	Stop dissing my friends .	2
I wonder what's going on in those private debates.. .	Nothing at all. They just change them to private so no one else can reply.	2
I would be content if people were atleast listen to their opponents perspective. they don't have to agree with it, but they should atleast try to respect it. Most users on createdebate are good people willing to listen, but there are a few who are extremely frustrating.	I know what you mean lol .	2

The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1967   1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  3. When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  9. Do not harm little children.  10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.	"if a guest in your lair annoys you treat him cruelly and without mercy or you can just tell him to leave like civilized human being. when walking in open territory bother no one . If someone bothers you ask them to stop if they do not destroy them so the message I get from these two ""morals"" is annoyance is perfect justification for murder. Wow just wow"	2
Being lazy is fine, if anything it's good that you enjoy simple things like lying in for an extra five minutes. Same with being greedy, if you like stuff, that's not a bad thing necessarily. However, if either of them cause you to not do something you don't want to do, or to do something you regret, then that's where there's something wrong with it. Where it benefits you (or someone else), it's fine, it's good, but where it holds you back from something, or makes your (or someone elses) life worse, there's a problem.	"I think you just supported the ""no"" argument with that...did you accidently put it on the wrong side? Or am I mistaken?"	2

mmm, no, not necessarily. Refer to swarm intelligence (again) <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence  The masses dont really need to be that intelligent to do intelligent things, although things do tend to be more intelligent the more intelligent the mass, the correspondence is not neccessarily linear.	"From your wiki link: ""The inherent intelligence of swarms has inspired many social and political philosophers, in that the collective movements of an aggregate often derive from independent decision making on the part of a single individual. A common example is how the unaided decision of a person in a crowd to start clapping will often encourage others to follow suit, culminating in widespread applause. Such knowledge, an individualist advocate might argue, should encourage individual decision making (however mundane) as an effective tool in bringing about widespread social change.: Why did that one person start clapping? If it was for a good reason, then the whole swarm is smart. If it was for a dumb reason, then the whole swarm is really, really pathetic. Your link presents a stronger argument in favor of individual judgment, methinks."	2

We had a surplus when Bush was first elected. Now we are in a crisis. However, the republican party as a whole needs to be hels accountable. Not Bush. He is not smart enough to have done this much damage.	"I'm supporting you because i can help. If you look at my argument and facts there is a lot to the issue it's like an onion it has multiple layers to it. I'm a Realtor and mortgage broker so I know the history well and why we are where we are. 1993 was huge for bankers when Clinton signed that bill it added extra lending liquidity and created ""Fiat Money"" or money out of thin air because it allowed bankers to extend what they call their fractional reserve lending. For every $1 i now can lend $30 dollars. It's scary. But when they did this is helped loosen banks requirements and loans where being handed out like candy on a street. I can keep going on but basically when banks make loans to people like you and me they make money the government makes money while you and I get stuck with the bill. I can lecture on this for 2 hours if given the chance. But that is one layer to the onion that I was talking about."	2

I don't mean it's null like it quits, I mean it's null like when you're doing an equation and you have a 1 on the top and a 1 on the bottom. 1/1 equals 1. So there's no need to count them, then comes the rest of the work, the mother's carrying the baby, practically feeding the baby, giving it oxygen, all of this for nine months. Yet this would continue all day if we try to argue on opinion, I have a question that I believe should clear things all up, yet I won't mind continuing if I'm wrong. They can not split the baby up, one of their decisions has to reign supreme. As unbiased as I can ask, Who's decision should the doctor go with, the mother's or the father's?	Yes but the debate just asks if men should have much more of a say in the decision of this child.	2
"I believe them to both be equally true. ""Better"" is used in two contexts."	Then I suppose I should clarify the question. In general do we do immoral things because we really want to cause serious harm, or because we fail to see the seriousness of the harm the immoral behavior causes? I understand that sometimes it is the former, and sometimes it is the latter, but which is more commonplace?	2
Can you think of any religion that does that besides cults?	Cult: system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or subject. By this definition, most religions are cults.	2

Polar bears at the zoo are well fed. When someone jumps the fence to pet a polar bear, the polar bear doesn't try to gently help the person safely back over the fence where he belongs. No, the polar bear rips his limbs off. Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. ;)	Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. If you are able to safely close the distance between yourself and an attacker (which is required to apply an armbar), and the situation is life or death, there are other techniques (that also are not Jiu Jitsu) that would be more advisable. In a true rage...a hyper-extended elbow can be ignored.	2

But our evolutionary system is already unstable. People who would normally have died off are artificially maintained.	"But like I've said before, you're going on the assumption that you know what is meant by a beneficial evolutinary trait. Evolution only works by adapting an organism to become successful within its environment. If our environment ""artificially"" maintains organisms that would otherwise have been wiped out, that just simply means that the selection pressures have changed. It's still evolution, just not as we would have expected. What is meant by an evolutionary stable system is where we reach a point of equilibriam where evolutionary changes and mutations don't cause the organism to have a better chance of survival. For an extremely crude example, whist in the wild we may expect an animal who would grow a third eye to be far more sucessful than other animals, could you also say the same for a human. Would a human with three eyes: A) Have a better chance of survival than a two eyed human, or B) Reproduce more often than a two eyed human? If not, then we have reached a point where evolutionary beneficial mutations are not causing those who have received those mutations to benefit over others. The evolutionary system is therefore stable, and it will take a change in our environment rather than a change in ourselves to cause evolution to take us down a different path. But just to reiterate, saying things such as ""People who would normally have died off are artificially maintained"" simply means that that fact is a selection process, and what you would classically have expected to be beneficial traits, such as strength and speed, are no longer beneficial within our environment. This doesn't mean we are de-evolving or that evolution has stopped though; it is simply operating in a way we were not expecting. Society is our environment."	2

"There will always be wind so long as the earth rotates, however streams and rivers are never consistant and some even dry up or the water level drops or rises to extreme conditions.

When the people just above poverty spends their money, it goes to the wealthy business owners. And the interest goes to banks, which are even wealthier.  The primary point is that you have a set of people who have less, but are forced to pay more for these things, a large set of people, most people actually when you are talking about homes and cars.  The wealthy business owners in this situation would not need nor want to spend more of their money to stimulate the economy, a feat they already could have done, but have so far chosen not to. This is exactly correct, and exactly why supply-side economics are utter bullshit and hurt economies more than help any time enacted.  Why are you disputing though? My point is that buying on credit is not good for the economy long term.	I'm disputing mostly to spur conversation, but also because the point wasn't about the importance of cash or credit, it was about buying more in general. The credit aspect was added so that people wouldn't throw up the Great Depression example where everything was bought on credit. I also agree that credit is bad long term.	2
What kind of question is this? Obviously both. Non Christians, who strongly support their side or just oppose the other side discriminated against Christians, and vice versa.	"Thats not necessarily the definition of ""discrimination"" it is more complex than that. Discrimination is societies persecution of victims, not simple opposition. Black people opposed what white people did during the civil rights movement of the late 50s/early 60s does that mean black people were discriminating against whites? HELL NO!"	2

Please do. (explain) Do you mean that Atheism is some sort of post-christianity? - with the morals but discarding the fantasy?? If I understand you correctly, I would rather say that the scientific method is the mother of atheism.	Do you mean that Atheism is some sort of post-christianity? - with the morals but discarding the fantasy?? Without being too critical of both Atheists and Christians, both terms indicate conclusions of the mind predicated upon supposed facts. The facts, as it were, lead to contradictory conclusions; however, the conclusions are not necessarily valid inferences of what is to be thought of as fact. Or, explained another way:  There may be in fact a logical validation of the existence of an Alpha Creator, if you will; but, the position of the Atheist, in contradiction of the Christian, contradicts only the Christian definition of God. Example: God = Alpha Christian definition of God=Beta Atheist’s position, God= not Beta As long as Christians draw invalid inferences, via deductive reasoning, or specifically the lack thereof, the Atheist view point only contradicts the invalid inference of the Christian. And consequently both camps are disputing a falsity. The atheist contradicts, validly I might add, the Christian definition of God. But atheism is not a valid contradiction of a valid definition of God.  Now, having slightly elaborated my viewpoint I submit the following proposition: The validity of the Atheist position concerning God is no more true or false than the Christian definition of God. So, in conclusion the Atheistic viewpoint only contradicts the Christian definition of God. In answer to your first question I will simply say that some Atheists are more moral than some of their Christian counterparts, and that, without so much mysticism.  If I understand you correctly, I would rather say that the scientific method is the mother of atheism. That is fine, but I will submit unto you that I think you would disagree with that statement after some additional facts. #1 The scientific method is an instrument for knowledge by the rationality of a sound mind. #2 The current Atheistic viewpoint is the consequent contradiction of the Christian definition of God. And finally, Atheism (as defined) exists only by reason of a contradiction of the notion of God; for without the notion of God no Atheist can contradict a viewpoint that does not exist. If the thoughts of God and religion were none existent then so to shall be the viewpoint of an Atheist. The scientific method does not create an Atheist, it produces sound knowledge apart from unreasonable reason (oxymoron). I can discuss that matter in even greater detail if so be you would care to.	2

Patriotism is one of the most retarded and childish ideas that still manages to permeate popular culture as a perceived virtue, even though it is a baseless and undeserved pride derived from the fallacy that being born within the same imaginary borders makes two people's individual achievements somehow shared, despite no mutual involvement from either party.	No, fools, Anarchronist is completely right, and i agree with him 100% Imagine if there were no borders. You think that suddenly, if you cross a 1cm line, everyone changes..? Nope, not at all, we're all just one of the same species!	2

No I haven't seen your video, but Marriage was made between a man and a woman. I never said that no one should get married. Look, I don't really care about gay marriage, I think there are more important problems right now then Gay marriage.	"It may have been made for a man and a woman but it needs to adapt to a society where men and women aren't the only ones dating. Things used to be made for blacks only or for whites only but they adapted. Look, I don't really care about gay marriage, I think there are more important problems right now then Gay marriage. Ohhohohoh, look what we have here. A ""Shut up...that's why"" argument. It's one where you feel that the point shouldn't go on anymore so you try to stop it, in this case by addressing a more serious issues. Yet, to gay people who want to get married but can't, this is a more important issue. That, ""Let's talk about something else"" argument only works if you really leave the issue alone, yet the people against equal marriage rights, never leave the issue alone, hence the reason it's still a 'problem'."	2
Reality is purely conceptual and the word conceptual is purely conceptual so we might as well just say this about everything then and in the end realise the definition of 'yes' and 'no' is purely conceptual and this side is conceptually capable of being the right side.

But believeing in santa clause is not a relgion. Relgions have to do with one's belief about a god.	Yes, but atheism is not believing in god. Not believing in something is not a religion. For example, I assume you don't believe in Zeus, so is your lack of belief in Zeus a religion?	2

Thanks, but if that's the rule and they are not leaving, then they are doing something wrong.	The law is blind to a certian extent. I get where you are coming from but I have more faith in humanity than that. The people giving out tickets are not going to punish people who are waiting for rides/ other people and not causing a problem. If they do I don't think it would be hard to challenge in court... but when it reaches that point it has gone too far. I'm sure the authorities are fully aware of this.	2
No way jose! i dont like it at all! read mine =)	"good thing i drive :) but it sucks for all those ""lali gagers"""	2
"There's also the question as to whether we can trust that he's actually dead... Most likely he is, but what kind of elitist bullshit is it that we, the American people, aren't allowed to see the ""pictures"" of his corpse or the video him dying? Just a couple of well-liked reporters and politicians that we can all trust?  Getting pretty tired of this Empire crap."	Also true. There is so much the government doesn't tell us. Perhaps he was publicly buried so we would all see someone being put in the ocean, but they actually caught him, and are brainwashing him into being there head influencer. Maybe he already worked for him, and saying they killed him was a scapegoat to get Obama accepted.	2
Yep. One day that 99.99% of bacteria that die from Germ-X will decrease to 80% and then 70% and the 50% until a god germ is made and it wipes out all of humanity.	I agree, although I think it's likely to happen much faster than that. We're already seeing a range of antibiotic resistant bacteria which are immune to standard treatment regimens. And with a slew of superbugs emanating from Asia and Europe each year, we probably do have something to be somewhat concerned about.	2
That was an add from the 50's. We've come a long way, baby ;)	man, the 50's... just wow... wow...	2

This message serves to prove how our minds can do amazing things! Impressive things! In the beggining it was hard but now, on this line your mind is reading is automatically with out even thinking about it, be proud! Only certain people can read this. Please forward if can read this.

"I think attire is important for success because the first impression of you people get from your clothes. It is proven that when candidate for job comes for an interview, interviewer makes decision in first 30 seconds. He will already know if that person is right for them or not. That's why dressing properly is important. And ""Dressing for success"" actually makes sense."	I totally agree that your attire is very important for your success. It gives you a small priviledge before your competitor, because it is more pleasant to deal with you.	2

The better in point A, for my statement, is that of being better for oneself. As in it is better for me to steal X because I have no money and need some; however, it is not better for others, nor morally better. The better in the second sense is that of doing that which is better morally.	"But would it not be a case of ""not knowing better"" to mistakenly think that stealing is beneficial. The thief does not understand theft as doing harm to himself. Presumably if he did, he would not steal"	2
The Death Penalty is just state sanctioned revenge, so people should be imprisoned and if they are deemed to be mentally unstable they should be kept in a secure hospital and treated. The other thing that is bad about the death penalty is the fact that people are kept on Death Row for years that in itself is cruel and unusual punishment and negates the argument that the death sentance is better than keeping them in prison for years as the average stay on Death Row for an inmate is 13 years and the longest stay on Death Row was 34 years.	I agree with that. The death penalty is more terrifying as you knowing you can die at any time, than actually dying.	2
You can't claim that he's crazy for believing in mysterious spirits inside of us from aliens. Look, half the population believes if they eat bread and wine solemnly it becomes the corpse of a guy who died 2000 years ago. And that cannibalizing that millennia old mummy will save you from a scary pit of fire that you go to after you die based on if you played your cards right. His spirits are the same as these soul things, and his refusing to believe in psychiatry is just like some people's refusal to believe in evolution.	I love your argument. As asinine as I think certain beliefs in this world are, I always try my best, as a human being, to be tolerant and accepting of however any other fellow human being decides to come to terms with their existence on this earth. People want answers to EVERYTHING and when they don't have the answer to such a big question (WHY?), they may come up with some seemingly crazy ideas. But who are any of us to judge? <br />And I just got way too deep on the Tom Cruise debate ...	2

The shooting if the head may be humane but the fact that he just left the horse there and actually filmed is inhumane. If he did this off camera then maybe it would be a little better. Filming it makes it worse because it shows that you don't really care that they just died. I'm sure you wouldn't want to be filmed being shot the head. That's the parts I'm saying are in humane. I probably should have clarified that in my last argument.	Thats what's interesting, why should you care if an animal is taped or not being killed?  Do you feel a particular connection to the horse in this video? Do you know the horse? Would you feel more or less the same had it been a person, a human whom you did not know?  I would imagine humans would feel more prone to be upset if another human gets blasted in the head than a horse.  Why does filming make it more or less humane?  Humane is a very interesting topic in how it pertains to how humans view the world, and are protective, of the world around them.	2
head explodes  	And I know a precise scientific definition for all of these. Should I feel proud of this? Hell yes :)	2
"Yes but my example is a typical couple who ate both either for or deciding not to.  If that's the case, there's no debate. There's nothing for him to weigh in on, it's already decided that their opinion is mutual. Yet in the case of situations where mutualism is not the case, the choice should come down solely on the woman.  Those are his cells in her body making up half that baby and bringing it to life. Those are also her cells, or else the cells in him would have already made a baby, yet the work that needs to be done for the baby, is left up to her completely. Think about the story of <a href='http://www.storybus.org/stories_and_activities/the_little_red_hen/story'>""The Little Red hen"". Everybody wanted some of the hen's bread at the end yet no one did anything. (The man added his DNA, but the woman did as well so that kind of makes that act null). In the end of the story, the person who did the most work, enjoyed the bread all by herself, because being the only person doing anything she was perfectly entitled. No one felt like she was stingy, or greedy, or selfish for taking all of the finished product she made for herself."	The cells work together. By your logic the father cells just start the egg off and then quit when the baby grows with both of the parents cells and even when the baby is born both the fathers and mothers cells ate still working. So that story doesnt really apply. Unless I am misunderstanding you friend.	2

The separation of the two, made one worse for wear, and one better by comparison. The reason the schools for black people were not as good as the schools for white people was because of prejudice. People didn't like blacks so they treated them and their property as still unequal. If people are equally together, but separate in title, then the prejudice of people will remain and they will act when they see the title. After the two were mixed (the schools) the prejudice remained for a time, but was slowly defeated. If gay people are equally married like straight people the prejudice when finding out they are gay, will remain but will hopefully also be defeated in time.	If people are equally together, but separate in title, then the prejudice of people will remain and they will act when they see the title. 1. If someone has a problem with homosexuals having a civil union they will most likely have a problem with them being married.  2. A title is meaningless, its just words on paper. Regardless of the words on paper a marriage and civil union are the same thing. After the two were mixed (the schools) the prejudice remained for a time, but was slowly defeated. Yes, but acting like having different legal titles (that most sensible people don't care about anyway) is equivalent to segregation is outrageous. Gays go to the same schools, stores and transportation as straights, there is no law separating the two groups.  If gay people are equally married like straight people the prejudice when finding out they are gay, will remain but will hopefully also be defeated in time. You don't have to have the title of married for people to find out that you are gay. As I had stated earlier homosexuals are integrated into society and they are not separated from straights, the only difference is that from a legal stand point their legal unions have different names. You don't defeat prejudice by changing titles, you do it by integrating the actual people and as far as I can tell, gays and straights use the same services.	2
The definition of a theist is somebody who believes in some sort of higher power or superior. What the higher power does, or how much it interferes with our world isn't in the definition. Anyone who believes in the existence of a God is in fact a theist. You can deny it, but you still are.	"The definition of a theist is somebody who believes in some sort of higher power or superior. Which if you weren't so ignorant, you would realize that I never claimed to recognize any being so described. What the higher power does, or how much it interferes with our world isn't in the definition. I don't think of god as a ""higher power"" but you keep on dishonestly pretending that i, like you, take a theist view of what god is. Anyone who believes in the existence of a God is in fact a theist. Maybe someday you will develop the capacity for lateral thought. Until then you will be a slave to the false choices you can't see past. You can deny it, but you still are. Just keep on thinking of god as a ""higher power"" while calling yourself atheist, and I'll keep on pointing out that atheists should consider that definition invalid."	2

Your sentence didn't make sense.  	Lol, sorry. I changed what I wanted to say in the middle of the sentence. I intended to say: If you think that everyone drinks till they vomit, you have truly misunderstood something. I have never vomited because of drinking, because I don't drink to that point. Few people I know drink till they vomit every time, it's only a couple of times it gets out of hand and you drink till you vomit.	2
well thats the most ridiculous shit i've ever heard----------------	It's true, though.	2
Hey, Mark.. I was surprised that you made this discussion considering the time you spent speaking of science and reality but it would be hard to really explain this from a non-christian perspective. I am a Buddhist and we believe there are different planes of existence, Earth is one. So Earthly evidence can not be used to test unearthly speculations. One of the 3 main human intelligence is SQ or spiritual intelligence. This is what you may call a 'soul'. If you want to prove planes of existence you have better chance of proving with meditation than a test tube. The neocortex which activates imagination, dreams and emotion can be trained for higher spiritual awareness practised in the far east for thousands of years. The mystical term for it is the Third Eye. which is to see clearly. there might be an answer to our universe's biggest questions but alas, even Buddha couldnt figure it out.	I am just curious to what other people think of the statement. I like to get a wide variety of opinions in the hopes that I can improve my own.  I'd likely state something along the following lines: How can you assert the existence of the metaphysical without any evidence in the first place?  I mean, I could say a completely undetectable metaphysical <a href='http://nyan.cat/'>poptart cat is in my car and that would be an equally valid argument.  The point is statements like this are meaningless, for I could come up with any hypothetical metaphysical object/being and it would be equally valid.	2
In 2029 if we can stop Apophis then yes. I think things will be pretty sharp.	"There should be an ""End of the world"" holiday..."	2
Just because one cop acts one way, doesn't mean all cops are like that. True. It just seems like there's a whole lot of unjust police brutality going on these days. Does this link work any better? <a href='http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/roy-middleton-shot-in-his-driveway-by-deputies-mistaken-for-car-thief'>http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/roy-middleton-shot-in-his-driveway-by-deputies-mistaken-for-car-thief 	I actually looked up the story after I sent you that argument. I understand that they thought he had a gun when he turned around after being told to multiple times, but what I don't understand is why they shot 15 rounds at him. That seems a bit excessive. There are a lot of shitty cops out there. There is also a lot of corruption. Sometimes the authority gets to a cop's head.  I don't feel like police brutality is increasing, I just think that it is better documented than it used to be. However, I do believe that crime is increasing and more and more people seem to be defying the police. The people who are usually victims of police brutality often aren't as innocent as they make themselves out to be.  There are definitely some crazy cops out there, but I find it hard to believe that they're just shooting and beating people for no reason. Something has to trigger that sort of reaction.	2

Public Schools expose children to alternative ideas and methods of thinking as opposed to the single-track mind instilled in them by their parents since birth. Most public school kids also know how to handle and be around other people whereas a home schooled child usually has under-developed social skills.

Yes George W. Bush should be responsible for our financial crisis I think because he was the President when we started to go into debt. It's bad enough that we can't even pay off our debt that we have with foreign countries.	So when the banks and government are selling these loans and banks are making billions and government is making billions on the taxes they generate, when you have banks and government making money together it will take a bubble to burst before each one of them starts pointing the finger at each other and saying that it's their fault when it's both their faults. More governments fault because they allowed them to lend like that. Where Bush comes in and adds more gasoline to the fire is that he allowed derivatives to take part and now banks can even lend more money they don't have because now in case of default they will get paid back from the insurance they just bought in case the banks make bad loans. Thats why AIG and Leigh-mans went Bye Bye they couldn't fork up what they had insured.  I'm going to stop their because that's layer two of the the saga if I keep going I start to get frustrated because the media doesn't try to really explain this to the public. But believe me government had multiple times to stop it starting with Clinton and they chose to ignore it. But bottom line the banks get the bailouts and because of this Fiat Money which caused hyper inflation of the real estate market people who bought during this bought at a price that wasn't real and those people are the ones that are getting screwed by the banks greed and the governments greed.	2

As much as I'd love a review of the mental state, performed by a real psychiatrist, of about 50% of the tea party prior to allowing them a vote, 1. The amount of resources this would take would make it ridiculously expensive and nearly impossible to implement. 2. It would allow far to much room for any political group in power to surpress the vote.	1.

I think the US or should I say the present government may have trouble justifying intervening in Syria without the backup of other countries, especially after Obama said he would be withdrawing troops from foreign wars I don't think the American public will be happy with him sending them out to a new one	However, if Obama is disliked at the moment a successful war could seriously boost his popularity and even leave him with a good legacy. I have a feeling that is all he needs to care about at the moment, since he cannot get re-elected he just wants to make sure he's remembered in a good light.	2
"Well, I guess the swearing part has freedom of speech on it's side. But the purpose of freedom of speech is to give people a right to speak their opinions, it's not really about the way in which people say it. If you can't express you opinion without swearing then you have issues.  What about the argument of ""it's just a word"" Well, If they are talking about what the word means for example the F word, then children definitely should not be exposed to it. And if those things are not censored then, guess what?.. ... Everyone will be exposed to it."	Not unless your 18 =] you can yell FUCK in your gymnasium and teachers cant do anything about it ( FOS ) But I do not think that children should be exposed to any kinds of those obscenities. If you say ' its just a word ' then does that make it right to just say the F word anywhere at all times? Curse words really are not very good sentence enhancers and kids should not and do not deserve to be exposed to things like nudity and foul language. When they're 15+ have a ball!!!	2

"Ok, so, you're saying, since you've never ""seen"" an ape (which is the wrong animal, again) evolve into a human, and never seen God create a human, God wins this debate? So, just because we haven't proven we're from chimpanzees, gives grounds to say God made us? There's a huger spectrum out there. And again, I'll say, the theory of evolution isn't that humans are from chimpanzees; it's just an idea because our DNA's are closely related. Because, you're right, there is no proof of THAT. But there's proof of evolution itself. And it has nothing to do with creationism. This is the ignorance in today's society and it is merely all about ""science vs. religion"" which is again, two totally different things that shouldn't be combined as much as they have been."

"But due to the this kind of taxes the life of pets will improve. According to thee article  ""Tax Write-offs : A Guide for the Pet Owners"" by John Huddleston: ""The business may very well be able to deduct for the expenses of having a guard dog. And a voluntary sponsor of a therapy animal, for example a guide dog, could possibly be able to write off the vet expenses and bills, and such other unreimbursed expenses (these are considered charitable donations). And there have similarily been tax law rulings that have allowed tax write-offs for expenses associated with caring for animals that serve the hearing-impaired, visually-impaired, and physcially-impaired persons. And there are as well tax deductions in expenses related to keeping animals considered part of an animal-breeding business. """	Next thing you know the government is going to tax the air I breathe ;)	2
"Well, that's a great thing that I would like to hear from more people. The decision of having a certain pet based on your own availability and your living space is something 99% of the people don't do, but should do. A dog is made to run free with his ""family"" and suffers from being left alone and in small spaces (even small dogs). Dogs can suffer from depression, but many people don't know that. A cat is pretty much the choice for an apartment. He's a good company as well, he plays with you, and when you go out, he's ok with that. And he also can be left outside and it'll be ok with him. I prefer dogs mainly because they are more like your close buddy. I have dogs because I have a big backyward, otherwise I wouldn't have them."	You make very good points .	2

"You're a dumbass OP, for several reasons. You big meanie pants. Jesus cries when you talk like that!  First, asking for help is not prayer. You need help if you think that! If a god existed, perhaps help would be there. Perhaps starving children could get food, instead of lying on the ground, their stomachs burning as they lie there, too weak to move, just strong enough to pray. Then they die. If the above situation had never happened, if poverty and hunger did not kill children, perhaps I wouldn't be so hostile. But it does.  I Shall pray, and see what god has to say about this.... I make sure that those who are in need of help receive help. You may know that I am addressing problems with your soul when the ugliness I show you becomes unbearable....thus saith the Lord Praying is useless and a waste of time. It's pointless feel-good activity with no real results. when you have too many illusions about prayer it's almost a complete waste of time Praying is not having hope. I have hope, and I can wish for things Praying is being verbally clear and persistent about what you hope for. The Lord gets involved to change childish notions into loving action. until I get on my knees and ask a god to do my bidding, I am not praying. Regarding prayer, it is not the posture of the body that concerns god but the condition of the soul. Praying is not asking someone real for help. Prayer can only be heard by someone real I ask Jesus for help, I get nothing. I ask a real person? I get a yes or no. Not some vague ""It's god's will"" bullshit answer. Pray to god and tend to his answers and you will witness healing. Just as faith is not the same as earned trust, prayer is not hope. god can help you improve the way you make use of those concepts...Ask! and tend to the answers! Hallelujah...he is working in your heart!"	You big meanie pants. Jesus cries when you talk like that! Classic! :)	2
"""Thomas Jefferson first suggested that we not have a standing army, and wrote a series of letters in 1787, as the Constitution was being debated, urging James Madison and others to write it into the Constitution. The idea was, instead of a standing army, for every able-bodied man in the nation to be a member of a local militia, under local control, with a gun in his house. If the nation was invaded, word would come down to the local level and every man in the country would be the army. Switzerland has such an army, and many have suggested it's one reason why Hitler never tried to invade this neighbor."" P.S. Please don't throw around ""national security"" as if that handy little term needs no explanation. If you wish to include ""national security"" in your argument, please say what exactly you mean by it. Security of US citizens from foreign invasion? Security of US business interests in the middle east? Thanks! note: For the purposes of this debate, the Air Force and Navy are excluded."	Switzerland managed to stay out of two World Wars, and they're positioned in the center of Europe. I think that says quite a bit.	2

"surrogacy is a good and benefitial way for both sides, for a childless couple as well as for a surrogate mother. interfertile couples can feel the parenthood on their own, with the help of ""surrogate mothers"" service."	Yes, because if a woman can choose to kill an inconvenient child, then why not make a loved one? If a woman has a choice of when and how she has children, then she has the right to make children she wants and can afford. We allow women to terminate pregnancies that are unwanted. We allow them to give away unwanted children through adoption. If a woman can choose to kill an inconvenient child, why not make a loved one? Why not allow a willing woman to carry her sterile sister's child? Why not allow an older woman to carry her infertile daughter's baby? As long as all parties consent, voluntary surrogacy is as much a woman's choice as abortion. Until there are viable and successful artificial wombs, surrogate motherhood is the only option for a biological family unit's creation in some cases. Why deny them that choice, when killing unwanted children is allowed?	2
Well, thank YOU!! I just hope I haven't made an ass of myself with my sometimes less than punny <a href='http://global3.memecdn.com/Hot-air-balloon_c_92212.jpg#funny%20hot%20air%20baloon%20gif%20500x689'>hot air! :)	I saw something like that at the gas station today!	2
"Earth has a common ancestor, they were not created according to their ""kinds"" The Hebrew translates into ""by means of the succeeding species"". Any person whom studies evolution knows that the connecting generations (1 &2;, 2&3;,........100&101;) are the same species. That is following the Bible. It is the (1......101) that are not in the same species. However god says the different animals came about by staying in the same species, but changed my means of the species in succeeding species. Aka evolution. Earth did exist before the sun Already covered! The only mention of the sun is in relation to the earth for light when the clouds cleared, not creation of the sun. Look at any study Bible and you will see this is declarative, not active creation. _"	"Genesis 1: 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. ^This is him, on the fourth ""day"", creating these entities.  The Hebrew translates into ""by means of the succeeding species"". Source please"	2
In Brazilian schools there is not a specific subject about sex education. Still, in the humdrum events of daily life, children can watch spicy scenes in a soap-opera, a movie and even in the streets, or see a magazine picture. These situations may obviously provoke a natural curiosity in the children about sex. If there were sex education classes in school, then all the students would get enough information to learn everything they should know about it, so they can have a good and healthy sex life later, when they are ready to. In fact, most parents do not feel comfortable to talk about sex with their children, and neither do the children. The teenagers usually get information only with friends, which is not something reasonable, since they probably rely on what they learnt from television programs, websites and web blogs that are not always reliable. Even if a father or a mother feels open to talk to their son or daughter about sex, they may not have enough recent information about sex or anything related to it. After all, we always have something to learn. For this reason it is necessary to have a well-trained professional who knows how to approach this theme to teenagers and also to their parents, because it is also important to them, since they probably still have doubts. This way, they would know that this subject should be faced seriously and if they can trust the teacher and the school. It might be surprising that in the 21st century students may only get information about sex in Biology or Science classes. It is certainly not enough, since these subjects will not discuss everything related to sex. They usually focus on life matters such as “a baby is made through sexual intercourse between a man and a woman” and teaches about prevention, telling that “AIDS, HPV and syphilis are sexually transmitted diseases, so that is why it is important to always use a condom”. A sex education class would treat and discuss themes like early pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptive methods, menstrual cycle, masturbation, male and female reproductive systems and phases of the human development and of pregnancy. Besides, it is very important for the teacher of this subject to be prepared to deal with possible psychological issues some children may have – such as repression or sex abuse history –, and also the teacher needs to develop discussions about relationships, feelings, emotions and sexual orientation. Some Biology teachers may not be capable of doing this. In countries such as United States or Canada, sex education programs have been in their syllabuses for decades. It is high time Brazil developed special classes to promote a healthy sex education to its youth. Joyce2E & Daniella2E	The youth of today has easy access to the media, which can be inappropriate in many ways. Children can be exposed to pornography, discovering their sexuality alone and precariously. That might even develop a conflict that could be avoided if the matter were placed on the table since the early hour. School has the central purpose of educating children and teenagers, preparing them for a better life. Then why not include sexual education in their program, by showing with a sufficient grounding the best way of everything to happen? The purpose which would be assigned to the school is not to encourage sex, but to alert and take possible doubts that may arise. Thus, it would raise a teenager who is more informed, more able to discuss the matter, becoming a more responsible adult.	2
I am a man. How is it that people are answering so short when the minimum number of letters is 50?	I think it has to do something with their points... Or something.	2

If your talking about who I think your talking about I tried to intervene and got a bollicking, I couldn't give a toss about people arguing but making debates just to slag each other off is childish, maybe we need the internet version of the naughty step if you act like a child you get your account suspended for a day something like that	I was referring to my sister Abby. I don't know how to even begin handling all that drama.	2
There's no shame in opting out of a Xmas gift for the boss. Gifts for your boss are not compulsory and if times are tight then you'd be better of saving your money. Believe me, your boss doesn't expect a gift and won't feel any different if you don't chip in.  I don't expect my employees to buy me Xmas gifts. I know that I make more money than them so it can feel awkward getting a gift.	I know how you feel. I used to train student employees on a one-on-one basis over the course of a month. I was deeply touched by the occasional gift, all of which I still have. But it bothered the hell out of me to take what little they made that way and I always compromised by buying them lunch so that they weren't out any of their hard earned and scarce money.	2
I believe that God is imortal, he never ended or began. But you believe, that there is no God or anything. But in the end, there has to be SOMETHING that created everything. I mean, it can't be made by nothing. You believe its nothing, I believe it's God. God is the source I believe created everything. What is your source?	I believe the Big Bang theory created the universe, and that it was an entirely random event.	2

"""Open up your mind and see like me"". Haha. I have seen a few people alter their position. Usually only a little and after great effort. What is most bothersome is when a person drops the whole context of debating and just starts insulting the opposition."	"There are some that just insult people because they are arrogant and believe they are a lot smarter than the people they are debating, I can never figure out why they bother debating, there are some who get insulting when they lose their temper which is normally when their debating ""skills"" disappear"	2
I didn't ask based on a religion. I asked if you thought one way or the other on a creator.	"But every answer will be dependent on the persons faith. The only types of creation (as far as I know) are either through science or through a deity. If we were to assume that the ""creator"" has a gender then the only option is through a deity as a scientific theorem has no gender :) But if we based it off of a deity then it becomes dependent on religion by definition"	2
Moral by His definition, not yours. & As per your sense of morality. & There is no truth in morality; only opinion. [Do to others as you would have done to yourself] The 9th commandment leads me to this conclusion, not my standard of morality, but that set out in the Bible. Does your entire argument for the validity of these claims lies on the conclusion that unnecessary pain is something we should want to happen to ourselves? There is no truth in morality; only opinion. Again, I refer to the ten commandments, and the words of Jesus. Christianity teaches that there is objective morality, either it is false there, false here, or God's actions here are morally correct.	I've noticed that responses like the above from theists always allow them never to concede the presence of flaws in their texts or doctrines, which makes me wonder whether the believer is playing an intentional game with the nontheist/skeptic, or whether their faith has brainwashed them to such an extent that they are genuinely incapable of seeing them. Either way, there's a problem.	2
Let the parents decide. If they're mad about it, why do they let their kid have one? It reminds me of the time when parents of obese kids protested McDonalds, but still ate there several times a week.	"what do you men by ""why do they let them have one?""what one an face book id?"	2
"That is another scenario in which ""kissing ass"" can be advantageous...not so much getting ahead as not being a target. I've been in almost the exact same situation. Sometimes being a nice person has unforseen advantages.  Off topic: Please understand that I only ask this because there are a few nuances of the site I still don't understand: did you ban me from the debate where I was (my words) ""being a bitch to you""? Or did you erase the debate (if so, you don't have to explain if you don't wish)? Or a glitch? Because I cannot see anything related to it, and I'm curious. If you did ban, no hard feelings. But it seems to have totally disappeared and I wasn't thinking banning had that quality (never been banned that I know of)?"	No, I deleted that debate myself... I did some looking around and I think I was wrong... I don't think that JustIgnoreMe was a troll after all so it wasn't fair for me to make that accusation.  I honestly did think so at first he was but after further review I think I was wrong... I have had people from the former site I was on target me so I tend to be a little paranoid... that's my problem... as for you? I have never had a problem with you therefore I would not ban you. My banning rule here is the same as it has been on other sites... I don't ban, but I will make exceptions for trolls(fake accounts) and children... I'm not arguing with kids.	2
You did partly change my mindset I mean I've always been opposed to what Obama had been doing with Syria but I had always viewed getting out of Iraq an accomplishment looking at it now after your argument it was completely insignificant. You also got me with the debt Obama raised it to a higher rate than Bush but you failed to acknowledge that the debt has been dropping since 2012, also I kind of got you on most of the Obamacare debate especially on saving money its not as bad as Republicans like Ted Cruise and Mitch McConnell make it. Also it kind of made sense to support Obama in 2008 I mean Bush was leaving office there was no better guy to vote for but him even the libertarians which I assume your political positions link up to the most had Bob Barr, nobody liked Barr so I don't really think you were fooled. Also quite clearly I don't think you are a Conservative but the way you debated seemed a little center right IMO!	Well that's partly good news... but I don't think you got me on the Obamacare argument other than that one statement regarding the 50+ employees. Obamacare is still more trouble than it's worth.  The debt may be decreasing, but not very fast... and if we enter a war with Syria, then there is a possibility that the debt will begin to increase again.	2
Guys I'm being serious right now. Stop dicking around for 5 seconds and realize the situation we are in.	OK. I'm calming down. I stopped dicking around. What's up? What's more important than boobies ;)	2
Wtf kind of sick shit is this? Seriously do you also go around killing them yourself?	I hope they are just joking cuz I really wuv cats and dogs and would never eat either one:) p.s. I tried to give you a point, but it wouldn't let me?? It said I was raving too fast.... WTH??? Why is that a problem, LOL	2
I've been shit on by pigeons 3 times. count them, three.  But unless you're directly under the sun, it's not the shadows you have to worry about, they come when you least expect it.	Actually the sun has to be at your back. They normally make their approach from that angle. Come in low, drop their load and pull up at the last minute. Like Kamikazes! You feel it hit the back of your head as you spot them pulling up.... laughing at your sorry ass. I hate those things. Why doesn't global warming kill them off first ? ;)	2
<a href='http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11959'>http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11959 	Great Article. Cato Institute is awesome. My favorite is how FDR is constantly voted in the top 5, yet he exacerbated by Great Depression by large government spending by being architect of the welfare state, and jailer of more than 100,000 innocent Japanese-Americans. Also, academia's liberal bias skews the presidential rankings, to be sure, but it turns out that right-wing academics swoon for imperial presidents.	2
What does this even mean ? Its okay if people cry. Crying is healthy. ...........	i agree crying relives stress off of whatever is hurting you and it releases endorphin into your body to help you feel better. Don't you always feel better after you cry?	2
Everything doesn't fit our needs - we changed to adapt to what was available in our environment.  I agree that the Earth being able to sustain life is an extraordinary coincidence, but when you consider that our planet is just one of many planets in our solar system which is just one of many solar systems in our galaxy which is just one of many galaxies in our universe which is just one of many universes in existence, the chances of life such as ours existing for a while on a planet like ours increases dramatically.	Yes, but what I mean is - that I think (just think) that atheist maybe take this all for granted. I mean - it is a miracle that we're alive. ONE simple little change in the history of both the universe and the human history, and you or me would never exist!	2
Of course of course! Whenever I have a bad day, I just come home and listen to Atom Heart Mother and that generally cleans me up. Listening to Alans Psycedellic Breakfast at the end is a great way for me to to maintain my insanity. Oh Syd, you crazy diamond. - I end up quoting Pink Floyd all to regularly on this site yet no one seems to notice. It makes me feel old.	Well, if you like Floyd, you'll probably like The Alan Parsons Project, Enigma, Vangelis and Tangerine Dream.	2
Bullcrap. What debate on here has ever been settled? Everything gets recycled again, becuse people dont want answers, they want to argue. Were arguing, me and you, and what answers are you trying to get?	Just because you haven't had a debate that ended good on here doesn't mean it's impossible. I have had debates where I left with a feeling that I had learned something.	2
OK, fair enough.  If the future is encoded in dreams, then we have lost the knowledge to decode our dreams because I don't know of anyone who can predict the future based on his dreams. Thus, having lost the knowledge to decode our dreams is the same thing as not being able to predict the future through our dreams.	Much better and you made me think! But have you ever experienced really strange dejavu ?	2
How does a dictator have more power than an absolute monarch. I find the monarch to be much more superior in terms of power and decision making.	The absolute monarch and the dictator both own their nation as far as absolute rule is concerned, but the dictator has the power to choose his/her heir. While a king can only pick one of his sons.	2
Drama, on CD?!?! Surely you jest? But jest in case you're not, you might be onto something:)	We haven't had a lot of drama for a long time now but when drama hits on this site then that's when it becomes a Jerry Springer Show because it's like everyone gains up on somebody and the whole place just runs wild.	2

You are right but take the time to watch Dragonballz and you will see who is the strongest.	I watched some Dragonballz last saturday it was goku vs this purple and white dude forgot who his name was a goku was a super sayian	2
The reason why gay marriage is illegal is because are population would decrease	No, I've actually never heard that one before. Homosexuals are a definite minority on the planet, and if they were allowed the same decency and respect as us, the population wouldn't change at all. Even so, we're overpopulated as it is, it wouldn't even be a bad thing.	2
I can agree with that.  I'm quite serious when in a normal state of mind. And I'll debate over anything. :)	I think you need to take a break... you've got problems lol.	2
Just because a male is an adult in physical and mental capacity doesn't mean he will not act a child, and try something to get someone fired. Seen this happen before.	Hopefully anyone who's capable of acting like a child will be quickly fired.	2

You were using my words and interpreted them into something that weren't my own words :)	Yeah, sorry to tell you this, but that is what makes a good lawyer. ;)	2
"Sounds about right to me. Except for the part about a liberal ""entitlement coulture"", that's just stupid. It doesn't make sense to associate living life morally with entitlement. You admit that conservatives hoard everything they can, regardless of the consequences. Tell me again which side feels entitled?"	You rock .	2
In my description I kind of took a side because I really don't see how just letting him have a normal burial could be wrong. He's dead, he can't do any harm anymore. They say he was buried at sea so that his followers wouldn't rise up and make a martyr out of him, but the simple fact that he's dead gives them all the motive they'll need, and maybe more motive because they will never again be near the person they held so much faith in.	I agree yes if they allowed his family to bury him it would run a risk of his followers having a shrine of sorts but if they want to avenge him they will whether he has a grave or not, if anything not allowing his family to bury him runs the risk of creating more militants, his followers could argue that he was right and the west have no respect for Muslims beliefs, it could also cause other members of his family to follow his route to avenge him.	2
You are lucky I do not know how to ban you. I seriously want to ban you. Seriously.	It's okay, all will come in due course. 	2

It is already failing.	Been awhile since I've seen you :/	2
I would agree with you if there weren't so many laws. More and more every year that we become subject to. And so many things we're required to get permission to do.	I'm not really disagreeing with you... I'm all for small government and as few laws as possible.  What annoys me is that there are so many laws and many aren't enforced... like illegal immigration laws. If they would just enforce the rules already on the books the problem would be greatly improved... like going after employers. To the other extreme, I burn brush in my back yard, everyone in my neighborhood does but technically I'm supposed to get a permit for that... it's stupid! But as stupid as it is, if I ever get fined for it I can't really complain because I know the law.  The laws are out of control and getting worse every day, I agree with that. I want our government (especially our federal gov't) to do as little as possible... protect our borders, provide basic services etc.	2
No, Jews still were suggested to not eat pork, gentiles could though, but they already could.	So, he got gentiles to follow him with bacon. No miracles beyond the miracle of bacon were needed.	2
We liked our system over here until Obama brought us change. I would have preferred if he just shipped proponents of Obama care to Britain ;)	What was the change, and the system beforehand?	2
Also, just another point that I just thought of (not sure why it didn't come to me when this debate was created, but oh well). The term 'god' inherently refers to the deity as male, as the term 'goddess' refers to the deity as a female.	Another reason I changed the wording of the title...	2
Jeez what a mood swing	That's Sitara for you. 	2
My question is, how can everyone stay here for such a long time while never winning an argument?	My goal is not to win an argument, my goal is to stir the pot ;)	2
I don't like ranch house type living...I like stairs. It makes me feel I've gotten away from the other part of the house for a while and can be alone if I so desire.	I also like the feeling of getting away from the other part of the house so I got a bigger house ;)	2

"Money is like vegan products...it's a substitute that just can't add up to the real thing. You can't buy love, or happiness. Money is unnecessary,yet we lose sight of what it really is -- paper, and only blind ourselves because we know in this world, and in this ""system"" we have, it is very difficult to live without money, but not impossible -- hell, we did it at the beginning of time, didn't we?"	Exactly, money is a scam. Always has been. It props up certain individuals and damns the rest. There is no love in the world when the world is overtaken by the love for money.	2
I think the biggest problem with people is no one is willing to admitt they are wrong. Even if they are corrected in something, they dodge around the issue by rephrasing the origanal question.	Interesting assessment... I kind of agree with this... the problem is no one can agree with what is wrong and what is right.	2
I'm not sure I completely understand your argument. How dose one sell or find a fetus?	I was using 'it' to refer to his semen. She could get the 'ingredients' to make a baby almost anywhere.	2
How are they the same person? Is Amanda Bynes addicted to hard drugs too?	They have locked Amanda up in a mental institution. She messes up hotel rooms and spends her money like crazy. She is really bad too, and she is constantly compared to Lindsay, so it could go either way.	2
atheism a·the·ism [ey-thee-iz-uhm] noun 1. the doctrine or belief that there is no God. 2. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. ------------------------------------ We can play a dictionary definition game all night if you'd like.	How is this disputing what I said? I said that if you have a god or deity you are a theist. He insisted that due to the definition of atheism that only believing the Christian God counted as being a theist. So I showed him the definitions of the words. Deity, Theism, and atheism.	2
"1) Look, man. I'm not going to rewrite my arguments every time someone asks for them. Look around, I'm too lazy to re write them.  You write your arguments but when people respond saying why they don't work you ignore the responses. If you think your arguments are sound, then you should have no problem responding. You keep saying I have, but never say where, which tbh makes it seem as if you cannot defend your arguments. 2) Philosophical though, I say the evidence for believing in X, Y, Z god(s) is there.  I've responded to your evidence as well as asked you to say how this is evidence, and you continue to fail to respond to that.  3) Regardless of ""well which religion or god(s) is correct."" To be simple, I believe all of them are correct. In that, there are many cultures with different traditions and languages, however, those that believe in the end all believe in the same deity, the same ""god"", as a whole, as one, or many. I have responded to this before saying they have completely different attributes, many of which are contradictory. It is like saying a leprechaun and a vampire are the same. 4) For someone to claim those that do believe are wrong, where is your evidence?  First of all I am not claiming certainty, I say that the existence of a God is highly unlikely. You cannot disprove a negative, but you can show it to be highly unlikely.  One reason I would say it is highly unlikely is because there is an absence of evidence, where evidence should be. An example of this is: If the God answers prayer, prayer should have a measurable effect. We in fact find that the studies show that prayer does not in fact have a measurable effect. These arguments I would say is sufficient to call something unlikely. Prayer is an example, if you tell me the attributes of your God then it is far easier to give arguments. A couple of other reasons I don't believe in a God are: a) I don't believe is because we know from psychology and from history that humans attribute agency where there is none. If you look back through out history at all countless (contradictory) Gods. While this doesn't show that a specific God is false, it does tell us that as a species we have a habit of creating Gods. b) God is superfluous to explaining the universe. Everything we have learnt over the last 400 years, can be explained naturally. God is just an unnecessary assumption.  5) There are many reasons for a person to believe in god(s), and history is evidence as well as many other things, including the beautiful universe.  Can you give an example of historical evidence of God? Also beauty is subjective, what you call beautiful others could call vulgur. We can explain how the complexity (the beauty) of the universe arose from simple natural laws. 6) And so for a person like yourself to continue questioning, sure ask questions, that's fine and encouraged. I agree. 7) However, when it's obvious there is abundant evidence, and you state ""Oh thats not good enough."" Well then I guess its not good enough for you.  This is where i disagree. Just because someone says something is evidence, does not make it evidence. I have said why I think the 'evidence' provided doesn't stand up. If the 'evidence' doesn't stand up, it is not good evidence. 8) And so until any of these spiritual, god(s), or whatever present themselves to you how you want them to, you will continue to not believe. Which is fine.  Well until there is evidence which stands up to scrutiny, I will not believe.  9) There is a fine line between asking questions for the sake of knowledge, versus asking questions just to bash on religious people and tell them ""their evidence is not good enough"".  If anyone provided evidence which I don't think is sound, I will do exactly the same. If the evidence is good it should stand up to scrutiny, it doesn't matter if it is a religious person providing it or a scientist. In science the evidence is scrutinised, to make sure it stands up, this doesn't mean that they are bashing the other scientists does it?  If we don't scrutinise, I cannot see how our understanding can move forward. 10) Move on, you are stagnant. If I seem stagnant, it is only because you have continuously failed to address my points."	Hahahaha. Oh, good one.  {}XXXXXXXX:][:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>	2
You are a total idiot. No way in hell was Hitler a socialist.   Socialism was everything he stood against (such as Stalin).	No way in hell was Hitler a socialist. Socialism: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. Hitler nationalized most of the German economy, that fits the bill. Socialism was everything he stood against Then why was he the leader of the national socialist party? Why did he implement socialist policies? You are a total idiot. Aww the little boy with the single digit IQ score has to resort to name calling.	2
In Brazilian schools there is not a specific subject about sex education. Still, in the humdrum events of daily life, children can watch spicy scenes in a soap-opera, a movie and even in the streets, or see a magazine picture. These situations may obviously provoke a natural curiosity in the children about sex. If there were sex education classes in school, then all the students would get enough information to learn everything they should know about it, so they can have a good and healthy sex life later, when they are ready to. In fact, most parents do not feel comfortable to talk about sex with their children, and neither do the children. The teenagers usually get information only with friends, which is not something reasonable, since they probably rely on what they learnt from television programs, websites and web blogs that are not always reliable. Even if a father or a mother feels open to talk to their son or daughter about sex, they may not have enough recent information about sex or anything related to it. After all, we always have something to learn. For this reason it is necessary to have a well-trained professional who knows how to approach this theme to teenagers and also to their parents, because it is also important to them, since they probably still have doubts. This way, they would know that this subject should be faced seriously and if they can trust the teacher and the school. It might be surprising that in the 21st century students may only get information about sex in Biology or Science classes. It is certainly not enough, since these subjects will not discuss everything related to sex. They usually focus on life matters such as “a baby is made through sexual intercourse between a man and a woman” and teaches about prevention, telling that “AIDS, HPV and syphilis are sexually transmitted diseases, so that is why it is important to always use a condom”. A sex education class would treat and discuss themes like early pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptive methods, menstrual cycle, masturbation, male and female reproductive systems and phases of the human development and of pregnancy. Besides, it is very important for the teacher of this subject to be prepared to deal with possible psychological issues some children may have – such as repression or sex abuse history –, and also the teacher needs to develop discussions about relationships, feelings, emotions and sexual orientation. Some Biology teachers may not be capable of doing this. In countries such as United States or Canada, sex education programs have been in their syllabuses for decades. It is high time Brazil developed special classes to promote a healthy sex education to its youth. Joyce2E & Daniella2E	It is important establish that parents have an important role in the education of their children, but is either important that the subject of sex is discussed elsewhere that the young attend. Sex has been a taboo for several years, but nowadays it’s losing forces, principally to media. Since they are treated in magazines and television, why not in schools? The media is concerned with the market, and how to reach it, and the way sex is approached by them is totally arbitrary. The school role is teach, and in a world of such transformations, teach about sex is instruct the children how to deal with all that arbitrary information as well.  Moreover, children and adolescents are discovering the limits of sexuality in increasingly early age. The instruction without myths and prejudgment given in alliance by the school and parents could be a good way to young people learns to deal with that, improving even the issue about prevention and sexually transmitted diseases.	2

I am a Christian and I am a centrist prochoice progay proreligiousfreedom person who knows for a fact that we are all one human race. Tell me again how close minded I am.	Sadly most Christians aren't as open-mindes as you are. You are one against the majority. Though I do believe with younger generations more Christians are becoming more like you.	2
Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	Looks like Srom is going to be burning with the rest of us.	2
"Humans have many senses beyond the basic or most obvious five senses. The sense of balance is referred to as ""equilibrioception"" and includes both angular momentum acceleration and linear acceleration (i.e. balance and acceleration). ""Thermoception"" is the sense of heat and its absence by the skin. ""Proprioception"" provides brain with information on the relative positions of the parts of the body. ""Nociception"" or the sense of pain alerts the brain to nerve and tissue damage. ""Chronoception"" refers to the perception and experience of time passing. Add to this, there are a number of internal senses which we are unconscious of (e.g.l chemoreceptors in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of suffocation if carbon dioxide levels get too high)."	Very interesting. Thank you.	2
That wasnt even on his radar never came up. Just because he is the son of God, doesn't mean he didn't talk about his dick.	Show where Jesus preached or talked about it in reference to not having to do it.	2

It is high time Brazil developed special classes to promote a healthy sex education to its youth. Joyce2E & Daniella2E	The main point I agree with Joyce's post is the one about phsycological and emotional aspects of sex education. As presented in the post, Brazil's ways of dealing with the subject so far is with biology classes, and that obviously only deals with the physical aspects of the issue.  Sex should not be a tabu anymore in any society. Religion, for example, has made such a big deal of it that even nowadays, in a very modern world, it is still a very delicate subject. There are, and there have always been, many people that do not have a healthy sexual life because of wrong beliefs and wrong ideas about sex, ideas that have been imposed to everyone since a long time and for very convenient reasons. Because of this imposed ideas, people have moral, ethical, psycological and emotional problems corcerning sex.  I do not mean that the physical part is not important, it is. But in my opinion, to have professionals that were able to deal with all these aspects of sexual life would be a very rich gain for teens. This would slowly change people's ways of dealing with sex, would create a more aware society. The frequency of this classes or programs would make the issue more easy and natural to be dealt by teens and would surely bring benefits to individuals and society.	2
Ya i like those too but i love games like gauntlet and zelda	Ah, Legend of Zelda. T'is epic...	2
WTF...no it wouldn't. Five times the modern level of CO2, not O2, would lead to a rise in plant life. I am quoting evolutionary history....stop the bs. I focused a whole year on biblical interpretation and Hebrew source, along with evolution and the big bang.	Dude. Plants start as single celled organisms. They would lead to the rise if humans. That is why you are wrong.	2
It freaked me out a little when I realized the translation.... but Jesus didn't know he was Jesus when he was your age did he? So maybe you are Jesus.... do you talk to bushes?	No I don't talk to bushes and there is actually a plant that lights itself on fire but doesn't burn.	2
Maybe in whichever country you live, but in Britain you can date someone aged 18 from about 14~ there isn't really a limit, just an average of what parents will allow. Legally, you can be in a consensual sexual relationship with anyone provided that you're both over 16.	They have a an exception to the law though. If you want to be together and get married the parents of the minor has to sign papers giving them permission.	2
"Yeah I agree. Though nothing against that kind of music and it is better to have people supporting it rather then that current main stream music. But posting it will not change anyones opinion it is just showing what it is. I would like to say though you can normally not understand what they are saying and it just sounds like somebody kicked them in the balls. The lyrics are not important though I think most just like the loud noise as it gets your adrenalin going or something like that. I am happy getting my adrenaline going with lets say Mozart "" Requiem Dies Irae "". Now this I can twiddle my finger to while I drink a cup of tea and not get scared by the guy with the funny hairstyle."	Exactly. How can one appreciate good lyrics if all they can hear is pounding drums and wailing guitars? I don't see how screaming is a more effective method of portraying lyrics than regular singing, or even just saying them. Although you must admit, Mozart had pretty funny hair too.	2
Where I live it is impossible to get 7% fat milk. We have 0,1, 0,5, 1,0 and 3,0 % I like 1,0% the best. 0,5 and 0,1 are good too - but I can't stand 3,0% .. it's disgusting and .. thick. But I've recently become vegan, so I don't drink milk anymore :)	milk is max 3.5% and that only in summer... why vegan? ...they don't really live long :D	2

Other people being crazy doesn't make you any less crazy, but I like your flavor of crazy ;)	"""Other people being crazy doesn't make you any less crazy"" That's going to resonate around my head for the next few hours. If I wake up in the middle of the night questioning my sanity now, I'm blaming you sweetheart! ;-)"	2
This has nothing to do whit what supports us. I know you have evidence supporting you, I believe those evidence. I just can't understand, why you don't just admit, that this world IS magical no matter how it was created. A scientist should know that better than anyone (if you are one) Make ONE simple little change in the history of the universe, and it would have been a LOT different. Different in a way, that there would never be life. Or something else .. you name it.	"First, this is the second time you have implied that I am scientist, but I never claimed to be one. I have taken science classes, and am associated with scientists in many fields. I love it and study it regularly. But I do not do it for a living.  Anyway: How do you define the word ""magic""?"	2
You weren't bothering me at all.  	I thought I was. Thanks though. :/	2
You're mistaken. I posted more on the other column... but there are many cases to do with the printing pictures of people and this is included in the freedom of expression.  It could be that in Denmark it is illegal to take a picture of someone in the street with their permission. I don't know. The actually taking of the picture isn't to do with freedom of expression - just the printing of it.	Of course, after asking them to delete it. If they refuse to delete, then go ahead and break it.	2
"He was an economic centrist who leaned to right-wing philosophy a lot of the time (hence he had a heavy war on communist Russia as a huge advocate of capitalism). Are you serious? How many times to I have to explain it to you? Socialism: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. Hitler nationalized most of the German economy. Nationalizing means to make something owned by the government. Hitler was not a capitalist in the least.  ""We are not fighting Jewish or Christian capitalism, we are fighting every capitalism."" - Hitler"	JUST BECAUSE HITLER SAID HE IS FIGHTING IT doesn't mean he was telling the truth. Just listen, Hitler liked to have governmental control only when necessary. Once the war was over he was always planning on making a brutally aristocratic state (but this time the aristocrats would be Aryans as opposed to Jews).	2
"Actually, yes. I agree with you. I should and intend to post similar comments about how silly all these ""I hate X user"" posts, including those which are ""I hate Prodigee"". That said, it's to your benefit to ask yourself why are there so many posts which deride you."	It's not fucking up to me. It's up to people to get over themselves. I was only banned because people bullied Andy into doing it.	2
If Hillary doesn't release her tax returns, I will automatically think she's hiding something. What else is there? May after Whitewater she is just spooked but, seriously, IMHO her tax documents are public records if she wants to be POTUS.	I agree, it makes it looks like she's hiding something if she doesn't release them, especially now that Obama has released his returns to the public.	2
"But would it not be a case of ""not knowing better"" to mistakenly think that stealing is beneficial. The thief does not understand theft as doing harm to himself. Presumably if he did, he would not steal"	"The person knows that the stealing is not better in regards to morality, nor for the person being stolen from. However, it is better for the person who is going the stealing. If he knew that it was doing harm to him, then he would not have done it, which is why him doing it is a sign that he thought it was better: better for him and not others; however, he ""knows better"" than to go and steal something, since it is morally wrong."	2

My personal theory is that, culturally, Asians are more studious than personable. Perhaps the most important aspect of getting elected to public office is your personality. At current time, most Asian-Americans still have family members who are very adamant that the family remains traditional. As time goes by, those older generations will die out, and the younger generations will be well educated and very social. There are many Asian-American officials here in California, and specifically the Bay Area.	You don't have to answer publicly if you don't want to, and to my knowledge there is no private message feature, but do you go to Cal?	2

Celsus was a second century philosopher, he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus.  If Jesus's miracles were legit (not just getting people high to make it seem like it, yes I've heard that one but how did he get 10,000+ high at once at the feeding of the 5,000 (men)) who else was he? This is an argument from ignorance, just because you don't know what happened doesn't mean you can jump to the ridiculous unlikely. We don't even know that those events occurred.	just because you don't know what happened doesn't mean you can jump to the ridiculous unlikely Why would the Jews follow him if his miracles didn't happen? Their were many self proclaimed Jesuses before and after, but only Jesus of Nazereth moved the Jews to the point of conversion.	2

Of course a guilty person would say that silly thing. Or is it the truth? How do we know? Oh yes. We dont. See how stupid this is? Now take this stupid and apply it to Lizzie and Abby. Its still stupid.	It takes stupid to know stupid, and you seem to know stupid so...	2
I made this argument before. fond memories. Cartman now dislikes me because of it :) Ja I would say so. A living thing must be made mostly of living respiring cells.  Done.	"You didn't make this argument before, right? You only talked about existing, not living. But, Cartman doesn't like you when you post a challenge that you get upset with people for joining in on. Cartman doesn't really care about your opinion on existence and doesn't hold it against you. Cartman speaks in 3rd person therefore Cartman exists. Cartman hopes you enjoyed the ""disputed."""	2
It should be Manslaughter, I think. Each of us has the ability to engage in a crime of passion and I don't believe we are hardened criminals that would kill again. It IS, I believe, a temporary insanity.	Temporary insanity, sounds reasonable! But if someone has the willpower to kill someone they love doesn't that mean that they have the willpower to kill a stranger?	2
They were basically equal in any regards of actual power. Dictators have powerful armies, so do kings. I only see being able to pick your heir as a major decider of which is better. It's better for the next generation.	An absolute monarch had much more structure in its power. The divine right was passed down by heritage keeping that belief strong. This opens your span of control.	2
Actually as a policeman your job is to apprehend criminals and turn them over to the courts and the courts punish them. As a policeman you are not allowed to use your force as a tool of retribution your only allowed to use the amount of force that is nessisary what they tell us in the cadet program and criminal justice class is the minimal amount nessisary is the maximum amount of force allowed to make an arrest.	Thank you. .	2
OK, makes sense I guess. This next part isn't an argument its a genuine question, what is that higher state?	"My Buddhist studies are about a good year or two behind me now, but my recollection is that the higher state (not sure ""higher"" is even the word I should have used but that's the gist) is one of transcendence from being an individual self to being a collective which exists on a different plane away from suffering. In a sense, sort of a Buddhist collectivist heaven if that helps to think of it."	2
"You substitute ""ness"" words for bigger words in English?"	'Smartness' just sounds kind of childish...	2
What would you do then?  You're told to either shoot 5 people your self and save 10 others, or save those five people and allow someone else to shoot 10 people as you watch.	It's a good question and difficult morally isn't it , a lot of tough decisions either way	2

You can pass the test without any need for originality. Term papers are written with facts, not fancy words.	The test bit had nothing to do with my point, I just try not to edit definitions I post. Having knowledge or being 'smart' doesn't require creativity; however,  (2) : the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly, does require creativity.  P.S. I write all my term papers (eloquently, I might add) with fancy words.	2
I don't mind if they do... it actually makes sense, especially if they're taking part in a different holiday around that time, but this isn't about people putting a religious label on a celebration... it's about people trying to take away a religious term out of a religious holiday, yet still celebrating it the same way (minus going to church and so on). I guess what I'm trying to say is that after you decorate your Christmas tree and put up your Christmas lights while listening to Christmas music, it seems kind of unnecessary to ditch the term when referring to the actual event.	I am obliged to agree .	2
"Interesting.... I missed this debate somehow? I really never was a ""birther""... I can't stand our POS POTUS but I never really questioned his being born in Hawaii and since you posted this he has provided his alleged long version birth certificate...  Having said that... Yes, if Barry or any POTUS got into their position knowing that they weren't eligible, then they should be tried and if found guilty given the death penalty as well as any co-conspirators. That would qualify as treason to me... as long as they were a US citizen."	It is interesting to note that his birth certificate ( that he spent millions to NOT release) bears little resemblance to an ACTUAL long form certificate from that era. There are also descrepencies within the wording itself, such listing his father as African( during that time it would have been Black or negro) among others. You'd think the cheap son of a bitch would have spent a few more bucks and gotten a better forgery done LOL	2
"I believe man and women were made divenly but the rest of creation was evolved. Man did not have enough time to make the intelligence leap needed even on the most recent and closest homo-sapien relative given by carbon dating. The Bible says the forms of life came from the water, and the land. Each cstoagory of animal came ""after his kind"". The actual or literal Hebrew to English translation us by means of or agency of succeeding species. Evolution is an evolution of a species to another, but the evolution is kept within the species. Their comes a point where the great x 20 grandfather is a different species, but the current and next generation are the same. The bible basically says evolution with a combination of life coming from the water and land and the literal translation of aftrr their kind. Also the Hebrew word for day, bara, can mean an unspecified amount of time."	"The bible is never specific as to what it implies. However the connotatuon given is not evolution, but divine spawning of inhabitant creatures.  ""And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being"" Genesis 2:7 By analyzing the syntax we can assume that God made Adam from dust, and not by evolutionary circumstances. God made Adam dead. He was just a cadaver. God ""breathed"" life into him and he was created. I would imagine God doing the same for all animals. Actually I am positive he performed the same act of the divine uprising of life. They were created from dust. Earth material. Also if you are a Evolutionist Christian you are denying the fact that death comes as a result of sin. If evolution is true then death already existed."	2

Atheism is not a religion. Yes, it is human nature to ascribe agents in the form of anthropomorphic causes, but there is nothing wrong with overcoming primitive instincts in favour of another facet of our nature: scientific curiosity. By your logic we should carry on looking for the monsters in our cupboards because thinking there are nearby predators when you are in the dark is human nature, and therefore not looking for the monsters every night is to deny one's own human nature. Instead, we look in the cupboard, realise there is no monster, and go back to sleep. And you're telling me that is the irrational course of action.	"Atheism is not a religion. Eh... That is disputable. I personally believe that atheism is a religion, since the definition of religion is, ""a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe,"" and since all atheists believe in an alternative theory of the universe to God, thus atheism is a religion."	2
"Oh c'mon! I thought the whole ""Ghost"" gag on the other side evened things up a bit. I'm now neutral, so I think I deserve that back. Bah humbug."	Don't worry, I've overlooked many more obvious things before, I just felt the need to say why I left that one. And it was kind of funny that you took him seriously, to be honest.	2
No, that's just one of the many things that can go wrong. Just because you do well in bed doesn't mean you're good at keeping your vows.	True, honesty and comitment are also key to a healthy relationship.	2
"If none of the answers you come up with line up, the proper response is ""I don't know"", not, he is the son of God, broke the laws of physics, raised a zombie army, resurrected, appeared as a ghost, and will return to Earth in the second coming."	No, the son of God is the only one that fits. His miracles cannot be denied by historians or philosophers of the time. The only reason he would've been followed by the Jews the way they did were if they saw his miracles and how he healed people physically, emotionally, and spiritually. He was the son of God because the demons themselves called him so.	2
Dictatorial rule is what I prefer. I think they make much better rulers .	Well said, I don't like Monarchs, they're a lot lazier and generally do less. Dictators are more are far more ambitious in their quest for world domination! Until they get found cowering in a sewer pipe ( twice...)	2
Xbox is way better because (DuskinFire I know you are a Minecraft fan) on the Xbox Live Marketplace you can buy downloadable content new games and clothes and accessories for your avatar you create when you first ge your Xbox.

You think that aliens invaded the Earth and trapped our souls? Wow, someone needs to be checked in to a mental institution.	2
I wouldn't go for the death penalty just because of the crime, I'd go with it on the likelihood it was to happen again. If he can be rehabilitated, then there's no reason for the death penalty, but as it appears he can't. After getting out of Jail, he went and did a crime worse than the original, and as I read the article it seemed he wasn't guilty at all. Guilty in the emotional sense. There's no hope for guys like that, and wasting tax dollars to house and feed him isn't going to do anyone any good.	"You had me worried for a second. and as I read the article it seemed he wasn't guilty at all. Maybe could be ""he didn't show guilt."" Your assessment seems accurate. No guilt whatsoever."	2

Surely that is a bad idea. Government cannot be trusted! Is it not already quite obvious that power corrupts? Government has power. Government is corrupt. Now, think about the most corrupt government possible - in control of the entire world. Conclusion: To say that a government in control of entire world is stupid, is an understatement.	"""Surely that is a bad idea. Government cannot be trusted!"" and chances are they'll stick some fancy politician with the title President of the planet or something"	2

I am going back and remember these debates I made years ago lol.	Did no one respond to them years ago?  	2
"Ahaha, yes, you do. Perhaps not all Christians, but it's a poor excuse to say ""I don't hate them, I just feel it's wrong. Some of my best friends are gay, I just disapprove of what they do."" That's the same as hatred. Worse even, because of how much extra pain it causes."	Ok, so theoretically if you have a kid... and he one day does something that you think it bad such as cheating on a test... or stealing a car... would you hate him? No! you would disapprove of the actions that he did and probably punish him, but not hate him! And yes, I do have several gay friends, and we have discussions about Christianity and everything! I dont hate them at all! Just like I dont hate the sexually immoral, even though I think its wrong!	2
"Yeah, this is a really dumb debate.  I mean, people we know are going to die whether we're alive at the time or not. Like, me dying won't magically make someone else not die. So if given the choice, why the hell wouldn't you want to live? Please, ""seeing the ones we love die, wah!"" lame. I wonder if anyone else sees how incredibly self-centered this debate really is? Think about it. The idea is, the people who would like to die now want to do so in order to avoid facing the death of others. Meanwhile, we know the death of others is inevitable. Everyone dies. So what's the point whether you're around to see it or not? Are you so important, or such a martyr, that you're too special to have to go through that pain? What's so great about you, that you shouldn't have to go through what everyone else does? Of course given the choice, almost everyone will choose to live forever, I suspect even those who say they would not. Get over yourselves, and you'll get over people you know are going to die as well."	You're right. Choosing to live forever means watching everyone you love and everything you know pass away. Not a good choice, as I said.	2
Yeah... I wanted that to be an option but until Andy gives us three way debates... I'm at a loss.	Omg that should seriously be a thing :D	2
yeah. that too. might as well just get a new car at that point.	Yeah I guess so.	2

Speaking of Hebrew words: in 2 Samuel 1:26, the same word used to describe the love between David and Jonathan is used to describe the love between David and women plus the fact that Jonathan's love surpasseth the love of women.	irst, the Hebrew word for “love” used here is not the typical word used for sexual activity. This word for “love” has clear political and diplomatic connotations (see 1 Samuel 16:21 and 1 Kings 5:1). Second, David’s comparison of his relationship with Jonathan with that of women is probably a reference to his experience with King Saul’s daughter. He was promised one of Saul’s daughters for killing Goliath. But Saul continued to add conditions upon this marriage with the underlying desire to have David killed in battle (1 Samuel 18:17, 25). The love David had received from Jonathan was greater than anything he could have received from Saul’s daughter. Third, the Bible clearly and consistently denounces homosexuality (Genesis 1:26-27; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:18-25). Extolling a homosexual love between David and Jonathan would be contradicting the prohibitions of it found throughout the Bible. The friendship between David and Jonathan was a covenantal relationship. In 1 Samuel 18:1-5, we read of David and Jonathan forming an agreement. In this agreement, Jonathan was to be second in command in David’s future reign, and David was to protect Jonathan’s family (1 Samuel 20:16-17, 42; 23:16-18). Obviously, these two men were also very good friends. In their relationship we can see at least three qualities of true friendship. First, they sacrificed for one another. In 1 Samuel 18:4, we read that Jonathan gave David his clothes and military garb. The significance of this gift was that Jonathan recognized that David would one day be king of Israel. Rather than being envious or jealous, Jonathan submitted to God’s will and sacrificed his own right to the throne. Second, in 1 Samuel 19:1-3, we read of Jonathan’s loyalty toward and defense of David. King Saul told his followers to kill David. Jonathan rebuked his father and recalled David’s faithfulness to him in killing Goliath. Finally, Jonathan and David were also free to express their emotions with one another. In 1 Samuel 20, we read of a plan concocted by Jonathan to reveal his father’s plans toward David. Jonathan was going to practice his archery. If he told his servant that the arrows he shot were to the side of the target, David was safe. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were beyond the target, David was to leave and not return. Jonathan told the servant that the arrows were beyond the target, meaning that David should flee. After releasing his servant, Jonathan found David and the two men cried together. Rather than being evidence for a homosexual relationship in the Bible, the account of David and Jonathan is an example of true biblical friendship. True friendship, according to the Bible, involves loyalty, sacrifice, compromise, and yes, emotional attachment. That is what we should learn from David and Jonathan. The idea that the only person in the Bible described as “a man after God’s own heart” (Acts 13:22), was a practicing homosexual (or bisexual) is ridiculous and has no true biblical basis.

So, you believe all of the right things, but you draw the wrong conclusion. What does that say about you?	That no matter how much money you have if it does control you you aren't strong enough for it.	2

No! Give them a simple telephone that only dials 911 if they need it. And even that is going too far. For the love of all that's holy, let them string two cans together and play outside, explore etc... Quit letting technology parent your children cause you're too lazy or unwilling.	I kinda agree with you. Children don't need smartphones really, just like they don't need Facebook accounts or laptops at that age. However, if parents feel they must have a phone, then it should a simple one, not something absolutely extraordinaire.	2
Yeah, but you can't attack the flaws of religion in general, you have to address the individual.	Oh, I didn't know that .	2
"First, this is the second time you have implied that I am scientist, but I never claimed to be one. I have taken science classes, and am associated with scientists in many fields. I love it and study it regularly. But I do not do it for a living.  Anyway: How do you define the word ""magic""?"	Oh sorry :) But I guess its a compliment to be called a scientist when you're not right ;) Probably not by a 17 year old girl. But the reason why I did is because .. almost everyone I debated on here who are atheists are also scientist. Sorry though :) I guess I used the wrong word. Magic is not it.. Magical is a proper word. The universe is magical .. how can you not think that?! You have to be seriously depressed to not think that ;p Because seriously.. watch a documentary about the history of the universe. It's so amazingly ridiculously beautiful.	2
True. But if your have too open a mind, your brains fall out ;)	Very true, I've met a few of them as well as the ones whose minds are so closed they've crushed their brains and we have them all in this little online community	2

How is the prisoner's dilemma resolved? Can the prisoners talk to each other and agree not to confess? That would be like countries signing a treaty not to stockpile nukes.	No, the two prisoners can't discuss together. They only have the same level of reasoning and will only do what they believe to be most beneficial to themselves. If one thought that the other person was not going to confess, then it is still in their best interests to confess (as thy then get to go immediately).  The same can be applied to a signing of treaty, as soon as a country knows that everyone else is going to get rid of their nuclear weapons then it is within their best interests to keep hold of their own.	2
Why do you think we even need a separation of church and state?	Well for a start the idea of a Theocracy is stupid because how do you even know that your religion or church is the correct one (if any are). Laws should be based of reason not what is written down in a grossly outdated book which states a number of things that have no evidence to support and plenty against it.	2

No, I'm not misunderstanding you, here. How is it magic to reject magic? That's all atheism is.  Also, what's my religion? I wasn't aware I had one.	If you say you don't have a religion, you don't. It is magic to reject, that this world was made by some kind of miracle. I mean think about it - if .. protein wasn't made under big bang - no life in the universe could ever be. If water somehow wasn't made - no life on earth or anywhere else in the universe would be. I could go on .. if we never had oxygen, an atmosphere, clouds, a sun or if we remove all the natural disasters like volcano's breaking out, tsunamis and earth quakes ... if remove ALL of those happened through time before human was created - Humans probably never would have been made. No tell me - how is it NOT a miracle, that miraculously - everything just fits into our needs?	2
Tits? Did someone say tits? I'm all for tits ; )	Lol, check out google? And the old site I used was full of guys, and girls, all trying to get someone to post tits. I'd always tease and just do bra pictures, no way in hell they're seeing them for free. XD They have to pay like everyone else.	2

Racism is the symptom, not the disease. That may be true, but if you can't cure the whole disease yet, it's definitely better to aid the symptoms for the time being. A tax credit would be like Tylenol for a brain tumor. More like ibuprofen for a broken leg. It'll keep things from hurting while you wait to actually fix the problem. Humans are social creatures, of they start getting together they will start finding things to like about one another and will get along eventually. Just like how kids in high school make friends, and how siblings get along.	Perhaps we don't agree on what the disease actually is. Clarify that and we will clarify how to treat the symptoms.  What do you think is the cause of racism?	2
The Stalinists did some terrible things, but they were not as bad as the fascists. Some or the caps were the same, but it depends on which ones and which time period.	Hitler was the 3rd biggest mass murderer in history, Stalin was the 2nd biggest mass murderer in history.	2
Intangible. I am just considering never responding to him, but that would be rude. I just can't seem to pry an actual argument off of him.	Replying to Intangible is pointless. He doesn't make sense most of the time and just spouts off a bunch of glibberty-glock. If he's wrong about something he's too weak too admit it so he just tries to change the subject. It's best to just ignore him as he just feeds on the attention.	2
I want to live my life as I please. Religion is like an extreme version of the society I must live in. More rules, more regulations, less freedom.	So it's better to just kill anyone you don't like?	2

Should we change our pictures for Halloween? ;)	I like that idea! I'm going to try changing mine to something more old sc-ghoul for the occasion, LOL	2
Yes, but if God is not real, then then we ARE the ones to decide what is good and bad. In fact, even if there was a god, why in the world would he be the god from the Bible? We already know the Bible is wrong. Genesis is wrong. If God lied about one thing, why would I believe anything else in it? If God had clearly stated exactly how the universe worked, along with quantum physics and Earth orbiting a star, if he had mentioned all the different galaxies and stars, if he had given us science regarding evolution or the Higgs Boson particle, then perhaps it would seem more authentic. Instead, the Bible is contradicted by modern science. Modern science is not wrong because it is based on evidence, not myths. Not to mention the Bible endorses slavery. If you feel gayness is worse than slavery, then you are truly corrupted.	This discussion is about whether Christians hate gays or not.... I have said that we don't, you can continue ranting or not... but I have shown you that being gay is not safe... I am done, unless you would like to start another discussion.... Who says that Genesis is wrong? Do you know anyone that has been there? Second, who says that slavery is wrong? We are all slaves! Either to wickedness or righteousness, we all serve our master!	2

"You're right I should have clarified, bitchy to guys. And yes it is evident, I mean my ex wouldn't shut up about it. One week she's fine the next "" Andrew don't fucking joke with me I'm NOT IN THE MOOD.""  I mean where else would that come from, on a monthly basis. I mean It's possible a member of her family dies every month, but.... And that's one example. And besides, you expect that guys would be bitchy if they bled outta their dicks every month, you say it as though you're saying "" Guys complain that girls are bitchy, but wouldn't men be as well"" as if to say "" Girls are bitchy, but guys would be as well."" I would relate. Fortunately I do not have to..! So you have in your wording told us already that you think girls are bitchy on their period.   Don't become a lawyer."	I mean where else would that come from uhm... let me think. Maybe she IS a bitch :) Bitches bitch. So you have in your wording told us already that you think girls are bitchy on their period.  No I didn't say that in my own words. That was your interpretation of what I said :) Don't become a lawyer. I would say that to you too, since you take interpretations as evidence.	2
So does everyone. Every scientist agrees with you and so do i. However, where we differ is where you and other theists want to call it a conscious being and we want to find out exactly what IT is through science.	You sound more like a pantheist than an atheist to me, but that is just my opinion.	2
Well, UHC has been cast as merely a policy. Abortion too is a policy, but it has theological aspects. UHC is not principally an economic issue - it's a moral one. UHC too could win moral if not theological appeal if it were properly spinned. Helping 47 million gain access to better health certainly isn't an evil thing. And how isn't caring for the health of others not too a matter of one's soul and existence? True, social conservatives say little now about UHC. They should certainly say something about UHC, if they are opposed to it or willing to vote against it. Shouldn't one's belief in God's omnibenevolence lead a social conservative to believe that UHC would be a policy that would fit within their beliefs? Setting aside taxes (and that's admittedly a tall order), why is there a knee jerk reaction amongst Republicans against UHC? More broadly, if the GOP is truly the party of social values, why do they consistently pledge to cut social programs?  Taxes suck. I get it. But taxing the rich wouldn't offset their lifestyles. They will still have more than everyone else. And if the preponderant financial burden is not on the middle and lower classes, then taxes don't really affect them. Having access to affordable health care would.	"Every policy decision has moral implications, but favouring socialism over market-based care coverage is an economic question in response to a moral obligation: which system delivers the best health care with the least negative repercussions to the most people. Universal health care delivers to everyone, but compromises quality and technological innovation, as well as takes away certain liberties. Free Market health care delivers health care to those who want it with low costs and high quality with no violation of liberty. (The current system is not free market). This is why we have market socialists who want absolute equality through the market. So you see it's much more complicated than ""it's right to give people health care,"" which to me sounds like the road to hell being paved with good intentions. Conservatives cut public spending and welfare programs because they contend they do more harm than good, and that there are practical and ethical alternatives. Welfare is a good example. Welfare in my country Canada is essentially a racist policy. It's been keeping stagnant our poorest population, the natives. Similar things happened in the US with the black communities. It wasn't until Welfare Reform (a cut in social spending) that things got better. There was lots of opposition by liberals, but now they virtually all agree that welfare reform was one of the most successful policies to eliminate poverty ever in the US.  This is igniting a different debate, though. Conservatives, like liberals, want the best for people in society. They just have different theoretical approaches to it. The main point rests. There is no explicit theological commitment to socialist, feudal, free-market, Keynesian, or any other modern idea, unlike the soul which is a central tenet."	2

Why don't they just have reserve armies that mobilize during war?	Well we need some actively waiting to intercept any potential threats. We have to be able to have an immediate reaction if a nation decides to attack.	2
"No, atheism is the antithesis of theism and incongruent with religion.  The rant image attached to this debate is also a reactionary and inaccurate representation of atheism. For instance, it is not ""ironic"" or ""self-defeating"" to use reason (def: logic) to argue that there is no reason (def: universal or god-driven purpose) for life.  As far as morality goes, religion is certainly no better and quite arguably worse in its absolute arbitrariness. An atheistic approach actually considers reasons for certain practices and their implications upon the well-being of others. Sure, they are still constructed by humans but I would choose an intentional moral construct over an arbitrary one any day. I also do not judge others for having different morals or views; I judge people for clinging to morals or views which are antiquated and contradicted by known facts. I do not think that I am right about everything, but I do think that my process of arriving at my thoughts and beliefs is objectively preferable to the theistic approach."	This. The fact that Atheism is a religion is a misconception. It is a lack in the belief of a deity. Forms of Buddhism, I believe are a form of Atheism.  People for some reason believe being atheist means you have no morals, which is incorrect..	2
Murderers, paedophiles, rapists and such scum only, though. And there has to be no doubt that they're guilty.	There is a silver lining even if we make mistakes and take out a few innocents..., fewer people out during rush hour traffic. That has to count for something ;)	2

"Really?! Post the next verse please!!!! Vs. 25. And yes, the earth brought forth life. Not god forming. Life came from the ground and species appeared ""after their kind"". No water is mentioned. Life was created out of the water the ""day"" before. Life appeared on earth then life appeared on land, exactly like evolution."	"Verse 24 and 25 contradict immediately.  ""And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."" This is Verse 24.  ""And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good."" Verse 25.  WTF?  Clearly either all are of his kind or the cattle are excluded. Either way you still are incorrect.  And yes, the earth brought forth life. Not god forming. Life came from the ground and species appeared ""after their kind"".  The verses don't support you. Only the Cattle do.  No water is mentioned. Life was created out of the water the ""day"" before. Life appeared on earth then life appeared on land, exactly like evolution.  Oh I missed that. So God made them from water and spawned them. Still doesn't follow evolution since only the cattle came from themselves. It's illogical. You know how evolution also doesn't apply in the bible? How does grass grow or any plany before the sun existed? It would be freezing. Grass grew before any photons hit them. That makes no sense."	2

Whenever I try to play old games I get super bored super quickly. Modern games are usually more fast paced. It's annoying how some of them have those unskippable cut scenes where you're just turning your head in a ship or something, but once the action starts it's usually just a bunch of play time. Old games are missing so many elements in modern games. It's like using Windows 95.	Personally I disagree but I respect your opinion.	2
"To be specific, Hitler stopped Hitler. Germany could have beaten Russia, however, Stalin began to give his generals power and allow them to fight the battles strategically. Hitler ignored most of his general's advice and made terrible decisions. And when Stalin ""stopped Hitler"" what did he do? Did he liberate the oppressed areas? Did he make their lives better? Nope, it was just like exchanging one dictator for another."	Well, I won't dis agree that Hitler stopped Hitler, but the wall of Katusha rockets put up by the Red Army had something to do with it. The Liberation of Europe by the USSR did make the lives of people in those areas marginally better, but after Stalin's death things really improved.	2

"I don't need to live however I choose to be alive, so what does that matter?  People make choices, that's obvious. Aren't we passed that?  I understand humans ""owe"" horses, due to exactly what you've presented as evidence for in terms of war and what not. I actually believe horses are one of the ""prettiest"" ""most beautiful"" animals I've ever seen.  When he says ""To all animal activists, fuck you."" That makes is personal from him to animal activists. It also makes it look bad for those whom eat meat because perhaps it makes it seem like all meat eaters feel that way. Well, I'm a meat eater, I do not feel the same way. I do not say ""fuck you"" to activists for I believe it's rude and disrespectful to non meat eaters.  However, what he did was probably more ""humane"" than how many companies destroy cattle slaughtering them making them suffer.  I agree that animals should not have to suffer, however, humans are omnivores and do eat meat and eat vegetables and non meat consumption.  As far as slaves go, you basically and essentially compared black slaves to horses. Why is that? You've already mentioned how you hold humans and horses to be the same, however, why pin point black slaves? What's the point in that? I'm not stating you're racist, at all. It's just a bad comparison in my opinion.. To use the selfishness and retarded-ness of humans having humans slaves (in the wrong), compared to an human killing another human (in the right) so that they can eat meet."	I could have chosen any number of oppressed people, it just seemed like the best situational comparison as people did not seem to think them sentient, or care if they were sentient. You might just want to check that last sentence, although cannibalism is perfectly natural, if disgusting cruel and slightly evil.	2
Ho, ho, ho! Well, if it isn't fat stinking billy goat Billy Boy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip oil?

That's right, all criminals get their guns through legal means right now, so more laws will work.	I know right. So true. The problem is that people think criminals just get their weapons legally and fairly.	2
"There is a very important clause in the Bill of Rights called ""the free exercise thereof"". Basically, the government cannot pass a bill that specifically prohibits the exercise of a religion, which is exactly what you are saying."	Keep in mind that the exercising of the religion must not affect people around them that wish to not be disturbed by it. If in any case the exercise becomes oppressive or highly distracting to others and inherently prevents on from doing what they wish in their current state then I would say it is right to prohibit the exercise of religion for the individual(s).	2
I have yet to mention my PhDs in this debate, I have no idea who you are and I feel that for reason unknown you are attempting to mock my position.  If you are not going to take part in this debate properly, then i'm afraid I may have to ban you.	Okay Mickey Mouse.	2
I say USAian because calling them Americans seems so politically incorrect to me. :/ I say estadounidense in Spanish.	"The term USAian had never occurred to me before; but I must say I dig it.

Not at all. I am just saddened about what Abby said to me. You did the right thing.	2
That's what I'm saying lol, there is no way in hell they will ever hold higher office with people like this lol, I feel kind of bad in a way because they are just making all religious republican look bad, did you know just a few weeks ago, in the state of Maine 13 republican representatives left the republican party, they said it was because of shit like this. The racist fundamentalist redneck Christians hijacked the republican party lol, so in a nut shell the republican party got hijacked by the KKK 2.0 lol, I'm even starting to see some of the Libertarian party starting to get infiltrated by those whack jobs like Alex Jones lol.	Well I mainly feel enraged at these fucking assholes I don't feel that they deserve sympathy what so ever lol I really do like watching shit like this because the more I do the more loathe these bastards and I love it!	2
"Wow, you are one of the scariest debaters on here. I literally fear a response from you at the risk of being served. I read all of this and the ending summary really helped. I agree that everyone spending will help the economy, only if there is money to be spent. Which is where, I guess the question comes up, ""Who starts the cycle? The business owners or the people."""	"Thank you :) Though fear is not really my goal. Which is where, I guess the question comes up, ""Who starts the cycle? The business owners or the people."" If someone does not invent something than one would never know they ""need"" it, mostly. Sometimes ""necessity is the mother of invention"" but that's in extreme circumstances like war, natural disaster, etc, usually people will coast along fine without specific things created. So when you are talking about specific things which are not literally necessities (food, water, shelter) it is a person or group of people who start the cycle. So masses with the ability to purchase create a climate where specific cycles of spending can improve an economy. Without the ability to purchase, things can still be invented and do well, but only at the cost of other things. So iPhones sell great say in this scenario, creating jobs etc (let's ignore where and keep everything simple), but if those buying the iPhone are then going without something else, it is a zero sum game in terms of helping the economy, because those jobs weren't ""created"" in that case, they just shifted from wherever to making iPhones."	2
Which is why if you are immortal you would be able to leave this planet quite easily. 	Seriously. Immortal, maybe you could just chop yourself up into tiny bits. Or eat your own brain. Hmmm. Now I'm trying to plan how to kill an immortal. Why, brain, why.	2
no, we have free will, the entire family did not die because of the gangsters actions, yes the mother and infant died due to the extreme tragedy, but the father didnt have to commit suicide	If ganster hadn't kidnapped the child, then it is likely that none of the family would have died.	2
I came up with this debate because my friend who is a girl told me to watch Pretty Little Liars to see if I would like it or not. She is into it a lot and it's one of her favorite shows. Plus I know most girls in my school watch it too. I have watched parts of the 1st episode and I think it's good that's why I am asking. And no I don't watch My Little Pony just because I made that debate about it.	Hey man, you might want to consider what it means if your friend, who is also a girl, recommends 'Pretty Little Liars', to you.  Regardless of any upbringing, the heart wants what it wants and that can't be wrong.	2
ok, but i do not see anything. ???  	Check again. I just got done posting. ;'(	2
I don't know really what a proper solution would be. I just know making everyone the same isn't really a solution. Imagine if we did succeed making everyone the same, and suddenly a totally different person is born. Then there would be racism against him, right? So you haven't really solved the problem. It's like instead of fixing the real problem you're just covering it up or hiding it. But like I said, I don't know any proper way to erase racism.	There will always be differences. But, if 90% of what you do and what you are are similar enough, no one will really care about the differences.  We can never get rid of discrimination, though, that's impossible.	2
Sounds like poltergeist activity!	I wish. I always found poltergeists amusing, not that I've had any first hand account. It gives me this ray of hope that when I die I'll still have a chance to screw with people. - The bottom line is that there will always be paranormal activity. As these occurences become sciences, there are sure to be more absurd ones come time.	2
1. He can move much faster which means he can generate much more force behind his already powerful blows.  2. I've never seen superman punch someone through a mountain.	Though I take no official position. In regards to your second point, in Superman's defense their is rarely a mountain written into his scenery. Though, and I'm not calling it equal just worthy of mention, he has punched villains through buildings and into the ground.	2
"I'm clarifying your argument so as to avoid casting a vote to either side of this horribly skewed debate. Can't vote for either; the choices come down to GAY or essentially ""Almost Gay."" That is complete bullshit and you should be ashamed for posting a debate like this. Back on topic- last time I checked, whether or not someone was gay, straight, or bi, depended on their relative level of attraction towards the same sex and the opposite sex. The entertainment they partake in, while it may be correlated (even strongly correlated) with one sexual orientation or the other, does not imply ANYTHING regarding their sexuality. Not a fan of the show myself, but really- grow up."	The entertainment they partake in, while it may be correlated (even strongly correlated) with one sexual orientation Bingo. Ie: GAYYYYYYYYY	2
It depends on peope's perspective, but not to everyone they are discriminated.

"It also says; ""Even if you don't believe in this religion, would you have a problem with it?"" Like what I said, this isnt a debate about God's existence"	It does say if you would object, and he may object to the religion on a personal level due to stated reasons above. I read object as meaning not being something you'd believe, with the question being a follow up question. In any case most atheists object to the debate creators idea of a reasonable religion due to it being illogical.	2

"Not agreeing with you on everything does not mean that I fail to see the point. Is there a particular reason you're being so abrasive? I mean, are you even reading these, or are you just skimming them and knee-jerking to whatever jumps out at you? That seems like a good way to miss the point fairly frequently, as well as a way to take any given debate off on some ridiculous tangent- not that I'm at all innocent of that, mind you. I'd say you miss points at least as often as I do. Are you suggesting that the sentence ""If they want to pray at work, they can do so durning lunch or breaks. The same goes for students at school"" implied that this was just an ok time? Because it really looks to me like it's intended more as a limitation. I could be wrong there, though, I'll grant you. And you're right, I probably went on about it longer than I needed to, and I probably could have summed it up in one or two lines- certainly not JUST the last line as written, though, as it doesn't properly represent my position on the subject. You and I both know that I tend towards being overly wordy- that's not likely to stop either, I'm afraid. Sorry if that irritates you."	Not agreeing with you on everything does not mean that I fail to see the point. Right, failing to see the point was when you failed to see the point. I don't understand why you argue with people you agree with I guess. I mean, are you even reading these Your stuff is unreadable. You spent an entire paragraph discussing something that was summed up in the first and last sentence. hat seems like a good way to miss the point fairly frequently, as well as a way to take any given debate off on some ridiculous tangent- not that I'm at all innocent of that, mind you.

uh, this is senseless. By that logic you should off yourself now no matter how long you might live.

"Well I've seen about 8 episodes now, many of these addictions are almost certainly fatal. listening carefully to what is being said during the episodes, there is inconsitancies with the descriptions of their addictions and habbits throughout the episode. example: ""Natasha's addiction started 7 years ago when she started eating chalk, 2 years later she started eating dry wall"" Later in the episode: ""Natasha has been eating Dry Wall for 7 years"" This show may have some real cases of addiction, but for certain some of these are not real."	What is the probability of someone finding a person eating the ashes of her husband and getting permission and chance of broadcasting it to the masses?Some of the cases may be real, but most of them aren't.I can say the one with the inhaling mothballs could be real because i used to do that as a child, but not as the woman doing it in the show,I just liked to smell a sealed box of mothballs.

If I am going to be consistent with what I am saying I could equally call a stone a form of life AND a form of non-life  Yes you would have to and you would be wrong in doing so. Living and nonliving do not logically mean the same thing. They are equivalent in existing, but not equal to each other in living...because a stone has no life... so why use it in the first place? To show that there is a difference between a rock and a person or a dog and a T.V. To show that if it's alive, then it can die. for biological reasons...to describe what you are dealing with...	I think I am quitting this round. If you are still interested in understanding my position I suggest you read my answers again: They contain everything you need in order to understand me.	2
A privatized military would be a disaster. Private militaries wouldn't have any ethical obligations. They wouldn't be bound to any codes of war. Instead, they would just be motivated by profit margins. Additionally, the federal government's military would have trouble controlling the private militaries. So many problems could arise here, I don't want to enumerate them.	I can see it now. Walmart wages war against China, The Dow Jones Militia storms D.C., Enron annexes Alaska. - Everything goes down the drain. Ad campaigns would resemble Nazi propoganda	2

Ah, Pascals Wager. True if god exist then the atheist are paying a heavy price.

That was the exact point I was going to bring up!!!!! Well said	2

There is more than one kind of atheist. I'm not a fan of Richard Dawkins, I actually think he's kind of a prick, but the belief scale he describes helps clarify things. 1 · Strong Theist: I do not question the existence of God, I KNOW he exists. 2 · De-facto Theist: I cannot know for certain but I strongly believe in God and I live my life on the assumption that he is there. 3 · Weak Theist: I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God. 4 · Pure Agnostic: God’s existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable. 5 · Weak Atheist: I do not know whether God exists but I’m inclined to be skeptical. 6 · De-facto Atheist: I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable and I live my life under the assumption that he is not there. 7 · Strong Atheist: I am 100% sure that there is no God. Most of the atheists I've met consider themselves a 5 or 6. The atheists you are referring to are a 7 on that scale. I don't think many atheists would rate themselves a 7, but I'll see if I can find some statistics on that. Even Dawkin's himself said he's only a 6. I agree with you that anyone claiming to be a 7 is not being open minded.	"Either way, the guy has a point.  Although there may be multiple variations of Atheists, it is a fact that many of them, if not all of Atheists, tend to decide number 7. That is, they ""know"" there is no god, call people ignorant, unwise, illogical, [ECT], even though they're probably like like number 5 or 6. So many Atheists tend to use the belief within number 7, bashing many religious people, especially christians, acting like they know it all when they're claiming a theists whom believe, can't possible know what they're talking about. Obviously there are extremes to every angle and side of things, and so this is a generalization.  Personally, I'm more of a 1-2. I'm a 2 for sure because although I do believe X, Y, Z is there, I cannot say for certain (1) because human error exists; I do not doubt in what I believe in, I doubt my humor error side."	2
I disputed but put myself on the 'yes' side.	Ah I see	2
" The reason this structure works is because the Swiss army does not take part in armed conflicts in other countries, no ""if""s ""and""s or ""but""s. I dont think them not entering wars is because of their militia but because the officials that run the country dont want any trouble."	What I mean is that the reason the peoples militia works isbecause the government does not take part in aemed conflicts in other countries.	2
"Infringements of rights in the name of some ill-defined ""greater good"" are still infringements of rights."	I totally agree with your statement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
This isn't what I believe, but it's just as valid as what you said: I believe that the big bang/nothing are immortal: they don't have a beginning or an end.  You still cant seem to shake off the idea that atheism proposes its own theories. This simply isn't true. Atheist is just agnosticism with attitude; in other words, atheism doesn't know anything, it just rejects religious theory. To be an atheist is not to believe in nothing, it is not know where we came from any more than any other human being on this planet, but to know enough that some of the theories proposed by human beings on this planet are absurd. Indeed, I would say that believing absurdities is much closer to believing in nothing than anything atheism offers up, because your belief is measured by faith, which is, as we all know, your willingness to deny reality.	I think you're misunderstanding me here. I think the theory of big bang is so beautiful and so interesting to learn about. I actually believe in big bang - but I do believe, that big bang was caused by God. Several atheists have said to me, that I believe in magic - unicorns or Harry Potter. But I'm just trying to make you realize, why I feel the same about your religion. I feel like you believe in magic, when you say there is no God - the same way you feel I believe in magic when I say there IS a God.	2

I don't agree with theoretical and quantum physics It defies the very nature of science to fight over theories which have never been proved.

The movie American History X does a really good job at demonstrating this point. Hate tends to lead to consume people and take over who they are. Sometimes it gets to the point where a person can only define themself by who they hate. This is true for so many groups, from racist organizations to extreme religious groups (like those we are fighting in the middle east). The negative implacatuons of extreme hatred are so prevalent that it's hard to understand how anyone could accept this way of life.	Another movie that shows how hate can propagate hate between different people and cultures is The Kingdom, expressing how attacks between cultures spark more attacks, creating a never-ending cycle of death and hate.	2
There are lots of people in the world that HATE Amercans. Without the miitary we'd belong to some other foriegn nation.	We'd still have air and sea power. We have the most advanced navy and air force in the world. Not to mention nukes. This is a huge deterrent.  As for terrorists, one of the things that inspires people to align with terrorist causes is our actions in the middle east. Withdrawing our armies from foreign lands would make the United States safer from terrorists, as the terrorist ranks would soon dry up with no reason to hate us.	2
You will once your VHS player breaks down and you can't buy a new one...	Right, but if you take good care of your stuff and keep it out of harms way it will last for YEARS like my stuff is.	2
well debate quality is quickly going down the drain. 	Was it ever above the drain?	2
I don't like the whole taking away 10 points when you make a debate but if it will stop spammers then I will agree with you. That should be one of the new features so it will stop spamming.	Says the guy who has 3563 points..........................................	2
I don't think it can be helped. This recent situation I tried to stop the feeling but to no avail I couldn't stop them. I think we must adjust to it.	Well before everyone came onto this site and it was the veteran users and I who was a noobie at the time there was no personal attack debates really but once more and more people came that is when debating turned into drama and so on.	2
should and could...but never will thanks to scumbags that run this corrupt planet	you mean going back to the bartering system? I like that idea, it would definelty cause less corruption and greed.	2
I'm trying really hard to understand what you say. That is mighty kind of you What qualities of someone are 'reasonably essential' That's really THE question of this debate reworded. If I get an artificial hip, is it correct to consider it part of me? I think so...Do you? what are the 'ordinary' boundaries of them that you're talking about?  For example, conception is ordinarily considered the beginning of a person, however I think it's reasonable to believe that a persons development began before that. It is ordinarily considered that when a number of organs stop functioning, that a person ceases to be, but I think it's reasonable to believe that the person has only changed significantly, and changing significantly from one stage of development to the next is what people do. Why would you define yourself as 'a complex of interactions'? Because that's what I think I am (Note: you don't mean 'literally' extending. To someone to literally extend themselves it would mean like Mister Fantastic). So you think it's IMPOSSIBLE for people to develop beyond the confines of their current biology?	For example, conception is ordinarily considered the beginning of a person, however I think it's reasonable to believe that a persons development began before that. It is ordinarily considered that when a number of organs stop functioning, that a person ceases to be, but I think it's reasonable to believe that the person has only changed significantly, and changing significantly from one stage of development to the next is what people do. Wow..you gave me an idea for a theory I've been thinking about. Thank you. I have something else to think about now. :D	2
I have life experience with this problem, because I have a little brother, 4 years old, that really likes TV. It is very hard to tear him away from the TV screen.	That doesnt mean that your little brother may grow up not being smart. He will grow up just fine.	2
It is horrible the way some people treat these poor animals - I really don't know what makes us any different from animals when I see a video like this. Have you watched earthlings? Terrible!!! I never wear fur, leather - I don't eat meat or dairy and I NEVER use beautyproducts, soaps and stuff like that that have been tested on animals. I don't wanna be a part of anything in that video, it is inhuman and it makes me wanna puke.	On this matter, I 100% agree with you. Up vote. 	2
"Animals were not created the same way. God formed man from the dust and breathed life. Animals were made from the water and land, but not formed, the different animals came from ""after their kind"" aka macro-evolution. I believe you are referring to Genesis 2 with the rain? All that says is God prepared the dust before he made the rest of creation."	"Animals were made from dust. If dust means Earth material he made them the same way. ""And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof."" Genesis 2:19 Pretty much Earth material. Animals were made from the water and land, but not formed, the different animals came from ""after their kind"" aka macro-evolution. Lol. No water. God clearly formed them. Isn't it ironic that the word formed is actually there in the verse? I don't think you completely understand the syntax of your bible."	2
I really don't trust any politician...	Me neither ...	2
I think that your suggestion to make the comment anonymous is good, except if then it gets really nasty with rude anonymous comments. Also, do you think that some people take down votes as a message to improve their debate technique? I would like to think so, but I think that some people just don't care.	The problem with your logic is when someone votes you down and does not leave a reason, they will never know what they've done wrong. You would have them guess at the message being sent by down voting and that's is simply unfair to the writer.	2
Non-christians. No one really fucks with christians because they outnumber everyone else in America .	Finally somebody else understands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
When has mascara or lipstick ever been the reason for bad grades? You cover up your face with make-up, not your brain.	I'm not talking about this kind of makeup . Everyone use mascara and lipstick . But what should we do with the students that use more than this things .?	2
There were different kinds of wars in south Afrika, such as Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya None of those countries are in south Africa... just sayin'.	sorry..made a mistake...on these countries: Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt :)	2
Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) False. Genesis clearly states God separated day from night, then created the sun and moon.	Genesis 1:14-19 KJV And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. God used the lights he had already created to signify light and day. In Hebrew creation is the creation act. Made is a purpose declaration act.	2
Jamie Fox's character as the noble DA is heroic and honorable, but Gerald Butler's character is savage and revenge, which makes Butler's character much more intriguing. Disappointed writing killed Butler's character.	That is what most people seem to have thought. Gerard Butler was the hero - he was the one that was going to show America how corrupt the justice system really is - instead, he got killed by the so-called 'justice system.' Did he not make it clear that he was not out for revenge? He wanted to keep such savagery (i.e. The freedom of his family's killer) from happening to anybody else.	2

But one didn't make them surrender, at least after three days. Did they just need more time?	they were likely in shock after seeing what the bomb did so it's not surprising they didn't surrender right away.	2
"I wouldn't think God would have a gender. At least not one that is recognizible by human standards. However, in the Bible they refer to God as ""Him"" (for some reason), so I'll go with male."	Maybe I should rephrase the title.... When I say God I don't want you to think of the Christian God, I'm going to change it to creator... Because that's more broad... Wait.	2
I agree, but it shouldn't be based on the amount of points people have (for example, Dana/Sitara has the third most on the site, and she doesn't deserve any sort of modship), but people like Joe, Hellno, Prayerfails (those who are quite respected) should get such a position, that is if Andy decides to implement the idea, as he is ultimately the deciding factor on such an important position.	Maybe we could have like... an election? Where the people choose who gets to moderate? But there should be some sort of rule that they have to have a certain number of points, to prove they're dedicated to the site. I think Andy would always get the final say though.  What would the moderators do exactly?	2
Well a bunch of people have read the books. Those who haven't it is probably going to make them mad but they will probably want to find out how she died. No need to get P.O	Some people would prefer to learn that she died by watching the movie though. Anyway, I don't like that Prim died. Katniss went through so much to save her, and then she dies anyway. BTW, Emma Stone dies in the next Spider Man movie.	2
"According to the lib that wrote the article, ""By any metric, Gov. Walker’s tenure in the statehouse has been a disastrous and divisive few years for Wisconsin, near the bottom in job creation and with a host of other problems the Charlie Brown-ish Walker has done little to solve and much to exacerbate."" ;)"	That's laughable.	2
Hey, wait? I just realized you are the fake Andy.------------------	I knew that the first time I saw the name lol.	2
Ps3 is better because it has free online Free online...that gets hacked...and then people lose all their money. Yeah, I'm happy paying $50 a year to play Xbox Live knowing my credit card information is safe. also has games that Xbox doesn't have like Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance 1,2, and 3, Uncharted 1.2,and 3, God of War 1,2,3. God of War Chains of Olympus, God of War Ghost of Sparta, Heavenly Sword, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Killzone 1,2,3 God of War 1 and 2 were made for the PS2, not PS3. God of War Chains of Olympus and God of War Ghost of Sparta were made for the PSP, not PS3. Killzone 1 was made for the PS2, not PS3.  We also have a built in Bluray player and also our games are built in with bluray. Also some games that the Xbox has like L.A Noire has 4 discs because it doesn't have Bluray. Also Bluray is a Sony product and if Xbox wants to have it then they have to pay sony since its there product.  Better technology doesn't mean a better game console. You also failed to mention the fact that PS3 has obsolete graphics, the R.R.P (Recommended Retail Price) is so high it's insane, and that the PS3 has a much slower loading time for its games. Please don't say the Xbox 360 is crap because it breaks all the time (red ring of death) because that problem has been fixed for the past 2 years ever since the new Xbox 360 consoles were brought into the market.	The Xbox only Red Rings when it doesn't know what to do. This was because Microsoft programmed it to otherwise it may have completely broken. The new Xbox 360 physically CANNOT Red Ring despite users best efforts.	2
Hmm you have a good point there. By the way are you new to this site?	Yeah... noob here. I just happen to be here recently. And I forgot what took me here.	2
Your science did not create Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional herbal medicine and yoga. Millions practices it while others consider it silly. Like I said, it is only valid when you experience it. Why do monks spent so much time meditating? It is their key to longevity relying little none on vitamins and modern medicine. I dont suppose you can explain 'chi', inner energy do you? I may make this sound funny but it is to show you the limitations of scientific explanation.	"Monks meditate to center the mind so that its not storming around, in complete stress due to reality's circumstances, (work environment, financial issues). The whole point of them meditating is to calm themselves down and see things from another perspective that isn't stuck in the moment, that would let them live healthy and stress free, which in turn promotes longevity of life. Its not some mystical power they spew out that gives them an advantage. In addition, not all forms of ""meditation"" are exactly ""healthy"" nor truly help the ""longevity"" unless its applied under scientific theory, otherwise its just ""assumption""; trial and error.  As for traditional herbal medicine, this came from first hand experience, that humans said over time ""this and that, remedies this"" they did not ""mystically"" figure this out. They had to learn it by a common hypothesis and conclusion, that if so and so herbs are applied to this symptom, it will cure it."	2
It's possible to believe in a god or gods without believing any of them are infallible or worthy of worship. Thats what I believe, so what should I call myself since (According to currently popular definitions) I should stop identifying as atheist because I believe gods exist as personality complexes much like what is described in diagnoses of MPD It's also possible to be an atheist who believes a person or people are worthy of worship, if not infallible. So, as I see it, you think it's possible to truly be atheist, while having gods, that you don't refer to as gods, What should you call yourself? I don't know...how 'bout Steve? And by Steve I mean a person who makes up their own definition for words because I've decided that's what the definition of Steve is. Now let's have a long drawn out debate about dictionary definitions and your right to ignore and reinvent them as you're wont to do. Also, people have been known to worship human beings, so one need not be a theist to do so...unless of course you want to redefine the meaning of the word theist (which you do of course). 0 sec ago	You should be aware that even in your attempts to faithfully adhere to your favorite dictionary definitions, the interpretive task is still up to you. If you don't see any value in discussing word meanings and definitions and whether they are logically tenable fine. How about this... I'd like to get your opinion on whether or not I should be classified as atheist (according to the interpretation YOU favor of what it means to be atheist) We shouldn't need to have a long drawn out debate about that, as it should be easy to establish with a short Q and A session. You ask the questions, I answer them, and from my responses you should be able to quickly and definitively explain why I do or do not fit the atheist label. Are you game?	2
I'll support that except the animal porn. This is a family site ;)	And whatever in the world, my dear Joe Cavalry, is wrong with animal porn?	2
I see what you are saying, not sure how accurate those statistics are seeing as how Alex loves to blow shit way out of proposition, as for my credibility, well the same can be said about anyone even you, but you are right I need to give some leeway in this case, I will try to find out how accurate those stats are, that's just my nature.	Thank you for your understanding. I know I'm not 100% credible and I know all prophets are false. I don't think there is even 1 prophet who has been proven to be 100% correct. I agree, there are times he blows things out of proportion. Anyway, I have given a book of the statistics compiled by the University of Hawaii in the debate information. If you need more you'll have to do extensive research into every government and probably total up hundreds to thousands of separate incidences and figures. So if what I provided for you isn't enough then I implore you to do your own research.	2
As far as using political power to pander favors, I don't think one is better than the other.	Sadly, probably true. It would be really nice to have one that was clearly not.	2
"He didn't need to kill to eat. You don't need to eat meat. And have you forgotten the debt of honour humans hold to horses? They fought in our wars for us, were our trusted companions, helped us farm, helped us build our cities, and helped us hunt. And he clearly said, ""To all animal activists, fuck you."" Which means he was making a point by killing that horse. And it is similar to slavery. Slaves were sometimes regarded as non-sentient and unequal."	"I don't need to live however I choose to be alive, so what does that matter?  People make choices, that's obvious. Aren't we passed that?  I understand humans ""owe"" horses, due to exactly what you've presented as evidence for in terms of war and what not. I actually believe horses are one of the ""prettiest"" ""most beautiful"" animals I've ever seen.  When he says ""To all animal activists, fuck you."" That makes is personal from him to animal activists. It also makes it look bad for those whom eat meat because perhaps it makes it seem like all meat eaters feel that way. Well, I'm a meat eater, I do not feel the same way. I do not say ""fuck you"" to activists for I believe it's rude and disrespectful to non meat eaters.  However, what he did was probably more ""humane"" than how many companies destroy cattle slaughtering them making them suffer.  I agree that animals should not have to suffer, however, humans are omnivores and do eat meat and eat vegetables and non meat consumption.  As far as slaves go, you basically and essentially compared black slaves to horses. Why is that? You've already mentioned how you hold humans and horses to be the same, however, why pin point black slaves? What's the point in that? I'm not stating you're racist, at all. It's just a bad comparison in my opinion.. To use the selfishness and retarded-ness of humans having humans slaves (in the wrong), compared to an human killing another human (in the right) so that they can eat meet."	2
Thank you. I still love God, but I do not like everything He does. The existence of evil, obey Me or die, stuff like that. The thing that keeps me from being an unbeliever is the loving goodness I see in my dog's eyes, the love from my loved ones, stuff like that. That may sound weird, but that is just me. :)	Okay, Ismalia I really care about your situation you're in because I found myself in the same position not too long ago when I was a struggling theist. I know it sounds wierd that some random dude on the Internet cares about you but I do, deal with it. So I'm gonna give you the link to a video that really inspired me and kind of cleared my head a bit. It's really inspiring and incredible, I think you'll like it :) now I'm not going to lie to you it is made by an atheist and I'm not pushing anything on you nor will the video, it just sums up the world from a different perspective. Please watch it, it's 10 minutes long but it's very engaging.  Enjoy and tell me what you think :) <a href='http://littleprincessvegan.tumblr.com/post/40344733054/'>http://littleprincessvegan.tumblr.com/post/40344733054/ 	2

Your message said this: Dear Brother, It is a matter of concern that, we (all) indulge in baseless debates, i.e. we do not keep the decency of debate.

So, if you were in command and could design a new political structure, how would you do it? Please do not say abolish everything and become anarchy.	Sorry, I simply wouldn't design any political structure because it involves central planning and coercion though miniscule amounts of force is required in a civilized society. All political structures lead to corruption and elitism.	2
Shit! When I was kid, we rode in the front seat. Most of the cars didn't even have seatbelts in them. Mom was pretty quick to hold her arm out if she had to stop real fast.	If you crashed into something, your mom would never have a chance to hold you in your seat. You become really heavy when you are moving, the faster you move, the more you weigh. So if you fly out through a window of a car when it crashes, you probably will weigh over 200 pounds - even if you are a little kid. So your mother would never have been able to hold you back, at the weight of over 200 pounds.	2
Personally, I've never learned a thing from homework. It's just been a huge waste of time =/	I agree you go to school to learn for around 7-9 hours a day why should you have to come home after a hectic day and do more work. Children these days have better things to do.	2

Outside of the divine creation of man, does or does not the Bible line up with the big bang and evolution?	"Outside of the divine creation of man, does or does not the Bible line up with the big bang and evolution? It does not. The book of Genesis doesn't line up with the Big Bang Theory or the Theory of Evolution. Earth did not exist before the sun, and the vast majority, if not all organic life on Earth has a common ancestor, they were not created according to their ""kinds""."	2

You got everyone pretty spot on XD Though I'm sure someone will disagree. e_e	2
The bible says God made them. Biogenesis says they typically originated from a single celled common organism. That's it. The bible says God made them. Science says otherwise. Humans, by evolutionary studies, shows us the relation we have with all species which implies a common ancestor. We are even related to bacteria.	I realize this but that doesn't mean its necessarily true in regards to humans. I mean just because we make an observation doesn't mean it intuitive. I could say the world is flat becsuse that's what it looks like to me. Guess what?! Because of that observation we believedit for thousands of years. Now we know its not, get my point?	2
George Bush was not a dictator, the mere belief of that shows a lack of understanding.	Agreed. Now for the arguement: People like Joe Stalin who is used as the picture here is probably some one who should have gotten whacked. People like Saddam Hussien who commit acts of Genocide have no right to live in my opinion. Adolf Hitler should have been assinated. Would it not have been better for a British Spy to shoot Hitler and in the ensuring confusion make sure a leader who was a little less crazy become the leader of germany instead of WW2 killing millions of people. However If not for WW2 the Great Depression probably would have lasted longer and many technological discoveries would not have been made then. But we would have those 100s of millions of people who could invent new things and develope technology also. How many of those people would be an Albert Einstien or a Stephen Hawkings. So yes killing a dictator who is worth it. P.S. This is my first post so forgive me if i did something wrong.	2
Weeeellll...those are pretty valid points actually. But considering that several of these are practiced secularly (hell, even Christmas can be), I always found the term Happy Holidays to be essentially secular in meaning. I kind of thought that was the point of it. But I can see the connotation you are highlighting. Jace appears to feel the same way. Its weird, you are the first two I have ever encountered to look at it that way (that I know of, of course). I wonder how common it is. I kind of want to poll people on this now...	Hmm... well, my whole argument with Jace is that Christmas doesn't have to be celebrated by Christians. I'm not religious and Christmas is definitely my favorite holiday lol. I'd say that most people unknowingly celebrate religious holidays, because they are legal and widely recognized... and just, why the hell not celebrate them!?  Thanksgiving has religious roots, but to most people it's about family and food. St. Patrick's Day is religious, but to most people it's about wearing green and drinking. Roman polytheism has died out, so New Years is basically now just a celebration of life... and Christmas to most people is about showing your family and friends that you care about them. The fact that so many religious holidays are celebrated by so many people, both religious and non-religious, is why the term holiday doesn't particularly apply to just religious traditions anymore. The fact of the matter is that if someone is going to not celebrate a holiday because it has religious origins, then they're going to miss out on each years most important events. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Christmas and in my opinion, it is one of the greatest examples of the good in humanity.	2
16, perhaps. Maybe 15. This was before your time, but we used to have some 10-year-olds.	I suppose I have not witnessed it but I have seen a lot of juvenile debates creep up.	2
"Definetely.  People were angry at the fact that a mosque was being built near ground zero. This anger must symbolize the comparision that people are making between a mosque, muslims, and terrorists.  Yeah, there could be a totally different reason such as someone doesn't want ""anything"" being built near ground zero but im pretty sure the comparison above is one of them.  A future friend of mine in ninth grade told me to ""go home"" so he compared me to those terrorists on 9/11.  Have you watched the movie ""My name is Khan."" I think you will love it. It would be hard to watch it a second time because it is so heartfelt. The movie is about America's view on muslims. Im a little skeptical on how the movie portrayed this anger towards muslims because i think it was a little over exaggerated. However, i did see on television one time this white male person say that all muslims deserve to go to jail.  :) Not smiling because of the last sentence. lol"	i know right! its a shame that the muslim's reputation is tainted this way! u know...that movie made me curious... i will watch it! :D	2
I don't think the green lantern movie was as bad as people say it was. It wasn't the best super-hero movie, but it was an enjoyable movie none-the-less.

As you said I'm talking about the constitution well equal protection under the law comes from the constitution.	Yes but does it really? Did our founding fathers who I remind you owned slaves truly mean for EVERYONE to be protected equally under the law?	2

The sketchiest place I've ever been was Alexandria, Egypt. We were in a taxi on the way back to the cruise ship and I thought for sure the taxi driver was going to murder us. I will never go back to Egypt as long as I live.	The sketchiest place I've ever been was in a cell with a convicted murderer. It was for work... I wasn't a prisoner lol.	2
Well, I won't dis agree that Hitler stopped Hitler, but the wall of Katusha rockets put up by the Red Army had something to do with it. The Liberation of Europe by the USSR did make the lives of people in those areas marginally better, but after Stalin's death things really improved.	I don't think you can eve say marginally to be honest. Look at the way the USSR treated the Ukraine and the other regions they occupied, its very hard to make and argument that this was in anyway better than Hitler's Germany.	2

Jails are filled with a disproportionate amount of black people. Part of that is because black people commit more crimes, yes, but I do believe there is an element of prejudice. Unfortunately there is a good reason for it, the court system sees a lot of repeat offenders. This is not a justification, just an explanation. If we find a way for black people to work hard and get out of poverty I believe there will be less in jail. I think poverty is the big problem.	Agreed. The govenment benefits from this ethnocentrism .	2
I agree that children should watch less TV because it can damage their health and also their brain, It create a new generation children which only thinking about the animation.Also watching to much TV makes the children no able to do their homework and it will affect their school marks. Otherwise TV can damage the human eyes and sometimes when the children growns up it may be need surgery to fix the lens(human eye).	It depends on what kind of programmes you refer to. If it is news, children should be encouraged to watch more as news provide information about the world around them. But let's say, they are watching too much cartoons, there should be a limit and yes, they should watch less of such stuff.	2
I so called this	Yes you did! One up vote. What are you psychotic? How did you know? ;)	2
I think it's a great idea. Most homeless people have no way of communicating with people who care about them (such as family), which leads to detachment from society and perpetuates the homeless cycle.	"This is something most people would never think about offering to the homeless. Borme's point about ""most homeless people have no way of communicating with people who care about them"" is so true. In my contact with the homeless, most believe family has given up on them or they have no idea how reach them. This would be a tremendous outreach as long as everyone---homeless and otherwise---are educated about this meaningful service."	2
Yeah but to be honest, in contrast, I don't think it's really Christians attacking atheists. Maybe I'm wrong and going to hell (see what I did there?) but I just think people should be able to sincerely call themselves Christians yet knowingly persecute everyone that isn't.  I know it's obviously not the same situation, but those are just my thoughts.	I am talking about the motivation. The motivation for the non Christians you talk about is still Christianity. Whereas the motivation for attacking the Christians in China is to make sure the communist government thrives.	2
no i never seen him and seen his face what does he look like and i live in WA	Like a black zombie pirate.	2
I didn't get upset. I just realized that no matter what I said, the situation would only lead to more bickering cause you were obviously just trying to annoy me which I find immature. Busting in all mad and sht isn't going to convince me of anything other than you are immature. So if you want to convince me I'm wrong in some way, chill out first. How am I the one who is upset or immature? I used your words.  And not I'm only asking for proof I included the option of providing an example So that i could better understand their belief or what they are trying to tell me. Yeah, I figured that out about you too late, sorry.	How am I the one who is upset or immature? I used your words. In an attempt to annoy me. Which is what it looked like to me	2
As it stands, asking whether this person is a small child is hardly equivalent to actively protesting the rights in real life of tens or hundreds of thousands of people. A child's opinion has no say, or power, in the outcome of the rights of real life hundreds of thousands of people. You approach is better suited for the politicians that do have a say in, and power over, the rights of said people. I guess my question to you would be, if you were in front of a crowd of people (young and old), would you feel comfortable addressing a child that way?	To my knowledge this person is not a child. Saying a child has a childish notion would not be insulting. I assume they are a dumb adult.  And please explain where all of this sensitivity has come from all of the sudden? My original comment was about a 6 on the insulting scale... I mean I realize only the right is allowed to throw out insults with impunity, you are a sensitive bunch over there and cannot handle it so well, but this really wasn't that bad. Cheer up. You approach is better suited for the politicians that do have a say in, and power over, the rights of said people. It is the general public which allows politicians to not act against discrimination Joe. This is a democracy.	2
It takes the inner workings of a stupid brain to know how a stupid brain really functions, so maybe youre filled with book knowledge to cover up the fact that your brain is really stupid?	How is my brain stupid? Mind explaining that? Actually don't. I don't want to hear crap.	2
I too am baffled at how you've remained a theist. I personally think that religion is so ingrained in you that your mind is finding it impossible to let it go. Reguardless it's always good to be skeptical in any context. The answer to your question is simple, which ever god had ample evidence to support its existence beyond a reasonable doubt I would be compelled to believe in it. Personal bias wouldn't play a role. I don't care if it happened to be Yaweh or Baal or the Wiccan godess or some rain god from the Incan people. Evidence is all I need.	I agree with your sentiment. my point is that one can be a theist and think for themselves. I have a crass sense of humor, I am prochoice, I have an will vote in favor of gay rights, and so on. I will not have people tell me what to do. I always have been a rebel. LOL.	2
You may think planets were created by God. Evidence shows that planets can be created through natural processes. You may think that God performs miracles, but natural processes would result in the same thing. Science continual finds explanations for how the world works without need for a God. Your only claim is that you don't want to find a better explanation, so you go with God.	You may think planets were created by God.

And we could make a cartoon show of it. We could call it Pokesaurs or Dinomons!	You ruined it. :) 	2
Following our instincts without emotional thought or logic is probably what got is into horrible situations, and besides, dont tell me you never regretted not listening to your gut instinct, everyone regrets that.	If I didn't make the sarcasm in that comment clear enough, I apologize. But. Well. Sarcasm explained.	2
If he explains it to you then Jc will know how to do it. I don't think that's what we want. Without explaining what Prod did... there's ways to gain mass points very quickly... don't you remember him doing it?	Lol true maybe one of you can massage me, because Im getting real sick of the trolls on this site, I wish I could send them a virus lol.	2
He confessed.	It appears you have stupid friends, I would look into that.  Yet, nothing was done but documented.	2
It doesn't. It evolves and adapts, eventually leading to the rise of humanity. Its not divine intervention.	So intelligence jumped from ape to human in 300,000 years?	2

Individuals typically act in their own self interests. Any societal benefit just comes from them trying to look good because that benefits them later on.  When enough individuals are making decisions together, their individual self interests average out and make decisions that are better for society. The problems the US is having aren't because society has voted for war or certain economic plans, it's that small groups of greedy people are making the decision.	Not always true though. For example, look at the stock market. There is a greed-is-good mentality (i.e. people act in their own self interests) but it doesn't always turn out to be a good thing. There are bubbles, there are crashes, there are scandals, there are worthless sub-prime loans rolled up in CDOs!	2
mint is really a flavor derived from some herb. so yeah, it was a plant really. still is.	Flavor from herb? Herb plant? American smart!! I no know this exist like that in America. En France we eat candy that taste like plant!! America do that too?	2
Well that's partly good news... but I don't think you got me on the Obamacare argument other than that one statement regarding the 50+ employees. Obamacare is still more trouble than it's worth.  The debt may be decreasing, but not very fast... and if we enter a war with Syria, then there is a possibility that the debt will begin to increase again.	I also Pwned you when I brought up the fact that Obamacare cuts $127 billion from the deficit which I had gotten the article from the completely bipartisan CBO company. I don't know where you got the $2 trillion number but It was probably from a conservative leaning source.	2
No there are different.There was a 15 pound baby in texas once .	Everything's bigger in Texas.	2
Ok, label him as you will, but either way I don't like him much!	I understand why. .	2
Well, i have to admit that I have not really read a paper newspaper except for the free local (county level ) paper that ends up in my driveway. I love the WSJ, but I am boycotting the paper version because they have a policy that they charge you more for the online edition by itself than the paper and online edition together...doesn't that suck...they make you pay more to prevent killing trees! I think they are just trying to keep the paper Beamon alive as long as they can.	I have noticed that, I guess they have to do whatever they can to stay alive .	2
Even that is bullshit.	Maybe..., but you do not have any supporting evidence so... ;)	2
And after the war, which never should have happened, Iraq should have been split up, with the Sunni portion going to Syria, the Shiite portion going to Iran, and the Kurdish portion either given to Turkey, or setup as an independent nation.	I don't disagree with that except that Turkey would be pissed if there was an independent Kurdistan and the Kurds would be pissed if they were handed over to Turkey... then what to do with Baghdad and how to split up the oil reserves... the whole Middle East is more big fucking mess.	2
Having skill is better than being lucky. Being dependent on luck will be your downfall.	You are right because no one can be lucky all the time. If you were lucky 2 times, you'll start expecting being lucky, and simply, you'll not be.	2

Palin has two major qualities that make her a good VP pick. She is the true outsider, and she will speak her mind. She has never served posts inside Washington, which will make it easier for her to point out flaws in the way the system operates, cutting unnecessary positions or red tape. Secondly, she definitely speaks her mind. This is clear from her reactions when picked as a VP and asked in an interview what the vice president even does, and her comments about the freddie mac/fannie may fiasco. Both of those give her the outside the beltway attitude that will balance McCain's experience. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtilB1teksc'>what's a vp do comments	"Before assessing her qualities as a Veep, IMO we need to recognize that there are three reasons to choose someone as your VP. One is to help you get elected,two is to help you govern after elected and third is to replace you if necessary. I think we can all agree that so far she has been a slam dunk on the first task. Her selection has stolen the wind from Obama's sails. She has totally reversed the whole momentum of this election. She has put the Obama camp on the defensive and has totally gotten into Obama's head and thrown him off his game. We have little idea what her role would be in governing the country. Her experience is similar to Obama's in depth, not as deep as Biden's or McCain's. I like what I see of her temperament, much more than Biden or Obama's. She has her areas of expertise apparently and energy is an important one. I think 3 of the 4 are independent minded and tough. The one I question is Obama. I dont think he is independent of his base. I think his base will do to him what their respective bases did to Clinton and Newt. He wont be able to swing to the middle to accomplish legislation. His base, sweeping in on a huge antio war/anti Bush groundswell will pin him to the left and demand raw meat instead of forging alliances and working to solve the country's problems. McCain coming in along with a Democratic congress will be forced to swing centrist, what Clinton and Morris called ""triangulation"" to accomplish anything. Congressional Republicans will be in no position to pin McCain anywhere.  We never know what someone will be like as President. That goes for the top or bottom of the ticket. As voters we can only do what we think is right and cross our fingers. Kennedy came in unprepared and we survived his bungling of the Bay of Pigs. Clinton came in and we faced Branch Davidians, FIring of William Sessions, Travelgate, Nanny gate times three Somalia, Haiti. But they both figured it out pretty quickly."	2
DVD's... VHS is history already !	Lol you are right, but I still have VHR's and will never get rid of them.	2
"That's what I was thinking, she might be after a little more than a ""movie buddy"", if you know what I mean, nudge, nudge, wink, wink and it ain't always what the heart wants."	We don't really hangout that much but we have talked a lot. She used to like me when I was a freshmen but not anymore since I told her I am not allowed to date.	2
I LOVE Christmas, toys for everyone: ) , well almost but you get what im saying lol, I just hate hearing how there is a War on Christmas when there clearly isnt, also whats wrong with saying happy holidays, I figure this covers all the holidays in one shot. Fox News is just butt hurt because Jesus isnt the only player in town around December 25th lol, besids the date is wrong anyways, December 25th is a pagan holiday that Christians once again stole as there own like just about everything else in that book of lies.	Many Historians belive that Jesus was actually born in the summer.	2
Bull. I am not a conservative and I never will be. I am still traumatized by what some conservatives did to me.	Do tell ;)	2
I think creation is an answer we are unable to answer with complete certainty at this point, and it would be foolish to give any more than suggestions. From a scientific perspective, we don't know, so no one gives an answer. From a theists perspective, we don't know, so we think of something that fills the gaps. To me, there is a flaw in this logic. Further, what created the creator? This explanation creates the very problem it tries to answer. To get around this, people have said 'God needs no creator', but I feel you can say just as much about the universe, with just as much proof. To me, every answer is nothing but speculation, therefore I will reject any absolute explanations.	But we can give probability to a claim. Just because two claims may be true, doesn't make them equiprobable. For example, I could claim that a piece of toast created the universe. Does that make it as likely as the Big Bang?	2
I dislike all religions. I see no reason why disliking Christianity is fine, but disliking Judaism is forbidden. All religions. There are worse things than Judaism though :L And it's the religion not the people. I have a best friend who is Protestant, and her friend is Jewish and we get on fine. As long as we don't bring up religion.. And doesn't matter whether I am antisemitic or not, that's no excuse to say Jewish people are not people.  I'm not sure if you're trying to make me out as some Nazi demon or something, as antisemitism is normally associated with those types, but I'm no more against Judaism than any other religion. Maybe Scientology is worse..	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ He's just kidding, he obviously doesn't really believe that.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	2
no because the personal should be done privately, in my opinion. also anyone who refuses to see someone elses point of view even if they think it's wrong is well, ridiculous. and remember that respect is earned not given cause it's demanded. it doesn't work that way	Do you mean to be on the opposite side. The left is yes, the right is no.	2
Who's Garry?i dont understand what you mean?Can you explain please?	Oh, Garry's lurking around here somewhere... If you stick around for a while, I'm sure you'll run into him. He may even be your nieghbor? *shudders!	2
I don't see those rules anywhere. LOL	Don't see these rule anywhere as well.-----------------------------	2
To a certain extent, I think so. In the age of twitter and incessant 'texting' people just don't bother to make coherent statements. A lot of people don't realize that with proper application, language is an art in itself. They're, their, there -- really isn't that hard to figure out.	Too many people find it difficult to put two words together.	2
As a non religious person I believe that when I die, I will just die, but the energy and matter that my body is made of will go back into the Earth, also since energy and matter can not be recreated or destroyed that after it all goes back into the Earth it will become another life form eventually. So basically I will be reborn as another life form, my cells and energy that is.	Effectively my own views expressed well enough that I see no reason to be redundant. Well said.	2
If someone is skilled in debate but knew little about Jiu Jitsu, would they be accurate to claim they are skilled in Jiu Jitsu?	"Not necessarily. They could be ""skilled"" in debate and use a bevy of dastardly tactics, paying no regard to the well being of an opponent, or creating a strengthening environment."	2
He ha, I know right? Which do you like better? I like both but women piss me off for some reason. Men are more logical. Hides from the feminists. ;)	Hmmm, I've thought about this often before, especially on holiday, which is where I am now. South of France, really nice place ;)	2

Yes I agree. But we are his servants so we shouldn't object. >.> Really though...it's like he doesn't care for the person's emotions at all. He only cares about peoples faith in him. God shows traits of a sociopath. Maybe a sociopath came up with the bible. They are known for being very convincing.	2
I've drank enough booze to disregard the debate. But, I will state that most all women want to be victimized.  Why? Do females want to screw or do they rather want to have their brains screwed out? (no explanation) Who is being penetrated? (no explanation) See, women want to be ravaged, they just don't want anyone to know that they like it. (No, I am not refering to a rapist, I am refering to a female who loves being ravaged by a man of her own liking, while at the same time having reservations about not being ravaged well enough.)	Well, that is true, but that really isn't what advertisements are all about. I see your point, though.	2
No, he's going to be up there for healthcare reform. It will save us billions and allow for a longer and healthier life. It's something we should have done when Nixon tried to do it. In the short term, he will get huge credit for not allowing this insane congress to push the U.S. off the fiscal edge and completely ruin our credit rating. But people like yourself who cannot accept that anything this president does is a great accomplishment will do as you are doing, say it's about color of skin.	great post I agree 100% obamas healthcare is probably the greatest bill since the declaration of independence was scripted americans die on average 10 years younger than some other poorer nations, the US is around 47th if the life expectancy list. this healthcare for the 50 poorest is moral its right and it will make america better stronger healthier and more united long term. bravo to obama for being brave enough to do the right thing even in the midst of the biggest recession in 80 years	2
"Ja correction, I made this debate before. And don't just guess what i get upset about, I was peeved off by the fact all you were doing was saying crude and insulting things about Jean-Paul Sartre.

Don't come to my debates if you know nothing of the topic and are not interested in it.  Two. Don't come to my debate if all you're going to do is troll around and make crude remarks. ^ Is what I was upset about Cartman."	Ja correction, I made this debate before. Ja, no you didn't. Wasn't your debate that we can't truly know anything? I was peeved off by the fact all you were doing was saying crude and insulting things about Jean-Paul Sartre. You were peeved that I mentioned his name without kissing his ass, then I started insulting him. One. Don't come to my debates if you know nothing of the topic and are not interested in it. People aren't even allowed to come to your debates if they do know what they are talking about because you get all crazy. Nobody cares who you are upset about. You don't even care.

Wow, no one knows i'm Muslim? Well, Muslim is unisex. Although, in a conversation with Muslim people and the majority of people are female then you call the people Muslima.

How do you know what true knowledge is and how is it identified if it is man made?  Not saying we know nothing, only we can't be certain on what we know.	Nothing is something, and being that knowledge can't be determined meaning it is deemed nothing. It is that something that is unknown that makes it an ability to be opinionated. Knowledge does is exist, undefined i know that i know nothing.	2

"Marriage in general is out of selfishness and pride. The idea that this person is for you and for you only. They must sacrifice for the sake of ""we're in love"". Love doesn't eliminate sexual desire for others. It merely says ""you can't act on those desires"". It's useless."	Wow...you took the words right out of my mouth, very well put. :)	2
I've been around horses so long and regarded them as equals, so I do not see the difference between shooting a horse and shooting a human.	"Every man (or woman) to each their own.  To say an animal is equal to you, fine. Lest a horse.  For me, I see as life as equal as others, in the aesthetic value of life and existence of equality.  However, since humans are omnivores, and since there is both meat and vegetables and non meat consumption available. And since humans have a particular mind cognition than others, makes me believe that they're there for a purpose, and including in that purpose, they're meant for humans to eat, if humans so choose so.  It's the circle of life, it's ""Lion King"" type shit...  Tell me I'm wrong, as a meat eater, in believing this. I cannot see how another human can refute what is natural and within our very DNA and species.  Semantics is one thing.  Judgement is another.  We all judge, that's fine. However, simply because this horse was shot in the head you claim it's like seeing a human shoot another human.  Perhaps get your priorities straight.  If it was a personal loved one of yours and a horse, whom would you choose to ""survive""..  And that, Elvira, will decide what kind of person you've become., or anyone for that matter."	2

In other words I am not specifically antisemitic, just anti religion. Give me any religion and I will argue to my fullest extend against it. The other debate was on Israel.

He helped in a small portion of the creation of the fetus. The rest from after he's done is up to the mother. Although it takes a mother and a father to make a child, the father can leave, the mother literally can not. if the father could make that choice to leave at any time where the mother can't change it. The mother should also have a chance to 'leave' at any time, where the father can do nothing about it. In this case her leaving may be abortion. If the father can say she must have an abortion then she now has to give up the child that she may have wanted to keep, if the father says birth it, she has to put her life on hold to deal with something she never meant to do.	Up vote for being prochoice. .	2
My point is: Head-on attempts to persuade can sometimes trigger a backfire effect, where people not only fail to change their minds when confronted with the facts—they may hold their wrong views more tenaciously than ever.  I see this happening all the time on CD ;)	Seriously? What are you doing? If you are not going to try to be funny, how am I going to keep going. The article says that people either turn away - me saying whatever, or literally saying I was looking away from my computer. Or, challenging the sources - me saying who has ever heard of the website you mentioned. Or, the person will fail to see the point - me saying that your examples don't apply and literally asking what your point is.  Come on man. At least say something funny. What do I need to do, add a ;) or do I need to call you old? You're killing me.	2
The CIA arranged a coup of Salvador Allende in Chile. On 11 September, 1973, a military coup removed Allende's government from power. Salvador Allende died in the fighting in the presidential palace in Santiago. General Augusto Pinochet replaced Allende as president. Pinochet was a dictator.	That is a problem right there. What is the CIA doing meddling in Chile's affairs?	2
it wouldn't surpass an primitive economy Even so, it wouldn't die. We are more likely to go extinct now than we were 20 000 years ago.	You are right x420xHustler,so why nobody asks the question:How did ancients survive without money and if someone thinks that the world crash and burn?	2
I never knew that donating can make you feel so good ;)	Yeah... it's like a huge load is removed.	2
Why must it only be a dictator? Next, the assassination of a left/right wing politician, then the assassination of a mayor - can murder be justified? Many people who live under dictators (Hitler, for example) rather like them. How many people liked George W. Bush, and he wasn't even a dicator - rather the president elected by the people for the people yadda yadda yadda.	The CIA arranged a coup of Salvador Allende in Chile.

"Well considering Christmas is not really a time of giving. It's meant to be a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus, who was sent to save us of our sins. That's why we celebrate it on the 25th of December, and it's called ""Christ-mas"". There are so many people who don't even know why it has come about, and just expect presents all the time, that it's outrageous. There is not even a spec of evidence to suggest that Christmas is about giving presents to people, nevermind ""owing"" them gifts."	I agree. People don't get it. The truth meaning is the Birth of Jesus Christ. That's what matter the most.	2
just because you don't know what happened doesn't mean you can jump to the ridiculous unlikely Why would the Jews follow him if his miracles didn't happen? Their were many self proclaimed Jesuses before and after, but only Jesus of Nazereth moved the Jews to the point of conversion.	"Why would the Jews follow him if his miracles didn't happen? Their were many self proclaimed Jesuses before and after, but only Jesus of Nazereth moved the Jews to the point of conversion. Except the Jews who didn't believe him... the same argument can be used for Muhammad, in both cases we have people following someone, that doesn't mean they are divine or ever did anything supernatural. All you keep saying is ""I don't know therefore he was God.""  It is much more probable that Jesus was a wizard who mislead people, even more probable is that he was raised by a mother who told him he was the son of God, and he acted on how he was raised. It's not unheard of for large groups of people to be mistaken, I've included a link about the Miracle of the Sun."	2
"Yes, but then you're kind of making the Big Bang your God.  That's like saying anyone who believes in the universe having a cause believes in a ""god."""	Yes, exactly. Only, some don't admit it :p...................	2
I don't eat unhealthy stuff as a snack because its not really good for you but instead I usually eat fruits like apples for snacks.	Wait, are snacks really unhealthy? Junk food is classified as snack. There are also other food as a snack, right?	2
Well it all depends on the job you have, like if you do a gamble by being in the automobile industry there is a slim chance you won't be let go.	I do personal training and I work part time at this gym. I teach tricking there. It could also be because it hasn't struck Baltimore yet.	2

I just got the word trolley from Wikipedia actually. Let's not try and pick holes in the hypothetical, just assume that it is a cable car, that could be stopped by a very fat man. Let's say the fat man has, I dunno, sodden clothes or something. Maybe he's a jedi, but this is more about morality than practicality.	Hold on, I genuinely thought it was a shopping trolley.	2
The test isn't so much about the practicality of it, but your morality.  So, for the sake of debate, assume that you can move him, and assume he would stop the trolley.	"I realize that. The first statement was more tongue-in-cheek than anything else. The second statement was to address the morality of the issue; at least, I think it's morality. It would be irresponsible to sacrifice the fat man without knowing for sure that it would save the teenagers, and, in this world, we can never know for sure what the outcome of our actions will be. Consider George W.'s invasion of Iraq. I'm sure he thought ""This is great! We'll finally be able to establish a model democracy in the Middle East and show everyone else what a great system it is!"", but, instead, the whole thing blew up in his face. He tried to throw the fat man in front of the trolley, and everyone died."	2
But why shouldn't that person be charged with manslaughter? I mean they killed someone. I can understand if it was an accident like as in me and you are having a fist fight and I punch you in your head and you fall and bust your head open on the corner of a table, and die. To that I would not charge with death. But for someone to murder someone they love no matter how mad they are is just wrong on all counts and if you can kill someone you love you could kill anyone. I say a crime of passion should be considered as manslaughter.	People react really irrational when they commit crimes of passion. They end up hurting those that they love because they themselves are hurt. It is still murder, but it shouldn't be treated like deliberate murder. But it is more severe than an accidental murder.	2
Piaf God is so real, why did he allow the Holocuast. ... Well, I assume He really probably didn't want it. It would be Hitler and Satan who would want the Holocaust. Not God.	How did God allow Satan?? You just can't face the fact he's not real. If God is so real, why are there so may Gods from so may Religions.	2
It's a tough call, but I'm gonna say no. In all things there must be lines which you just don't cross. If we ever lose all sense of honor, humanity doesn't have a very bright future.	I agree totally Jess. Without honor, humanity is nothing and nothing counts.	2
I can be firm in my belief, doesn't mean it will happen. Certainly doesn't mean I want it to happen. Bizarre thing for you to lose points on by down-voting.	I apologize. I was thinking that you were sure about it one hundred percent. I was wrong and i am sorry.  Upvote.	2
13 is way too young. Nobody knows what they are doing at 13. The problem with having such a low age is that you open up the possibility that young girls (I know this is a bit sexist, but honestly, it's how the world works) of being emotionally pressured into sex with older men.	i think you said exactly what i was thinking but there still isnt any way to stop two kids that want to have sex.	2
This is Invalid considering there isn't even a one child policy in America I provide proof, and you reject it. People in America claim they don't want kids. Those same people don't use protection. It all fits. Nope Your assumption is far off. The suicides are caused because the woman/man broke the law and decided to have a child. You know you have no proof of that, plus it goes against your statement that it was because they don't want to harm children. No I never directly stated that women WOULD NOT have children because of this policy, but that it could convince them not to have children.  You said it works very well. Can you prove I never have any evidence? :D I saw you do this stupid proof thing before and I called you out on it. So, I went back and found where you did it before. I could have sworn it was more than once. But, I guess not. I just wanted to point out that your asking for proof reaction was stupid, and you proved me right.	I provide proof, and you reject it. People in America claim they don't want kids. Those same people don't use protection. It all fits No it does not fit you failed to include the one child policy in your equation :/ You know you have no proof of that, plus it goes against your statement that it was because they don't want to harm children. No it doesn't go against the statement it's just including it within the other possibilities :l You said it works very well. Yes I did, but that does not mean that the idea is 100% successful. You are only assuming that's what i meant. :l I saw you do this stupid proof thing before and I called you out on it. So, I went back and found where you did it before.

Hellno was right when he told me that it is best to just think for yourself, be independent, and vote for the person, not the party. Exactly. At the end of the day, they're both full of shit... now switch over to the other side. Democrats suck lol.	"Of course they suck. they started to piss me off when several of them yelled at me for speaking against progressive taxation. I have also been called a racist for saying that some Jews are racist and that anyone can be racist, not just white theists. In another situation, I was called a racist for saying the following: we are all one human race, skin color does not matter, and stop playing the race card. Boy howdy, i had some words for both people, and the second situation started when i expressed the desire to be a libertarian and when I was questioned as to how many Latino libertarians there are. My response was ""I don't know, and I don't care. i will believe what is right for me no matter what, and judging a movement by the skin color of the member is wrong."" I can't believe I was a fan of Dems for so long. Okay a year is not long, but you know what I mean. Ima go apesnitch if i here much more from either party about race. And you are so right. Repubs suck, but Dems do too."	2
I believe that God means for us to help others. How we do it is up to us. God expects us to provide for the needy. This does not include helping those who won't work and support themselves. My example is from Deuteronomy 24:19-22.  19 When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 20 When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. 21 When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. 22 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.	"To the claim that God doesn't help ""those who won't work and support themselves."" Are you saying that 47 million Americans aren't working and trying to support themselves? The knee-jerk response to any social welfare program, is that the people are lazy and not hard working. I concede that there are those who are lazy, good-for-nothing people out there. But I wouldn't say that there are 47 million of them. These are people with jobs and are struggling to pay the rent and put dinner on the table. The fact that no one admits or sees is that not everyone has the same opportunities as others. It's a matter of chance where we land. Should they be punished for happenstance? Last, the question asked not what we would want. It is what would God (or Jesus or Allah or whatever deity most people believe in) do?"	2

The only exception to this rule is probably those deep down in the depths of psychosis, but I don't think these cases are relevant. Why not? Because it's a tiny bit of information it's irrelevant?  Whatever. My only point was that it wasn't a fact....since you've admitted that it's just a generalization. Then we are done.	If it's a true generalization then it's a fact. I don't think those cases are relevant because we can't properly understand these people. We have no means of knowing whether they actually have a desire to continue living. Since we can't know much about them it's better to exclude them from this particular discussion.	2

Of course! Atheists may try and paint us as cruel, cold hearted bastards. However, they always overlook the loving side of Christianity.

Atheists may try and paint us as cruel, cold hearted bastards. However, they always overlook the loving side of Christianity.

"Nah, I mean, this is like the cigarette tax. It will only deter those who aren't super serious about it, and those people don't really need to be deterred, anyway, and will likely continue their routine. I very rarely eat ""junk food,"" but, for example, I visited McDonald's at 2am on my way home from an AC/DC concert. Even if there were a tax, I would've stopped. These ""punishment taxes"" really don't seem too effective."	Just for once I'd like to know where these taxes go to. What do they use these exorbitant taxes on cigarettes and gasoline for? I rarely eat junk food either but I would hate to see that over-taxed as well. I tire of the we're doing it for your own good mantra!	2
Absolutely, the liberal elite believe they know what is best for the common man,so much so that they will go to great lengths to go against the will of the people,even the founders because of their minority beliefs.Their actions in the courts and in legislation proves this point. Amending the constitution was put into place so the PEOPLE could change if they so seemed fit to do so. The liberal elite try and change the constitution through the courts because they believe they know better than the people and they could not do so through amending the constitution because they are in the minority. Liberal elites force their control through the courts and legislation and work around the constitution or totally against it.	Liberal Elites always use the Necessary and Proper Clause along with the Commerce Clause to justify their government expansion where government can pass any law that it sees fit as long as it is Necessary and Proper. That is BS.	2

Many people take things too seriously... especially on the internet. Lighten up, none of this really matters.	What does matter?	2
I agree with it. Because after the scientific and technical revolution life has become easier and more convenient. Today we have a lot of different devices, equipment, etc. which do many things instead of us. Therefore, it leads to lack of movement and unhealthy way of life.	Moreover, with the advancement of technology people got an oppportunity to prepare unhealty,fast food ,that seem to be very tasty but indeed cause a lot of health problems such as obesity, stomach deseases and other	2
It's human nature to look for answers, to try and understand what goes on, to try and learn more about the world around us. Humans are curious beings, with a (relatively) high capacity to learn, after all. It is rational to base our answers off of the questions we see in life (why do we not float away from earth, because all objects of mass pull any other object of mass towards it), which can then turn into scientific theories, and test them, expanding our knowledge exponentially over the years, explaining the beauty in the world, benefitting humanity in untold ways, and many other things. It is not rational to make up answers and create stories and stop others from asking questions. It is not rational to deny facts, reasoning, and logic, to maintain your age old answer. Religion is not rational. Theism is not far behind.	I never said religion was rational, religion is propaganda. (IMO) So wouldnt it be rational to wonder HOW all this stuff came to be? And if you dont believe in god you could just believe in the multiverse theory, or string theory, but god does not have to be a person, god could just be the force that keeps our blood pumping, wither way, there was some creative force to everything that has come into the universe.	2
Not the internet, that's for sure.	I agree completely. However, what is the meaning of life?	2

DISPUTE! I have a terrifying fear of cockroaches. Just cockroaches, I'm fine with other insects and I love reptiles ... but I am scared to death of cockroaches. Well Didaskaleinophobia would only be associated with someone who is at a young age, an age where a phobia is likely due to the environment that school is. There is a numerous amount of kids who end up being home schooled as the school environment is traumatizing to them.  However as an adult a phobia like Didaskaleinophobia should be outgrown therefore a phobia like a fear of going to work shouldn't be viable. As the brain has had time to develop into the mind of an adult. Whereas some might never grow out of such a phobia most should, and hypothetically will.	How's this a dispute - you pressed 'support'! I haven't the faintest idea what to dispute. I don't care much for cockroaches - though I did want to dissect a snake when I was younger (too much Quincy).	2
the question is do you believe? Not do you know? I'm confused. The question is Is Agnosticism bullshit?. I don't understand what you mean, could you clarify?	No I am not talking about the debate question, I am talking about the question that leads to Agnostics and Atheists revealing their ideology.	2
"That it's a mixture of the two, is a given. Otherwise the debate title would have asked ""which statement about humanity is true"" instead of ""Which statement about humanity is more true"" If you think wrong doing is almost always accompanied by a lack of understanding of the depth of the consequences (and it seems from your arguments that you do), then it follows that you believe statement ""A"" is more true."	"I believe them to both be equally true. ""Better"" is used in two contexts."	2
Nope I am not going to burn in hell. I will still follow Christ.	Me too, kiddo, me too. :)	2
"I think Christian socialism is theologically justified, and I can argue that if anyone wants, but asking this about ""God"" in general is a stupid question."	I agree that the question is silly and no one really knows. (By the way, there are more civil ways of expressing your dissatisfaction with a question.) The thrust of the question is to start questioning why would social conservatives or values voters oppose an issue like universal health care and favor an issue like abortion.	2

Yes the sun is responsible for global warming of course it is, without it there would be no warming (and no life for that matter) of that is true but the primary casue of accelerated global warming as supported by the entire worlds scientific community is that the accelerated warming is due primarily to the increased concentration in the earths atmosphere of green house gases (CO2 and CH4) which cause certain wavelengths of light to be diffracted back into the earth when leaving, this is man made global warming and to disagree with the scientific consensus shows just how stupid a person you are me friend.Peace out.	<a href='http://www.skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-sunspots-global-warming.htm'>http://www.skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-sunspots-global-warming.htm 	2

Our house has two hidden rooms built in it and we never noticed until my sister tripped and hit the wall and the noise from her impact sounded like a door.

The one my sister fell into hasnt been opened. We aren't really interested in opening it.	I would want to open that door as soon as I discovered it, I would get so curious with those sorts of things.	2

"Under this proposal, I have no problem with it. lol But I was originally going to post under ""it needs to stop"", because I joined this site to debate topics, not give advice and be a support group for someone having personal issues.

That's it."	2
You'd have to search for it. Dana changed her name to Sitara, which apparently means 'satan' in another language.	sitara is satan in urdu? (concluded that from the arguments i read) oh. i thought it meant a star.	2
"By ""we"" I was meaning Canadians, but it doesn't stop there. It would be great for foreign nationals too. I also hope that our neighbors would make a high-speed rail network and get their economic system sorted out, so we could both benefit. It would be nice for everyone."	Yes, yes. It'd be great for all, I was just limiting my self to your topic. The pre-note was just some insight into my answering the question, sorry. I tend to forget that everyone's not American on this site. If everyone built a rail, we could have connecting rails, and systems eliminating a need for passports, and opening up communications. I see flaws in a world wide rail system, like peace and money, but it's a great idea to look into in the future.	2
yeah. [: depending on the series (i.e. a 1992 3 series or a 2004 G7500) they might cost more than some american cars, but they're parts are still pretty easy to find.	Tre any old car it can be hard to find parts for.	2
"Yeah... Your message said this: Dear Brother, It is a matter of concern that, we (all) indulge in baseless debates, i.e. we do not keep the decency of debate.

Yes, you can click my link or you can Google it yourself. The Bermuda triangle is a real geographic place. It's a triangle formed by Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and Miami. Here is another <a href='http://www.bermuda-attractions.com/bermuda2_00004f.htm'>link.	I can agree that it is geographically real, just not the fact that all the incidences of death are linked to the triangle itself as the Bermuda Triangle is only unique of its compass difference of the northern direction. Otherwise, I agree on its geographical output.	2
I did. I now block all enemies from my debates. I see that people are following me around and down voting me. Oh mon Deu, c'est tragique!	Did abby get blocked? On your other debate she was talking about tickling me and i noticed that she got banned.	2
I take the view that it's better to be in associations, because it makes student life more interesting. For example, now I'm not in any organization, and it's boring. When you are in organization, you communicate with people, you focus not only in studying, you focus in other intereting things.	seems that you're a freshman) me too. Being a part of some organizations kind of makes your student's life way better. But don't you think that most of them are just wasting your time, all they do is parties and parties? Should KIMEP run some new clubs? For instance, are you interested in volunteering?	2
The financial crisis cannot be pinned to one person. If it had to it wouldn't be Bush. As much as I disagree with most of his moves, this financial crisis looms deeper.	If you really want to debate this all you have to do is just actually do some research. There is no way that Bush could be held responsible for the crisis. It was a stream of events that lead up to it. For starters it was just as much governments fault as it was with the banks. The seed got planted way back in 1970 when they created Fannie and Freddie which the Government created.  The biggest kicker is Bill Clinton when he signed the Glass Stegall act which allowed banking and investment to operate under one company. Also the Community Reinvestment act which encouraged lending for affordable housing and helped poor people get financing. So it was really government intervention of the financing that got us into it. If you really want to blame someone Bill Clinton is the biggest reason for the meltdown. In 1999 the house tried to overturn this and Democrats turned the bill down and here we are today. Here is one link for you. If you really go out and look for the reason you will find it. <a href='http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html'>http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/                                       was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html 	2
If you write another comment with such bad language as that you will be banned for a week!	What? I don't see any bad language from anyone on this debate? Unless she edited it? Speaking of that, if a person edits an argument, I think it should say that it has been edited, just a suggestion.	2
No worries, I suppose this debate doesn't exclude morality, so your point is valid, though if and whenever I disagree with you, don't take it personal, though I don't think you are, I think I come off hostile when I disagree with people.	No you have been civil this entire debate, which had made it enjoyable	2
If dumb is meant in the slang sense... which means... in essence... stupid! than duhr! they are stupid, ofcourse... but if dumb is meant as those who can't talk than nooooo!!! there have been really smart people that could not talk.	Lets take the scientific method. To propose this, we have to reject the alternative. Is it possible for a dumb-not mute- person to be intelligent? this would by oxymoronic. therefore, I reject this hypothesis, and establish that dumb- not mute- people are stupid. This statement is not only true, but tautological.	2
People have different opinions on it, but mine was always that a geek is somebody who acts outside the norm of society while a nerd is somebody who invest more in intellectual studies rather than stuff like sports.	I had always assumed a geek was a nerd and a nerd was a geek lol.	2

Wow, you posted something like 15 times and didn't put in any energy. You really showed me how to debate ... like an asshole.	He did that to me too. Just ban him. .	2
Really? Being close minded has nothing to do with you accepting the common views of this modern society. Its really about if you change your mind easily or how well you analyze another person's point of view. You being pro all those things doesn't make you open minded, it really just says that you easily accept whatever theory floats around in the atmosphere and then cling to it until another movement comes.	Leave me alone. I have no time for your stupid superficiality.	2
You're too mellow lately, I am having a really hard time messing with you. I will get you, don't you worry. ;)	"Hehehe, no worries now ;)  Hey, if you're really stuck, try these.

""Why homosexuals should be cured."" Or something like that, I mean any one of those and you're sure to piss me off :P"	2

Thank you :) I suppose that If there is a finite number of things, everything can be known. On the other hand if things are infinite than it's impossible to know All because all logically entails a finite class of things.	I think whether the sum of all knowledge is finite or infinite is a matter of some debate. I would probably say that it's infinite, as there is not only a truly massive amount of hypothetical knowledge available to be know (rules of logic, applied logic, mathematics, science, natural laws, academia essentially), history recreates itself in every single instance of existence (particles are moving every second, into countless orders and arrangements, along with more historical knowledge), but there is also the problem with time. While we can only observe it in a linear fashion (time as the independent variable), there are theories which suppose that this is not necessarily true. For example, before the Big Bang (which is supposed to have created time), what was there? Everything and nothing. Not only is it incomprehensible, I would imagine that it's infinite at the same time.	2
well debate quality is quickly going down the drain. 	What is debate quality? It seems a bunch of people on this site do not know what debate means and how to come about debating. (I'm not saying you do not know the what and how, I'm stating rhetorical question, kind of...	2
Yes, but the title comes with benefits. People will definitely look differently on your resume if they see 'legally united' over 'married'. It's all well and good that everyone has a water fountain, but if that separate water fountain isn't really the same, then it's not fair.	Do you know what a marriage is under the law? Oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. They are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if I had two identical roses and called them Joe and Sam, they're still both the same rose.	2
What do you mean milk is max 3.5% ? I've seen milk with 8% milk in the states. I am vegan because I find it odd that human beings are the only specie who continue to drink milk as adults, and also the only specie who drink milk from other species. Vegans live longer :)	Humans are the only species that does a lot of things.	2
We would have to survive against the dinosaurs because they would try to eat us. It would basically be a war but against the dinosaurs. Unless however you tame a dinosaur and become allies with it.	We could start taming dinosaurs, and have them fight against each other and name all their cool and unique moves. We could have those go out and collect each individual dinosaur at the age of ten, call themselves, a dinosaur trainer. Have gyms set up where gym leaders battle dinosaur trainers, and if they are beaten they give the trainer a badge. If you collect all eight badges you can go to a dinosaur tournament where all the best trainers go to battle each other's dinosaurs. We can nickname them, and have a strong philosophy revolving around young kid's love between their dinosaurs and them. ;)	2

That's absurd. Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills - The content of the knowledge/skills is irrelevant.	But your belief system can prevent you from acquiring and applying new knowledge skills.	2
I've actually met tons of people from Puerto Rico (at my old school), most of them did not know english and the ones who did knew very little, not even enough to understand simple things. It is true that people tell them English will be vital to their education, however most do not learn the language anyway.	The language is not something that can be forced upon them either. Even if many of them do know english and America is being better suited to accomodate those who do not speak much english, it will still cause need from some potentially unwelcomed change. You can neccesarily make someone learn something that they don't feel is neccessary. It could be more problematic than helpful. Then again it could be the other way around. There is really no way to know.	2

"That has nothing to do with what I said, and there is very little anyone is fully capable of saying that won't offend somebody somewhere. But hey I'm not one to refuse a lady.  ""The word nigger is not to be confused with the word niggardly."" There I conveyed information. Who would that sentence offend?"	Like the sentence you gave one must say the word beforehand and your example is a correction of the way that person would have used the word. The word itself automatically relates itself with the African American population. It may bring offense. It really just depends on who hears the word.	2

Banning something is the most effective way of ensuring its rise to popularity. This would be a foolish thing to do if one deplores religion.	"Banning something is the most effective way of ensuring its rise to popularity.  That's called the ""Forbidden Fruit Effect"" or ""Reactance Theory""."	2

"Ha Ha! What an ignorant question indeed! China lacks Air and both Naval superiority,and i don't believe Russia will be on board with China in invading the U.S. Russia and China aren't exactly ""amigos""."	You are out of your mind! See you and the public think china has no navy no airforce etc. But the us military knows. The report recently released by the chinese relation committee said that so far China has an equal number of frigates, a couple more destroyers and actually an equal number of subs. But thats just the tip of the iceberg! They have stolen all blue prints of our f-35 22's, stealth ships, the list is never ending, They are back engineering everthing we have as we speak. But hold on cause cause im just getting started. They have been selling our military microchips that we use in everthing from sattalite guided missles to our fighter jets. These chips have a back door built in each one that allows the peoples liberation army to remotely control and interrupt these weapon systems. Speaking of sattaites, as you may have guessed they've hacked into our military sattalites and even breifly took control and placing malware that could lead to future disrruptions. Our electrical infrastructure has been breached and back doors have been placed along it that could be used in time of war to disrupt the system. China and russia have conducted multiple sea based excercises! Russia has been conducting submarine patrols up and down the east coast even comingbwithin 12 miles of breachin us airspace with strategic bombers during july 4 2012. Yea russia and china not a threat. Connect the dots! An invasion is in the works and its a slow process, of course we will be totally caught off gaurd. Wondering when did they get here? Wake up China is enemy #1 and our government is not prepared for the fury that China is about to bring.	2

Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. If you are able to safely close the distance between yourself and an attacker (which is required to apply an armbar), and the situation is life or death, there are other techniques (that also are not Jiu Jitsu) that would be more advisable. In a true rage...a hyper-extended elbow can be ignored.	Correct. In a true rage they can ignore a hyper-extended elbow. Which is why you have to make sure it pops off ;)	2

"Well it's just the fact that he can leave and she can not, So abortion is her 'leaving'. She wouldn't abort an artificially inseminated child because that's taking an active initiative to have a child. other times accidents happen, and when they do any man has no physical tie to the woman or the fetus so he should have no say over abortion. If you look at it from the perspective of him saying ""Keep the baby, I want a child"" it's all well and good because he's staying to watch over the child, but it gets bad when you see that she has to 'watch' over the child for around 9 months, she has no choice in the matter. Then if you look at it from the side of him saying ""Abort the damn thing."" it's again okay because he's saying that he wants no part in it, but again it's bad because he is saying to abort because he wants to stay with her without a child. I understand pretty well the point you and others who say he should have a word are making. It's his child. If he told her to abort it it'd be messed up and people would fling to the fact that it's her child, yet how come when she gets an abortion because she wants to it's not the same thing? I say it's not because of the level of attachment that is there."	If I want to have a kid bit my wife doesn't my opinion should be just as valid that kid has as much of my DNA as it dose hers I'm not saying the man gets the deciding vote but its his kid too dammit he should have a say.	2
I know, I didn't mean it like that, I meant to ask what wasn't clear. I hope I helped clear it up though. I do believe the solution is making everyone the same. But, I don't think that it needs to be literal. People can be different, but act very close to the same.	To act the same way and look the same way are two different things. Which of these are you suggesting would be the solution for racism? I'm just asking - of course making everyone look the same would be a solution. But personally I don't think it's a proper one. I think that is like sweeping the dust under the carpet.	2
And that's fine for an elective, but it's hard to fit in all the academic classes you need as well as all the electives you want. How many periods does your school day have? Mine had 7, which allowed for 6 academic classes and 1 elective in my case.	I have 6 periods a day. And we have 3 classes that are all year round and the other 3 are electives.	2
All you people who said they are going to look after their elderly parents, come back here after changing a few diapers and let me know how that worked out for you ;)	Um hello? looking after your elderly parents can mean taking them to the doctor when they're to old to drive- It doesn't have to mean living with them	2
Oh... well then, why did you make this debate? I see people posting pictures every now and then to support their arguments. Then again, I haven't tried, so I don't know for a fact.	I don't think you can! I was trying to, all you can do is add a link or embed a video.	2
Temporary insanity, sounds reasonable! But if someone has the willpower to kill someone they love doesn't that mean that they have the willpower to kill a stranger?	Not at all Wolf. You probably couldn't walk up to a stranger and shoot him then rob the till! But if you saw someone killing your dad or mom I'll bet if you had a gun, you'd shoot it. You value life, I hope, and would not just run about injuring, maiming or killing for shits and giggles or money.	2
Though I don't want it for my car, the issue you're outlining is one of safety. The fact is, my kitchen contains between 10 and 20 weapons, and electronic devices that (without packaging), could cause fatalities. We already take potentially damaging technology for granted, nuclear power wouldn't be a stretch. Should a piece of equipment ever require kilograms of uranium, you'd have a different argument on your hands.	Well, I already Hold a Design Aesthetic in mind that only requires about 27cc of U, which is apprx. 0.5Kg. The Security issue I present is more so one of Public Acceptance, which you acknowledge. I dont think that a Uranium or Plutonium Car Battery is more harmful than the Lead-Acid Battery you have in your car now. Besides, its not like it can explode. Its encased in more lead and security measures than you can imagine.	2

OK, so if there was no money in the world then... this is my view... Say I had Food and You had Shelter, I cant live without Shelter and You cant live without Food, So we want to trade but the trade is not fair, No trade is ever fair so money was invented to people were not fighting of recources. So if there is no money then peple will become savages and fight over recources, e.g. The Hunger Games or The Stone Age. The world cant be sustained with no money, but sooner or later some bright spark would invent it. Thank You.	Nice point but the hunger games was a bad example as there was money in the hunger games :P	2

And love needs a godly source? Isn't it more beautiful to think that love just is? That it is more pure and created from your parents and dog than from god?	"Yah, love doesn't need a god. Love is more pure when it doesn't need a god. I mean, if love needs a god, then is all things an atheist loves just false love? You could say ""It comes from god"" and try to tell them they're wrong, but you can't prove it. It's just occam's razor, isn't it? Either love is from god, to your dog, or it's simply from your dog. It's more pure the second way, without a god. Not that this has anything to do with the existence of a god, but still, I don't think god = love.  I think love = love."	2
"Easier is not the same thing as easy; the former implies a relative position to an unendurable level of pain and suffering whereas the latter implies no relative position but rather that the action is a simple one and not a difficult decision to make. As someone who has experienced suicidal ideation I can assure you that even the consideration of taking one's life is not ""easy"". Sure, taking one's life is in a sense an act of escape but such an act is not innately cowardly when it is taken in its appropriate context. For instance: I fail to see how it is cowardly to be pushed beyond the natural limits of the human endurance of pain and suffering through no choice of one's own. I similarly fail to see how it is cowardly to be subject to changes in brain chemistry and structure which you do not choose to experience."	I feel I should let you know, in your passion you were arguing under the position of yes it is cowardly.	2
Want to know a 50 character limit trick?	Sure frand. Cuz this 50 character crap sucks........................	2
I think it's perfectly natural for the planet to go through hot periods and cool periods, like the ice ages. Right now we're heading into a warmer period. Of course, many people say the temperatures are rising at a much quicker rate than ever before, but how can they be sure that this isn't natural for the planet? My biggest problem is that people put too much blame on the human race for and global warming. In reality, <a href='http://www.greendiary.com/entry/cow-emissions-far-more-responsible-than-co2-from-cars-in-global-warming/'>cows emit more greenhouse gases than we do just by farting and burping. Also, the volcanic eruptions that have occurred during all of humanity's existence have emitted more greenhouse gases than humans have. True, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse emissions at an exponential rate, but volcanoes still emit more gases than humans do.	I think the Earth's normal temperatures are switching around. Like the heat Texas normally has is going to the north & south poles & melting the iceburgs. & at the same time the coldness from the north pole is coming down to Texas & freezing the place. It snowed 2 times last winter. & now when I get up for school I have to wear a jacket. It's spring! it should be warm in the mornings. & every time it is freezing cold in the mornings I get mad at Al Gore for the global warming nonsense. & the cow farts causing global warming is LITERALLY a bunch of bullshit! LOL XD But yeah the volcanos cause more green house effect than us.	2
Polar bears at the zoo are well fed. When someone jumps the fence to pet a polar bear, the polar bear doesn't try to gently help the person safely back over the fence where he belongs. No, the polar bear rips his limbs off. Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. ;)	This message brought to you by a lovable laughing dog. ;)	2
Oh yes, I certainly did. Pretty much nothing I was doing at the time was in any way beneficial, and I arrogantly pushed aside all of these really advantageous opportunities that I was being offered, simply because I didn't care. It took my a while to start to realize how badly I had messed up. So now I'm pretty much dedicated to being more or less the opposite person that I was then.	Yes, it was the same way here.	2

"Beifre it was hot and gaseous and opaque, allowing plant life to form. Light was still going through. God created lights in the heaven. The literal verse says when he let light shine on the earth.  Genesis 1:17 ""And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth"" Earth no light. The sun didnt exist. The earth couldnt even form. It wiuld just be scattered material.  OK I'm gonna ignore the part about ""after their kind"" with you because you don't under Hebrew. Literary devices. I study more than you know. You don't understand your bible. You just have to answer for this apparent contradiction. You made a false claim. Also you must realize that in a hazardous gas like environment plants will not grow. They will die. So no. Quit lying kid. God made the light for heaven."	The firmament is earth's atmosphere!  The first plants evolved in the Ordovician Period. At the beginning of the period, around 485.4 ± 1.9 million years ago, the climate was very hot due to high levels of CO2, which gave a strong greenhouse effect. The marine waters are assumed to have been around 45°C (113°F), which restricted the diversification of complex multi-cellular organisms. But over time, the climate become cooler, and around 460 million years ago, the ocean temperatures became comparable to those of present day equatorial waters. -Wikipedia So the plants evolved in the gaseous CO2 atmosphere, the sky being opaque. The waters were to hot to form multi-celluar, but the ground could form plants due to high levels of CO2. Once again, lines up with the Bible.	2

You're right, I won't invest the time, not because I don't want to but because I'm not a liberal and I have a job to get to, but I look forward to your irrational ramblings and hatred toward everything American when I get home! Have a great day buddy!	Thanks that really means alot. I look forward to presenting you with further info. on how you beliefs are twisted, and how your living in a bubble of misinformation created intentionally by your government in order to manipulate your understanding of the world. BTW i dont hate everything american, ive got nothing against american people.	2

It's a branch. You get witches who aren't Wiccans. But the definition of Wiccan is disputed all the time, it could be someone who follows the wiccan rede and practices withcraft, or someone who identifies themselves as wiccan. But there's loads of branches in Wicca. I don't believe in the threefold law so some Wiccans would say I'm not Wiccan.	Oh okay my bad. So only some do and some others okay. I was wrong.	2
Its funny cause at least God judged people on their conscious actions. Its funny how the same people who say Gods judgements are unfair, are all for the slaughter of unborn children. At least God judged conscious actions.	Its funny cause at least God judged people on their conscious actions. Actually, no he didn't. He condemned all of mankind because of the actions of Adam and Eve. It wasn't my conscious decision to inherit the sins of my forefathers and be punished for what they did. What conscious action did the slaves take that was worthy of punishment when god said it was okay to beat them? Exodus 21:20-21 What conscious action did the young girls take that was worthy of punishment when he said it was okay to sell them? Exodus 21:7-11 Its funny how the same people who say Gods judgements are unfair, are all for the slaughter of unborn children. At least God judged conscious actions. And why is it wrong to terminate the life of something that has no consciousness? What is it about killing that makes it wrong? I've asked this to people who are against abortion many times but have never received a response. Do you believe gods judgements are fair? Is beating your slaves a fair thing to do? Is selling your daughters fair to them? Is killing someone for trying to be helpful fair? 2 Samuel 6:1–7 Is subjecting people to eternal torment for finite and minor crimes fair? These are not rhetorical question. I want you to answer them truthfully.	2
"I know the feeling of that guy in the second picture. That damned noise makes me want to throw the alarm clock out the window, but it does help.

I set my alarm clock maybe fifteen minutes before I should get up when I have to get up at a certain time, and then try to ""naturally"" get out of bed for the next half hour."

What kind of question is this? Obviously both. Non Christians, who strongly support their side or just oppose the other side discriminated against Christians, and vice versa.	"That's not necessarily the definition of ""discrimination"" it is more complex than that. Discrimination is societies persecution of victims, not simple opposition. Black people opposed what white people did during the civil rights movement of the late 50s/early 60s does that mean black people were discriminating against whites? HELL NO!"	2
I've seen way too many pictures on failblog.org of people who get tattoos and misspell a simple word on it! And I think it just shows how ignorant and lazy some people can be, when they don't use the correct grammar. Of course, I understand when it's just a typo here or there.	"This gets to me, too. Sometimes, people do it so often that I wonder if I'm the one doing it wrong, but that feeling goes away pretty quickly. I actually took a quiz online before about ""there, they're, their"" and it said I got 50%! I looked up the ones I got wrong, and the quiz creators were even wrong about it."	2

Basically the point I was going to make, I would add though that those that think we are some sort of evolutionary pinnacle are greatly deluded, and lack a serious understanding of what evolution or more natural selection does.  Also, have an upvote.	Exactly, I was pointing this out to Arya in a debate about humans' treatment of animals.	2
I just picked an answer so I could comment. I just want to forget this artificial race stuff. Our religion teaches in Acts 17:26 that we are all one human race. I has a a sad. :'(	Then why did you pick the side that said it was a racially motivated attack?	2
That could be interpreted as a threat !	I am very nice if you get to know me. =D	2
It does'nt bother me if a debate concerning Atheisim and Theism is posted up and it is mainly Americans who join it then who cares at least it gives you someone to debate with if you so choose	True. Good point. There's not a whole lot of debate going on on this site (and it's a debating site!?), so any opportunity probably is a good opportunity.	2
I am a Christian and I am a centrist prochoice progay proreligiousfreedom person who knows for a fact that we are all one human race. Tell me again how close minded I am.	Really? Being close minded has nothing to do with you accepting the common views of this modern society. Its really about if you change your mind easily or how well you analyze another person's point of view. You being pro all those things doesn't make you open minded, it really just says that you easily accept whatever theory floats around in the atmosphere and then cling to it until another movement comes.	2
We need to be a LOT more tolerant of the fact that other people will disagree with us and have completely different value systems to us. It's a debating website. If you can't handle the heat, the kitchen exit door is right over there.	I totally agree, that whole you dont agree with I hate and ban you and i'm going to set up another debate slagging you off mentality is a pain and needs to go, whats the point in coming on a debate site if your not going to debate and act like your in a playground.	2
Oh I dare. Plus that's not what Christ said so what he is saying is false and I think he is a false prophet.	I agree. :)	2
Okay, but prove to me that the individual in the crowd isn't acting because of social motivations. Perhaps he or she is acting because they expect to look good by being the first to applaud. The question is, in some respects, flawed. I side with John Dewey. An individual cannot be considered irrespective of society and similarly society cannot be considered irrespective of the individual. Collective intelligences mirror the intelligence of the individuals which compose them and individuals can be persuaded and affected by the intelligence of society.	It's not that the clapper is motivated by social concerns - most likely he is, since clapping is a group behavior - it's that he has evaluated for himself, as an individual, whatever it was and reached the conclusion, independently, that it is clap-worthy, ie, he approves.  If he was alone, he would not clap to communicate his approval.	2
There are some people on here that it is impossible to convince that they are wrong because they are just too close minded and refuse to see another point of view except their own but there are some people on here who are open minded and interested in learning and seeing things from another point of view, it all depends who you are debating.	True. But if your have too open a mind, your brains fall out ;)	2
"I do agree with all of the things that the people on the NO!! side are saying. They have good points. However, the question is ""is money really that important?"". It shouldn't be that important, but unfortunately in todays world it is important."	"I don't believe that was the point of the question. The question clearly asks ""Is money really that important?"" not ""Is money important?"". In today's society yes I agree with you it is important. But, in the grand scheme of things it isn't really that important. Infact society would benefit greatly by it's demise. However, revolutions of such magnitude need (guesstimating) 80-90% or more people on board before it has a chance of being diminished. Trade system would probably be put in it's place. Where value of objects is more subjective then not. and because im clarifying I will remove my point."	2
These people should be shot. Right in they're face ;) ~~~~~~~~~~	"Don't you think that it would be to harsh too do that too there faces? :) Oh I forget to mention that in my YEARBOOK from junior year, the senior ""Remember when..."" section said ""Our chem teacher through us out into the hallway for not doing homework."" He did the same to my class and it's a long story. The point is they used the wrong form of ""threw/through"" and made the sentence make no sense! >.<"	2
I agree, although I think it's likely to happen much faster than that. We're already seeing a range of antibiotic resistant bacteria which are immune to standard treatment regimens. And with a slew of superbugs emanating from Asia and Europe each year, we probably do have something to be somewhat concerned about.	See? I am not crazy. I think the chance of it happening is very possible.	2
Yes. But I think the tax should be based on quality of food and payed in two equal parts. Half from the seller, and half from the customer. The problem is that low income families are the people who eat fast food or junk food. And it causes health problems. Those same low income families need medicare. So essentially the government pays for their indulgences. It's not right.	(your argument is soo lonely.) i agree with you completely(~) this is something that realy should be done, though i feel that this maybe should be done in conjuntion to a portion size as well. if you only have 4 fries it isn't bad for you. etc. the only problem i see is, where do you drawl the line for what is fast food and what isn't. at mcdonalds you get attrocious food fast, while at subway,pollo tropical, and miami subs, the food is of a better quality, but how do you decide the quality, is it based on nutritional value of a certain food item. what if it is ordered with no mayo or cheese? is the price reuced? and what about non fast food, for the sake of my post, slow food restaurants. if a slow food restaurant has un healthy food do they pay the same tax? or is this just a vendeta against the poor? (whoops did i just say that) and saying that fast food and madicare correlate is bs. fast food and low education/moral/all sorts of other factors play into it. if a rich person eats mcdonalds every day and they dont have medicare do they still pay the tax? now this tax is unfare! why should i pay for the government to provide medicare by paying taxes on fast food. its a viscious cicrle.	2
In JFK's case, they did something else for free as well...	Yeah... Bubba too.	2
I don't agree with theoretical and quantum physics It defies the very nature of science to fight over theories which have never been proved.	It defies the very nature of science to fight over theories which have never been proved. Quantum Mechanics is one of the rare theories that had its basis in mathematics worked out well before the experimental data came in and confirmed it. It is a very useful theory.	2
The point I am making is that belief is active if somebody does not know what they believe than they do not believe. Agnosticism theologically is inaccurate everybody has to take a side and if you don't take a side than you are an atheist meaning non theistic.	There's a flaw in all of this: Agnostics don't 'believe' in anything. Atheists, however, believe that there is no god, and theists believe there is. So yeah, I do think you can take a position of not taking a position, if that makes any sense. Agnosticism isn't really bullshit, it's just not taking a side on something that nobody has definitive answer to.	2
"I would for sure choose to be a sith, because I don't have the patience to be a Jedi.

And not have arrogant council members telling me exactly where to go and what to do."

"From your wiki link: ""The inherent intelligence of swarms has inspired many social and political philosophers, in that the collective movements of an aggregate often derive from independent decision making on the part of a single individual. A common example is how the unaided decision of a person in a crowd to start clapping will often encourage others to follow suit, culminating in widespread applause. Such knowledge, an individualist advocate might argue, should encourage individual decision making (however mundane) as an effective tool in bringing about widespread social change.: Why did that one person start clapping? If it was for a good reason, then the whole swarm is smart. If it was for a dumb reason, then the whole swarm is really, really pathetic. Your link presents a stronger argument in favor of individual judgment, methinks."	Okay, but prove to me that the individual in the crowd isn't acting because of social motivations. Perhaps he or she is acting because they expect to look good by being the first to applaud. The question is, in some respects, flawed. I side with John Dewey. An individual cannot be considered irrespective of society and similarly society cannot be considered irrespective of the individual. Collective intelligences mirror the intelligence of the individuals which compose them and individuals can be persuaded and affected by the intelligence of society.	2
Yeah... and what people fail to realize is that the Bible was written by men, not God or Jesus. Not even the apostles wrote it! The Gospel According to Mark (or whoever) is a title, not a reference to the author. For many years the gospels didn't even have titles. They were added later to increase the plausibility.	"I've said it before and I'll say it again. The way the Bible is written, the effect it can have on people, the evil that has been done in its name, it seems more likely to be the work of the Devil than any divinely inspired prophet. I don't even believe in the devil, but I'd put his authorship of the Bible as being more likely than God telling selected men to ""tell it like it is""."	2

"Yeah thank god the USSR (who exterminated everyone who got in Stalin's path of his megalomaniac world vision) stopped those fascists from ""Exterminating everyone who gets in the path of your megalomaniacal world vision"""	"I think Stalin just cared more about his power than anything. There was this one time where someone came into his office and he said: ""Why are you eyes looking so shifty today comrade?"" The person he was talking about was then sent to gulag for 10 years. At least the bad things Stalin was responsible for didn't last forever, and he did stop Hitler."	2
I'm not talking about a legal context. Think way out in the wilderness where there are no rules. I don't think the law provides any grounds for manslaughter and considers it all murder.

this way real debaters can down vote them to keep them from reaching 500 points Uhhh... that's not how the point system works. If you down-vote someone, that person doesn't lose a point from their total, only from their argument.	Ah I see, but the troll will have a slower climb to 500 points right?	2
The premise of this debate doesn't make much sense, because the two aren't mutually exclusive. What about science literature?	True, i had a similar thought when i first received this topic myself.	2
As a coincidence, yes. However, atheists will not profess to follow the universal moral standards that are accepted by society. Rather, they interpret them. As such, they do not follow their own morals, but rather interpretations of those.	Society has nothing in and of itself for it is a conglomerate of individuals and it is those people which posses morals.	2
I think it does, but of course there is an escape route. Divine Command Theory.	So God can do what he wants, because he is God, and it is correct? Surely that leads to the idea that it is good for us to do such a thing also? Either it is good or it is bad, it must be true for all people, and such an action being good would contradict other statements on morality. And, it's violated by the Euthypro Dilemma. The only escape route I could think of was the idea that Isaac wouldn't have known his own devotion unless challenged in such a way, and by God's actions, he was benefited overall. Seems very much to be clutching at straws though, as he was pretty committed to begin with in the story.	2
Sure you can. You can deem one to be more logical than the others.	Assuming you are not using Logic as your own opinionated way of reasoning. (which is contradictory) Prove it :D	2
The only way to remedy the problem is to elect Libertarian candidates, but considering the majority of Americans are brain dead, we will continue to be trampled by government destruction of individual liberty. This is how government sees liberty. Those in government believe you have too much freedom, and they are the solution in which there is not enough violence and coercion directed at you, so they pass more laws.	"Exactly, the American people are lethargic and unresponsive. We r give extremely poor choices in our elections, in which we r forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. The electoral college is the government's way of saying ""we don't trust you because we think the people r too stupid to vote properly"", the only way make a difference with ur ""popular vote"" is to vote for an independed or 3rd party. I hate to tell u guys, ur vote doesn't mean anything, unless it is for a third party, it almost like they r saying "" oh that's nice, but we r going to do this"", it is an illusion of freedom and liberty. Vote for the libertarian party or any other 3rd party that u find agreeable, if a 3rd party can generate 15% of the popular vote then they are able to participate in presidential debates and in general elections. people please make ur vote count! Vote for a third party, if u don't, ur vote means nothing. We r in a struggle and a war for our rights, freedoms and liberties, all that we hold dear... Well what we r suppose to hold dear. Does anyone even remember the original purpose? Have u all forgotten our cause?"	2

Sure my name is either Anthony Burgess, or Stanley Kubrick, the line is from the movie '‎A Clockwork Orange', which was adapted from Burgess's novella by the same title.

"@Idiotobx914: 1) I must be misunderstanding what existential nihilism is, or you are misunderstanding what it means to have no explanation. What the Cosmological argument means by ""explanation"" is like this: You are on this earth because your parents had sex and gave birth to you. Now it gets more complicated and more intricate when you go further back in time, but that is essentially what I mean by explanation. Not that we have a purpose necessarily. 2) What is the very high likelyhood of some sort of God existing? 3)I agree with that. But the existence of a God isn't necessarily illogical. 4)Ok. What does this have to do with the debate? 5) It doesn't matter to me what ""gender"" God has. I believe that if one exists it is most likely above our comprehension. I suppose it would have been more ""correct"" for me to refer to God as ""it."""	The actual likely-hood of god existing is actually zero due to absolutely no proof pointing to existence of a superior being. The existence of god is purely illogical, because as said before there has been absolutely no proven evidence. For me not being an Agnostic, I'm not sure what it has to do with the debate either, you brought it up.	2
If you say so, but I disagree. ;) What about bacon. People who follow Jesus get to eat bacon. That's why.	No, Jews still were suggested to not eat pork, gentiles could though, but they already could.	2

lol MEN STUFF.  It's a pre workout drink you take and its what your body uses as fuel so you can work out harder and longer.

Show evidence that god does exist. 	"You did not do a single thing I asked of you. People claim that they have evidence that points to his nonexistence. So show me the evidence. That is all I ask.

Or do you wish for me to show you why I believe emotion exists? Sure, explain. 	Emotion: The affective aspect of consciousness : feeling  b : a state of feeling  c : a conscious mental reaction (as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong feeling usually directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body By this definition, if you ever respond to a stimuli and it affects your state of consciousness you are experiencing emotion.	2
14 year olds aren't really mature at that time of age but I think it would be best if they started once they are in high school to get their permit.

I never really wanted to learn how to drive back then, but was kinda forced.	2
None is obviously more logical than Christianity. The bible is Christianity, and the Bible is constantly being proven wrong, or updated to go along with science. This debate, with three options, seems more suited for a perspective debate, considering I'd put Christianity as a more logical choice than Islam.

I can't understand why this has been voted down but no counter arguments presented. Fact: Humans reach puberty as early as age 8. Fact: Puberty causes severe hormonal changes and sexual curiosity results. Fact: Adolescents' brains have not fully developed the decision-making center making them more prone to spontaneous behavior. Fact: Abstinence training doesn't work on teens. Fact: Condoms do. Conclusion: Allowing adolescents access to condoms is the most logical means to preventing pregnancy, AIDS, and other STDs. So, all you who voted me down, where's the problem?	@ Tamisan I can't agree more so there you got your vote up. I also don't see why school wouldn't allow the distribution of condoms if they are also well aware that most of the teens has most ranging hormones as compared before due to their easy access of media. They might have been prevented most of the abortion cases that occur mostly in teens. 	2

initial argument itself was just as much and indirect and off topic post as mine was Yes, that's true, but he made a good point.

I've spoken to experts in this field who have told me that according to fossil records apart from size the crocodilians we see today have hardly changed since the time of the dinosaurs but that they also share the same common ancestor with birds	Crocodiles themselves have hardly changed since the age of the dinosaurs. And no, crocodilians are not closer to dinosaurs than birds. Birds themselves are not even a different group from the dinosaurs.	2
What if it is like the plague simulator in Plague Inc? I think it may be possible.	Holy shit! I didn't even know you liked plague inc. That games awesome! Infact i used it in an example in one of your debates ^_^ and seen this later. Also, Scientists have been genetically engineering viruses for a long time now. If they really wanted too (or due to some accident reminiscent of the Resident Evil games {I.E global catastrophe due to a bio hazard outbreak}) they could kill us all no problem and a select few in government or rich people would maybe beable to survive it... maybe.	2
If one side can use their book, the other side can use theirs. Fair is fair.	Yeah if one person is able to make a choice thEN the rest are too.  FAIR IS FAIR.  LOLOLOL	2
Bwhahaha! That's a joke, right? The iBoard might be cool though and something like that might be really handy for teachers to use in the classroom.	hey look at the second one you can literally walk the internet. LOL	2
Sure. The Earth has a magnetic field. This is why a compass works. The magnetic field can shift. It can also increase and decrease in strength. This magnetic field deflects some of the sun's harmful rays. If the strength of the magnetic field drops, more rays make it to the surface and Earth gets warmer. If the field drops to zero, we roast and bake.	Well... if that ever happens at least I'll get a nice looking tan for once. :)	2
How is my brain stupid? Mind explaining that? Actually don't. I don't want to hear crap.	What are you going to hear? We're typing letters. See...stupid!	2
homosexual are not equal as it is right now, so saying they should have more rights can mean they can finally have equal rights as well. So far people see gay's as less equal then str8 people. Only because they str8 people as natural and there's a lot more of that going on then homosexuallty. I'm just asking, should they be givin some more right's then they don't yet have that str8 people do?	"Gay people do not have ""less rights"" than straight people. They have the same rights, they just chose not to exercise some rights and what they want, instead, is amended rights. For example, gay people have the right to marry (just like everyone else) as long as it is with a person of the opposite sex. Gays chose not to exercise that right (for obvious reasons) and so they want to amend the ""right"" to marry. I used ""right"" in quotes because I don't see how marriage is a right.  Think about this, is driving a right or a privilege? If it is a right, then why do we need to file for a driver's license?  How about the right to pursue happiness? We don't need a license for that.  How about marriage? We do need a license for that."	2
She ended up being a HE lol.	Wait what?	2
If you killed, murdered, tortured and raped, then why on earth do you deserve to live? when you have taken others' right to live?	Yes, It's true that they don't deserve to live, but why stoop to their level by killing them.	2
Yepp. And I am still not over that silly name, eggplant. I mean, what the fudge?	Eggplants are neither oval-shaped like an egg, nor white. So how did it happen that these vegetables were given a name with the word egg in it? Eggplants came from Asia, and were popular in the Near East long before they reached Europe. Then, in the Middle Ages, traders brought a certain kind of eggplant to Europe, a rare white variety shaped just like a chicken egg. So the vegetable was called eggplant, and the name stuck, even when the familiar purple eggplant reached Europe years later. Eggplants were also called mad apples in some places, because people thought that eating an eggplant would make you go insane! Centuries ago, Chinese women used a dye taken from the eggplant to stain their teeth black!	2
I agree, but I don't feel like one state would break us...in fact another 50 states probably wouldn't break us. Just look at this map:	Yeah, we're still the richest country overall by a couple trillion (Japan is second about 2 trillion behind, followed by Germany, then China) Of course we owe Japan and China about 4.5 trillion, so maybe we should just give them each a state and call it even. I vote for West Virginia and Mississippi. (They're our poorest states, we'll play them like we played the indians.)	2
I like the part where god kills everyone. And destroys villages. And transfigures people into salt blocks. Why salt? Who knows.	Why do you like the part where God kills everyone?	2
What is wrong with you how do you put people out of their missery what are you a mass murderer?? Thants sick life is worth the stress and if its not than why are you here??!!!	i think life is worth alot and now one should kill a next man	2
And by the way, I just looked at your link and each of the world's regions is majority Christian, besides Asia Pacific and Middle East/North Africa. I'm also pretty sure that you live in either Europe or North America. Europe is 90% Christian and North America is over 77% Christian... so by those stats, I'm pretty sure that you're going to come across mostly Christians.	I do realize that, but I am not sure what your point is.	2
It's completely ethical. In some views wrong but ethical... there's nothing that tops it	There is nothing wrong! with eugenics! It's when people commit genocide that they (people) become wrong! You can't just kill off a large portion of the gene pool cause you want to and human genes keep changing so who knows perhaps the gene pool might come in handy in the future! Eugenics should not be used as a means to separate people or treat people differently.	2
According to holy Quran he was one of greatest prophet.he was given a holy book bible.	So was what He claimed true or false?	2

I thought that there's going to be another series. Gun Gale Online.	That was 'going' to be the next season. Gun Gale Online is actually what kirrito (However you spell his name) was going to play next. Check out the magna. As of what I know, they're done. (Or else they would have started the next season already, it's been way too long)	2
Well, there is a thing called Geology... and it does include hell 'cause, you know, it's science. Seriously. You must be a troll. This is simply far too stupid to be something else.	Wait? Are you calling me a troll? Or Srom? I mean, I pretty much am a troll but not because of this debate.... I'm just posting what Srom said because it's one of the most f*cking ridiculous things I've ever heard on the internet.	2
Also you can talk to the person in real life or meet up with them in real life instead of texting. Also if you text to much you are still looking on a screen and if you text a lot then you could also get glasses. You thumbs can also hurt if you text to much and you can get brain cancer if you text to much because people are soo focused on there phones. You know if a EMP hits the US then all the electronic stuff like TV,Computers, Cell Phones and all the othe electronic items will not work. Thats why you should carry a watch around your wrist instead of a phone.	But if you meet up with someone in real life then you'll have to deal with them in real time. You can't tell them that your minutes ran out or that your battery ran low.... it's like.... they're like right there ;)	2

"""And once the illegals take over the U.S...... ;)"" if your going to use that logic then we might as well consider all those Muslims immigrating everywhere and setting up there mosques and things"	Muslim is not a language, it's a religion. So..., if the world had to follow one religion, which would it be? ;)	2
I think Iran's leader and North Korea's leader are both suicidal maniacs capable of starting WW3	That is definately true, but I still do not think it is going to happen. NK is to small with to little amount of allies, compared to the US. Both countries could start WWIII but something could happen to another country that could start a WWIII but I think that it will not be in the next 10 years.	2
"It may have been made for a man and a woman but it needs to adapt to a society where men and women aren't the only ones dating. Things used to be made for blacks only or for whites only but they adapted. Look, I don't really care about gay marriage, I think there are more important problems right now then Gay marriage. Ohhohohoh, look what we have here. A ""Shut up...that's why"" argument. It's one where you feel that the point shouldn't go on anymore so you try to stop it, in this case by addressing a more serious issues. Yet, to gay people who want to get married but can't, this is a more important issue. That, ""Let's talk about something else"" argument only works if you really leave the issue alone, yet the people against equal marriage rights, never leave the issue alone, hence the reason it's still a 'problem'."	Okay, let North Korea bomb us we have to deal with Gay marriage, let everyone lose there home, we have to focus on Gay marriage, how in any way is this important [at this time] look we should focus on it when we don't have North Korea threatning us with Nukes or when we start getting more money, instead of spending it all!	2
I really don't buy that Iran is out to ONLY make green energy. I think they want the bomb.	I completely agree. And I also simultaneously know that Israel has already finalized its plan to strike Iran with nuclear tipped missiles. What I don’t know, however, is what will trigger the execution of that plan. Obviously we are not, as a country, troubled by Israel’s plan to bomb Iran, with nuclear weapons, but we certainly are troubled by Iran’s intention to finalize the necessary parts for a plan to bomb Israel.  Did I ever mention that I am impervious to fear and war-mongering?  Also, did you know that there is a population of about 25,000 Jews in Iran who are quite comfortable living in Iran? It’s as though 25,000 Jews are telling the world that they feel safe and sound in their home, Iran, despite what the world press and media fills the air-waves with. Hell, the damned constitution of Iran protects, specifically, Jews. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews  Note: Without taking the time to cite the source, I do know that Israel will pay Jews to move to the mother-land. Yet, there are very few takers. Take that for what it is worth.	2
I accendentially commented the same comment twice, and I don't know how to delete an argument.  Can someone tell me how?	As far as i know only andy has the ability to delete arguments from debates.	2
No one know why the person you speak of does anything... I wouldn't worry about it, he's just a raving lunatic that no one takes seriously.	It's funny how the person he describes is you when I joined.	2
"This reminds me of this ancient book called The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Many gems wait to be mined from this book :) One of the primary principles proposed in it is that the only way a general can get the best out of a conflict is to avoid it. This seems in tune what you have been saying about Jiu Jitsu. Actually The philosophy of Jiu-Jitsu isn't really about avoiding conflict, but engaging in conflict in as honorable a manner as our skills allow. Many, if not most mammals, tumble around and play in a feisty but gentle manner with each other. I have a small kitten and a puppy who are awesome Jiu Jitsu training partners. Avoiding conflict is by no means always the wisest option. Much of the beauty of Jiu Jitsu is the ability to overcome brutality with artful and gentle technique, and where you can, you should. We JJ folk get excited at the prospect of getting into conflicts where we can showcase our arts beauty and effectiveness. This relates to the Jiu Jitsu mentality of always seeking an end to violence. You never stray from that goal.  it is wrong to be enslaved by pre-determined strategy. Violence cannot be part of the strategy. The general has to make the best out of the information he has in the present; if his initial strategy was to make a series of six complicated moves, then he shouldn't stick to that plan if he could see that he could end the conflict in two. This is thickly emphasized in The Art of War. Related to debates, this means that you shouldn't plan two or three or four pairs of answers ahead and blindly stick to that idea, if you can see that things aren't going as anticipated. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't plan ahead, it just means that you mustn't stick to your plan when the present scenario contradicts what you had hoped for.  A serious thing to realize is that many of the most important lessons we learn are through extended conflicts. Conflicts are definitely not something we should attempt to do away with because they are a key means of growth and development. However we would be wise to quickly bring an end to violence in conflict. The spirited contest is a fountain of truth, that is poisoned by violence. With violence out of the picture, conflict is to be savored. One of the things I like the best about The Art of War is that it teaches a general that he must give his opponent a noble exit. If the general can't 'take whole' the enemy (i.e. disarm, make the enemy surrender, or exterminate without losing any of the general's men (like 3 men surrounded by a hundred)), then the enemy should be able to back off. Directly related to this is that the enemy mustn't be cornered or they will fight with desperation like people who has got nothing to lose. I have seen that roughly the same holds for debating. Unless you have irrefutably arguments (both in a rational and rhetorical sense), then it simply won't work not to leave things open-ended. Unless no one can disagree with you, you shouldn't insist that someone is invariably wrong. You must always give your opponent the opportunity to back off, even when that involves your opponent taking a cheap shot at you. This is interesting as it applies to training in JJ. There are some interesting dynamics at play in the training match. In my classes I start students in specific advantageous/disadvantageous positions (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_mount'>such as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_control'>and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(grappling'>and)) and instruct them to do their best to either escape or maintain these starting positions. It's much harder work to escape the disadvantaged position than to maintain the advantaged position and I find that training is more effective the less you are -allowed- to succeed and the more your opponent makes you earn it. Strangely enough, this means that they are better off training with someone closer to their own skill level than directly with me because they would get extremely discouraged trying to improve position. There's been many times that beginners ""fight with desperation"" trying to escape these positions, and I simply love being involved in training desperation out of people. In fact, I must admit, this brings to light how training Jiu-Jitsu on the mat is superior in a sense to the ""verbal Jiu-Jitsu"" of a debate. On the mat, poor technique is almost never effective. :) Do you know if Jiu Jitsu is just as hard to get good at? People who make their living teaching Jiu-Jitsu (And Aikido as well) have a vested interest in slow advancement of rank. However, I can tell you that it is possible to become proficient in Jiu-Jitsu in a relatively short period of time. I'd estimate about 6 months to a year if you aren't in bad shape, and you have access to good training partners. If you are seriously interested in taking a class, I can give you advice on how to get the most for your money, as prices are generally kind of steep. My unfettered opinion is that Jiu-Jitsu (And I heavily favor the Brazillian variety) is what Aikido pretends to be. Please do tell me if you decide to try it, as I'd like to dump some information on you before you sign up."	The spirited contest is a fountain of truth, that is poisoned by violence. With violence out of the picture, conflict is to be savored. I think this is very true. It has to be the right kind of conflict. For instance, I don't think anyone got anything particularly good out of the Vietnam war (apart from maybe the military-industrial complex). We have to be ready for when conflict is inevitable I think; we can't always avoid it. to overcome brutality with artful and gentle technique, and where you can, you should. Could it be said that it's a matter of intention? You shouldn't go into a conflict with the intention of harming, because that would turn the scenario into the wrong kind of conflict. Please do tell me if you decide to try it, as I'd like to dump some information on you before you sign up. I am sure going to ask you when it gets a bit more relevant. During the next couple of months I am moving to a different place, and I am going to start studying somewhere else as well, so I need a bit of time to get accustomed to all that. I always liked the idea of martial arts, so I am probably going to start practicing something in the future. So thanks for the opportunity.	2
I guess but he is very tempting... what if he makes an offer that you simply can't refuse?	Tempting is not the same thing as making someone do something.  	2
Should be obvious. Ghosts are gray, angels are white, demons are red.  I have evidence. ^^	What great use of words that mad me laugh hard.	2
I already received 2 down-votes and 1 upvote. I know that as a Christian debater I get tons of down-votes and when an non-believer says his thing they get 2+ up votes why cant I get 2+ upvotes. :( Everytime when I debate an atheist someone seems to look at our arguments and they tent to upvote the athiest but not the Christian or when I get an up-vote they down-vote me immediately.	Well.... you don't see me running around fighting for gay rights... I'm pretty apathetic on most social issues but:  Those people disgust me That's a pretty hateful statement to make. I hope if you have a gay child some day, you don't tell them that they disgust you. EDIT: to add... who cares about the up/down votes?	2
I think this one is more appropriate.	lol yeah, that'sa good one. i suppose i was being generous with something tasteful.	2
I am angry at God right now. :'(	You're not the only one. Why might I ask are you feeling Vengeful at God? You think you might want to Smite him with your Wrath?	2
Then I suppose I should clarify the question. In general do we do immoral things because we really want to cause serious harm, or because we fail to see the seriousness of the harm the immoral behavior causes? I understand that sometimes it is the former, and sometimes it is the latter, but which is more commonplace?	The better in point A, for my statement, is that of being better for oneself. As in it is better for me to steal X because I have no money and need some; however, it is not better for others, nor morally better. The better in the second sense is that of doing that which is better morally.	2
"""Its when Columbus discovered the new world which is the USA"" This is for most part true. ""if it wasn't for him to discover it then we would be in a different country and not free."" No thats not true at all, you can't say what would or wouldn't have happened had columbus not discovered the new world. One thing is for certain it would have still been discovered. Also, Columbus had nothing to do with freedom, he subjected the native populations to abominable treatment, he slaughtered thewm at will and used their livers to makes purses, and puches. He authorised the most barbaric treatment, and was responsible cruel punishment of the natives as he considered them animals and uncivilised. Not very Christian if you ask me. ""Thank You Jesus for Christopher Columbus "" Those two men existed in different time peridos, therefore they never came into contact with one another, therefore Jesus had nothing to do with Columbus discovering the new world."	"I don't know about the whole ""Christopher Columbus discovered America""....But for the most part I agree with what you're saying."	2
You're an alcoholic. 	What's your point?	2
Lol, oookay then.  You're kind of the pervert on this site aren't you? There's always one	True...., but I'm so old I can't remember how to do it any more. They tell me that it's like ridding a bicycle..... except I don't remember any pedaling being involved ;)	2
I highly doubt I am dude.  	Wait? Are you being sarcastic again?	2
My honest opinion is that when non-believers who don't believe in Jesus Christ and they die they will go to hell because they choose not to believe in Christ but if they repent and turn from their sins and believe in Jesus Christ then they can go to heaven.	So you have good people going to hell for eternity, just because they don't believe that Jesus was divine? Also can I ask how you square an omniscient God with a God who is supposed to be all good. If he is omniscient than he would know since the beginning who would accept Jesus. How can a good God still create people with the knowledge that they will burn in hell for an eternity?	2
Well at least you can admit that it's your religion. Though my atheist compadres on this site tell me that the parts of the bible condemning homsexuality is apart of Leviticus, a portion that Christians don't seem to follow, except for that one part.	But I'm not a perfect christian, and I like women not men that is my really main reason though	2
Yes another good reason where it would be morally acceptable	Why did you respond to me twice? One was enough you know that.	2
Thats right baby, but you still love me! Don't deny it, you will now switch over to Pepsi LOL	Well, if we get married, don't be expecting diamonds.... that's all I can say. ;) EDIT: I was replying to you comment about beaded necklaces not this... I don't know what happened?	2
Hey man, you might want to consider what it means if your friend, who is also a girl, recommends 'Pretty Little Liars', to you.

I had thought that the way in which I had written it was a display of irony. Basically, I said why non-Christians dislike Christians and then, being a Christian, I write the exact sentiments by which Christians regard non-Christians. However, I do still believe that Christians are far more tolerant than Muslims. By the way, why do you so loathe generalizations? You bring it up at every opportunity.	"I had hoped you were making some kind of joke (there needs to be some kind of sarcasm/Irony emoticon you can put after text so people know what tone to read it in). I bring it up at every opportunity I see it because I think it is one of the largest problems we have on this site, and one of the key reasons why we have conflicts (or at least something that can exponentiate their severity). When we disagree with what someone says or believes, we like to then imagine that they have other flaws, and that everyone that shares these same beliefs also shares these flaws. In short we demonize groups, and when you demonize something, you become blinded and can justify terrible actions against it. Can you imagine trying to kill innocent people if you hadn't already prejudged them as guilty in some way just because of the belief system to which they subscribed, the political views they held or their country of origin? Of course you can't, and neither can any other sane human being. So too do generalizations make political discourse so frustratingly impossible. People demonize their opponents and therefore will be blinded to what their ""opponents"" are doing right, and will try to irrationally defend the actions of those who agree with them. Also, yes I think that free speech is being attacked by some Muslims, whereas Christians in the west haven't posed a serious threat to that particular pillar of our democracy."	2
I want a chance for 6 years in office. That would be cool. Can you imagine me in office ;)	I can definitely imagine you in office! You'd be one of those crazy senators proposing bills to outlaw things like horse-on-goat sex, or pickled peanuts or something.	2
"Exactly! Youre just assuming. You dont know what it was made for, maybe Im right. I see ""createdebate"" and think, this is a site where people can argue, you see it and think....what exactly?"	You no what? You're right. Yet you just admitted that you are also assuming so you are not necessarily correct.	2
Seriously people? All these post and not one mention of Nietzsche?  (I can't say it enough; READ A BOOK!)	He's a great philosopher, one of my favorites. Oddly enough no one here knows of him.	2
You can't assume that all religions have the same view of god it all depends on which religion you consider. I can only argue for Christianity.So... In Christianity I would say that God is a male. Christianity tells us that the trinity is 3 in one which means that God is 100% Jesus 100% God and 100% Holy spirit. Which then means that God=Jesus=Holy Spirit. Jesus was a male so if then by definition God=male=Holy spirit.	I didn't ask based on a religion. I asked if you thought one way or the other on a creator.	2
"Diversity of opinion and independence are two of the 4 characteristics of a ""wise crowd.""  So, yes, under perfect conditions, a large body of Individuals probably can make a decision much better than one individual. The problem is that groups inevitably bring with them a psychological dynamic that tends to discourage individual views and independent thinking.  Knowledge is the key. Groups are unavoidable and can be beneficial, as long as everyone understands the importance of protecting alternative viewpoints."	Good theory. Do you think that the groupthink psychological dynamic be contained or mitigated at least?	2

"Yes and no.  Yes because there are instances that happened that the media/government has either not explained, nor have given the ""full"" detail to what happened on that day.  For example: Apparently, there seems to be eye witness accounts at the scene (a boy and a bystander (citizen) whom both claimed they saw a man handcuffed being walked to a police car; wearing cargo pants and a black shirt.  There is an apparent air (helicopter) footage of another person being chased by a couple cops, and they seemed to have caught him/her and arrested him/her.  Why was this not mentioned at all?  Also, apparently other than a few children claiming to have seen ""a man"" come into certain classrooms with a gun, NONE of them claimed to have seen the man actually fire his/her weapon. A bit strange, but nothing too crazy.  The parents of the deceased did not see any photographs of the bodies.  Odd. There are accounts of people helping the children, yet neither the parents (of the helped children) nor anybody else have thanked or even mentioned these claims of the so-called helpers.  Not too strange, perhaps poor media coverage (say it ain't so).  Apparently, the car that was said to be registered to the main suspect was actually apparently registered to another man (known felon) whom was not in the state at the time.  Weird.  The Medical Examiner has apparently stated that the majority of the deceased had gunshot wounds equivalent to that of long rifle wounds (AR-15 I believe), yet when they found the suspect, he had small firearm wound(s). It is believed that they found four small firearms within the school and found a long rifle in the trunk of the car.  Whaaaa...?  So basically, I'm not stating that the events never took place or that people did not die, I believe there were brutal events that took place on that day.  However, considering the facts that are available to the public online, a little research brings light to more questions than answers.  And no, because these above said instances could very well be misinformation and mishandling of the actual facts that happened on that day.  Either way, innocent people died surrounding the Sandy Hook ordeal, and that is quite unfortunate and very sad. I hope the families and friends of the victims find peace and serenity however way possible."	Hell just froze over. I actually agree with you. o.O	2
No... the arrow isn't pointed at you. And it doesn't matter because you are completely pointless anyway. I don't even know why you're on CD? I guess getting points is a thrill to you because there is no other reason for you to be here. You take no stands on anything... I guess because you're afraid of being beat on an issue? Or you just don't understand any issues? I don't know.	No... the arrow isn't pointed at you  Oh, but the arrow is pointing off the left of the screen, so all I have to do is turn my computer and the arrow is pointed at me. I don't even know why you're on CD?  Why are you asking me? Shouldn't you know what you know? I guess because you're afraid of being beat on an issue? Or you just don't understand any issues?  I don't know. At least you are intelligent enough to know that.	2
Okay. I was sitting down and for some reason I closed my eyes. I had a vision of the most God aweful ugly creature you could imagine. I understand if you don't believe me.	I believe you. I don't think you saw Satan though. I think you just have a wild imagination.	2

Why would he not like his socks?  	SockPuppet Accounts ;) not socks XD	2
Having been here over three years, it's not surprising. Createdebate goes through it's ups and downs.	Well i been here 2 years and i think this is one of the downs by the year 2013 we be ready for new debate topics	2
I thought he died a while ago in the hospital..... whoops......................	I thought he was already dead too! x____x So...apparently we're both insensitive, terrible people. :P I mean, not really. Except now I am.  I actually do care though. Just 'cause a part of me usually cares when someone dies.  Wow that was so deep. >_> (understand the sarcasm, please)	2
haha cool nice to meet you. I'm one of the Christians on this site. Gee looks like Ive got more tough competition XD.	Nice to meet you too bro.......................................  :)	2
"The question was regarding the capacity for judgment of groups vs individuals - which I read as the ability to make smart, humane choices. Not to simply perform work of some kind.  That reminds me of another debate elsewhere, in which offshore outsourcing was praised for it's salutary effect on an abstract entity known as, ""the economy."" My question, then as now, is: what about the human cost? The Nazis were infamous for their ""efficiency."""	congress - one word, end argument	2
I wish to Conserve the Constitution and American Individual Rights. That's about it. I don't believe in Family Values or Tradition. And I certainly don't give two shits about the environment or animal rights. The only reason why I'm green is to CONSERVE my money and resources. Don't want to Conserve life. I believe in all positions that are Pro-Death (Euthanasia, death penalty, abortion). Although, i do believe that there are some people out there who are not conservative at all.	I don't believe in Family Values or Tradition. Why not?	2
WHY NOT I HEARD THERE WAS GOING TO BE AWESOME FEATURES AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU SHOULD REALLY BUY ONE CAUSE IT LOOKS SO COOL AND AWESOME SO YOU SHOULD BUY ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Okay... now I really want to buy one.	2
We go to school to learn a new lessons not to care about our make-up and how does it look ! :)	That's what I'm really agreeing about . School is for learning not for showing who's the beautiful here . And every girl should trust her normal fetuer .	2
Then charcoal is what you get when you toast toast! 'Yay'!	Lol. Yep.	2
Moral consequentialism ftw .	"Yea, I was considering just calling it ""Utilitarianism vs Deontologism"", but I realize not everyone would understand that, so I took a version of a scenario we all know."	2
We don't need that organic crap! We can make our own vitamins and minerals! Which is how I think most of america feels about it.	Ha ha, I know, right? .	2
Uhhhh.... and then what happens dawg? Don't leave us hangin'...	I hope that she got her butt back after done laughing.--------------------	2
Definition of art: [noun] the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.	Well then according to this would you agree that the art should be valued according to the amount of imagination and creative skill that was put into the piece?	2
Ahh, Casper, are you okay ?	I figured since intelligence won't drive the dumb away, maybe crazy will.	2
"First off: that graphic is hilarious.  On to the topic: To me it depends what my job entails. At my current job: hell no. But if my future career path is what I'm aiming for, ""getting ahead"" might (theoretically) mean having a chance to make the world around me a better place. In that scenario, the ends would justify the means and I wouldn't even think about dignity."	About a year ago I had a boss that was a complete bitch. Everyone hated her and gave her push back about everything. I finally realized that wasn't doing me any good so I just started agreeing with her on everything while not really changing my own behaviors... She stopped giving me any trouble at all even though my actions didn't really change... only my words did. I never had any other problems with her and I still did things the way I wanted to. I didn't really get ahead but it improved my time at work greatly just by saying some words that didn't cost me a dime.	2
YES!!!! but not before we see some boobies first ;) www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Who_wants_to_see_LizziexLaura_s_boobies	Guys I'm being serious right now. Stop dicking around for 5 seconds and realize the situation we are in.	2
"Wow. I commend your bravery if what you say is how you feel. But then I oppose to your views them selves. I mean to say something like "" Jews aren't people and mean nothing"" is something that.. Well isn't a very nice thing to say *cough cough understatement..."	Well, we all know you're an antisemitic so.....	2
Now I do hope you're bullshitting..! Either you've turned in to a douchebag troll, or you're come out, as a hater of all things unconventional. Either way, what the fudge? Maybe Hellno was right, I am not observant at all.. What happened Intangible? You used to be a nice kid, now you've grown up in to a d!ck :P	I am bullshitting 87.62% of the time when I am on this site... I just like to deep my fingers in people's mind butter. Otay? :)	2
They are half a species. 50% there. 	half a species doesn't make it one you fucking nagging headache bastard hole!	2

King Louis XIV of France didn't have this problem. He reign for a long time because the base religion was wide spread. So other religions wouldn't matter. Also absolute monarchs were quite well of and didn't have many problems. As for North Korea.....they keep starting some. I do see a point in your post though.	Where is king louis now, I mean where is his reign? I know he's dead, but the reign lives on in the generations passed down, so where is he?	2
Ain't it wonderful? Thank God for Al Gore inventing the internet for us, LOL!	Riight? Loners like me can't find drama of this quality anywhere else.  At least not any that I can participate in. x)	2
So the only difference is some form of healthcare card?	I have no idea. But whatever the difference is, I'm sure it ain't good ;)	2
Well I guess that counts, if not accepting Jesus is a sin.	Sin in hebrew, means 'without the share(of God)'. So no accepting Jesus is 'Without the share'. As a Christian, I believe that if you aceapt Jesus, he is put in your place, so that we are not relying on ourselves no to sin, but on Jesus.	2
I doubt he'll do anything... he said his developer was MIA and I don't think he wants to spend any money on the site right now. Jc will get tired soon enough. He always does. lol	Guys, this is a good idea. My developer is no longer MIA, but is daughter is really sick so he hasn't been able to help at all. I am transitioning day to day development to a set of offshore resources (over a 90% discount from going rates), but this will take a while. I will do my best to get something put in place, the balance is that educators use the site and they have students vote from day one. But, I have an idea to fix that too! Just give me a few more weeks. Thanks, Andy	2
Maybe you should try talking to it...	I haven't seen one but I would probably would have travel to the country to where Moses was or research the burning bush.	2
Pumpkin avocados?	Fatkidsinjellatoes? 	2
You should probably remember we're sticking to traditional vampires. So no incredible super-speed that Mr. Cullen possesses. Though on the bright side the traditional vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, and mist. wonders if anyone will notice the irony	actually traditional vampires have no relation to bats or wolves.	2
I don't always buy pizza..., but when I do..., it's square ;)	I don't always buy circular pizza, but when do, I cut my slices into triangles.	2
"The dog could, ""file for divorce"" by running away. Many would say physical communication is much more direct than verbal communication.  When you are in a close loving relationship with someone, is it not often true that you can sense something is wrong before they tell you in words?"	"The dog could, ""file for divorce"" by running away. If a dog could engage in a marriage like human beings, then it should be under the same marriage laws as human beings. Meaning that it should file a divorce as human beings file divorces."	2
I think you need to take a break... you've got problems lol.	This was actually hilarious to read. Taking semantics to a whole new level.	2
Oh! Shucks! Intangible is Down-Voting all my arguments again! I guess I hit a nerve again? LOL	I got your back ;)	2
I don't even remember celebrating my birthday as a kid, at least not after I was eight or so.	Well..., tell us when your birthday is and we'll celebrate it here on CD ;)	2
I don't like liberals, but I find it fun to watch them as they screw up the country. You are free to remove yourself from our internet.	:) i like this. you have to know about the internet's development though to get it.	2
Think you'll find you did say that nor you nor anyone else cared about my opinions, before I said.. Whatever I've forgotten now anyway. So Ja...	I said what I said before you said what you said, but you were talking about how you felt in the past about me. So, you were mean to me when you viewed me as dribbling a while back before I said what I said. So, you were mean first because you viewed me that way before even though I said the insult first.	2
This is absolute nonsense!	This debate is nonsense ;)	2
Batman is just as much of a murderous madman, hanging people from planes, crushing them with statues and in junkyards, impaling them on swords, starving them to death and burning them to death whilst getting laid in front of their burning bodies amongst other killings. ://www.cracked.com/article20111the-6-most-brutal-murders-committed-by-batman.html  He also dragged a criminal through a plate glass window and gave him the choice to either bleed to death or tell him what he wanted to know and thats just the comics. In the 1989 movie he killed the Joker even stating his intention and in Batman returns fries one of the Penguins henchmen with the Batmobiles engine and shoves a bomb down a strongmans trousers before kicking him down a drain to explode, this last killing even makes him grin the man's psychotic.	That article is hysterical. And I thought he was some super do good, never killed anyone, type of guy.	2
Please Explain	What i mean is..... how do you really know that every adult began as a child? We have no proof or evidence. That is a flaw. So that is what i am truly saying to you.  Like a red apple. If you open your eyes, it is red. But if you close you eyes, is the apple still red? It is philosophy stuff xD.  My logic agrees with yours if i don't dig deep down. A better example would be....what about the first person ever to live in this world? The first creature? How was they born? Did they began as a child? It is like what came first...the chicken or the egg? In this case, what came first, the child or the adult?	2
Stalin opened up markets to a greater degree of free trade to increase production to suit the economic condition. To increased the peasants' incentive to produce, so after the drought and famine of 1921-22, production jumped 40% the following season, Stalin impose a tax on peasants. Hence Stalin's economic policies make make him a worthy idol for the Russians.	How does opening a new market make Stalin a worth idol? Are you stupid? Jesus H. Christ.	2
"Sure, they could follow the same morals;  That doesn't mean the morals they follow are ""God's"" but rather that the morals which are theirs is the same."	As a coincidence, yes. However, atheists will not profess to follow the universal moral standards that are accepted by society. Rather, they interpret them. As such, they do not follow their own morals, but rather interpretations of those.	2
A cop is going to shoot a black person for looking into his mother's car though. <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/roy-middleton-shot-by-cops_n_3682680.html'>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/roy-middleton-shot-by-cops n3682680.html	The link didn't work for me... but anyways, there are cops out there who shouldn't be cops. If he just shot this guy for no apparent reason other than he was searching through a car, then the cop should be fired and maybe even locked up. Just because one cop acts one way, doesn't mean all cops are like that. I'll have to read the article to get a better idea of what happened.	2
We should use the technology to solve medical problems, like a club foot or something. But not for things like eye color, Sometimes people need angst. If Einstein had been a model, I doubt he would have had time for all that science garbage. And what's with all the weird links and ads?	I totally agree wasn't a debate made just like this? >.> .< Just be another way of selectivity making uncustomized people outcasts in the long run. I mean it is fine for the health issues that a baby might have but making your baby look like what you want is wrong. Makes more ugly people in the world Pyg how are you gonna compete with the ladies when its you or the Adonnis next to you or the Adonnis next to him? etc etc	2
Sorry, but this is a fail. This is not Atheism attacking Christians. It is communists. It's a huge difference. If people find God in communist China, they may just realize that the government sucks and they need to revolt. The government banned religion as a form of control.	Yeah but to be honest, in contrast, I don't think it's really Christians attacking atheists. Maybe I'm wrong and going to hell (see what I did there?) but I just think people should be able to sincerely call themselves Christians yet knowingly persecute everyone that isn't.  I know it's obviously not the same situation, but those are just my thoughts.	2
Yes. And I just got pushed against a wall by her .	I am sorry. I hope you two can work this out and hopefully she acknowledges you a sister again.	2
Yes, there 'should' not be war, there 'should' not be conflicts. But humans can't always understand one another, and we all have our wants. Some conflicts can't be resolved peacefully because of this simple fact. Yes, it's sad. But what can one do? D:	One can only pray. That's what I do everyday .	2
"Great minds think alike. I was doing that while you were typing your suggestion. Now I'm listening to, ""I kissed a girl"" ;) Could you imagine a gay guy singing, ""I did a girl and I liked it"" ;)"	"Good now he doesnt have to. I did wonder for a moment why you hadnt already done so. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                         Gays kissing girls....and liking it....  I can even imagine the clip to go with it. Hey , maybe hmicciches' daughter and that space pop band can compile a rip for ""kissed a girl"" using this idea as inspiration. btw , I kissed a girl and i liked it."	2
Then you just have charcoal. A slice of charcoal.	Then charcoal is what you get when you toast toast! 'Yay'!	2
My cat is a bitch. I love her :3 They do pretty much take care of themselves. And I like how they leave you alone until you want to be left alone. It makes me smile.	Haah.! Iknoo wht yuu mean. My cat is tha same way., but i care about her alot.!! <3 :D Haha..	2
No. The proper balance is required to sustain a wheelie and it is posiible to slow down, stop and continue again while maintaining a wheelie. This is true at least on a bicycle.	LOL, right, that whole other side must have never done BMXing.	2
I suppose im just used to talking to hardened american nationalists on this site, God they stubborn.	I suppose.  I don't really talk about politics much, like I said.	2
Correct me if i'm wrong but is'nt it 2012 now? The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.	Yeah it is so 2012 already happened!  .	2
16, perhaps. Maybe 15. This was before your time, but we used to have some 10-year-olds.	16 should be the recommended age requirement. What next? Are infants being invited? Well, some of responses might as well be from infants or maybe an infant would have respond better.	2
That is a fair point and I certainly don't claim to have an answer. Well, except this one: the Bible is really hard to take seriously when you look at it skeptically and analytically.	Yeah... and what people fail to realize is that the Bible was written by men, not God or Jesus. Not even the apostles wrote it! The Gospel According to Mark (or whoever) is a title, not a reference to the author. For many years the gospels didn't even have titles. They were added later to increase the plausibility.	2
I do not want a guy who takes longer than I do to get ready to go out.	I agree. I don't like guys who take longer to get ready than I do. That said I don't like guys that are always getting into fights and think they have to prove that they are tough guys. I like guys who are smart, and don't feel like they have to prove anything to anyone.	2
I'm on the fence but I am sure that the right thing here is to say no.......	Yeah, I'm kind of on the fence too... I would almost always say no but I guess there could be a circumstance arise where I'd say do it.	2
Seriously Prodigee, go back to DDO and leave the nice people alone... take your frustrations out somewhere else. It's not our fault you're going to die a virgin.	The owner should give you or someone with a multitude of points moderater abilities. It only seems fair.	2
YES!!!! but not before we see some boobies first ;) www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Who_wants_to_see_LizziexLaura_s_boobies	Boobies then revolution, won't this cause a war for the right reasons.	2
General Sisi? Ha! That has to be the least intimidating name ever.	I heard that in Liberia there was a General Mosquito. He was overthrown by General Mosquito-Spray.	2
I was wondering were all the debates you usually make went, I was getting worried ;)	Lol, no chance of me leaving that quickly. I love the idea of this site, and most of the people (so far), and I'm hoping the number of people who participate does improve soon. So I'll stay. And if I leave Ill give you a warning XD	2
This person is saying they know that the matrix theory is bullshit. They are the one who is wrong.	Ohh, wow... I directed that at the wrong person... damn. For once sorry Prodigee, I totally replied to the wrong response lol.	2
DAMNIT SROM. Yes, you are COMPLETELY right, I think. I can't believe I am saying this, but I COMPLETELY agree with you. To modify a religion is to invent your own. The words of a god twisted and CHANGED is inventing a god. It is BLASPHEMY, even if neither gods actually exist. However, to change the words of a holy book to suit your agenda is NOT worshiping the same god. Srom, you are RIGHT this time. Ismaila CANNOT call herself a Christian yet spit at the Holy Book and spit at Jesus, who she claims to obey.	Thanks Emperor for supporting me!  	2
Trollzors ?	lolzors, but he is totally a troll, look at his ridiculous posts.	2
"I would say the ""New World"" would win. But then again I am biased because I think sense the US is the best nation on earth, they would win no matter what. The US would train the latin American countries army. Rely mostly on Venezuela's oil. The US would do most of the heavy duty, showing their air and sea superiority. South America would rely on Argentina and Brazil, while an attack on the US homeland would be almost impossible to accomplish."	Britain easily has sea superiority, and is defendable. American cities are easy targets, geographically.	2
Well I you're doing it just to burn fat and/or stay fit that's just fine. But to actually gain muscle it takes a system of ripping muscle and rebuilding it bigger.	Cavemen didn't use that :)	2
Me! Me! Me! Now if we can just do away with the School Uniform debates.	Like Totally, school uniforms are so juvenile. Debate something else.	2
You can say it. You probably shouldn't say it. I know you want the right to say it and you have it. But what would you use it for?	The same thing people use all words for; to convey information.	2
Oh there is persecution in America but its slowly coming and I can see it. Christians are being slowly persecuted in America because of people bullying other Christians in schools, out at workplaces , on tv shows such as Family Guy, and American Dad, our views on a lot of the political things such as gay marriage which a lot of people persecute us on that view and the list goes on.	Any discriminatory views are persecuted in western society, so being openly homophobic is not really a good idea.	2
Wow! You are going to get some shit for this one....	I already received 2 down-votes and 1 upvote. I know that as a Christian debater I get tons of down-votes and when an non-believer says his thing they get 2+ up votes why cant I get 2+ upvotes. :( Everytime when I debate an atheist someone seems to look at our arguments and they tent to upvote the athiest but not the Christian or when I get an up-vote they down-vote me immediately.	2
"Well i can see were this is going....When most people think geek or nerd they get the image of an unfit person and uncoordinated person. Well some consider me a geek others consider me a nerd. I do not fit in with society at all, my likes/taste and the way i handle things is so very different, but I do not ""fit"" the unfit and uncoordinated stereotype. I was lucky enough to be born with good genetics and amazing reflexes and I do nothing to keep in shape i sit on my ass and on my computer all day (I've watched enough fighting tutorials on the internet to mimic and apply the stuff I've learned). Put me in a fight with the stereotypical nerd or geek and I guarantee you I would win lol.  Point being; there are to many factors that can be applied so this question is just silly."	Of course it's a silly question. It is not meant to have a serious answer. It is just a hypothetical fight between to commonly exaggerated stereotypes.	2
No. Freedom of belief is a right, even for bigots. If we leave room to force religious people to violate their beliefs, it can and will come back on us espescially during the 70th Week of Daniel.	Pakicetus approves of this statement	2
Google Hamas charter and then answer the question. <a href='http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm'>http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm	A real argument ! I'm impressed! Yet, despite what that link says, there are those who deny !	2
After watching some of the show, some of the assumed strange addictions were just unrealistic as if these people are being paid to claim these outrageous acts. Seriously, who would even think about eating chalk.	I used to eat chalk when I was a child. It was the chalk we were writing on the blackboard in class. And so did most of my classmates. Almost every child I knew in my school, at least tasted it because they saw other kids eating it. Some liked the taste some didn't. It was difficult for our parents to convince us to stop, so all the parents were telling their kids that eating chalk would make them sick and get a high fever after eating it. So, some kids were afraid of doctors and injections and they were staying away from it. None of the kids I knew including myself took that habit into adulthood, but it's kinda funny we all did it as kids (in my neighborhood).	2
Music is not just about industry, it's about inspiration. How many musicians are inspired by others to become a musician? How many people enjoy music? The numbers are very large. Music even inspires us to do things we would never do normally. Whether it's entering a talent show or protesting against war, music is one of the most powerful tools we possess. And after having multiple eargasms over Freddie Mercury's 4 octave vocal range, I think it is safe to say we'd be lost without it.	of course yes! music changes entirely person's behaviour! i think if music wasn't existed, we would create it just to save some body's life! music is soft, slow,gentle, suave .as much as it enters your heart it brings all changes you need to be accepted! specially music make seeing tears in rain! lollllll....oxoxxo....for lovers!	2
Ok folks, where do you want the pics to post? If you are speaking of a debate, there is no issue. If you are speaking an argument posted to a debate, I haven't looked at it yet as I have had other priorities for the site... Which one are you speaking of? Thanks, Andy	Being able to embed images within a debate reply would be awesome. There should be limits to the image's size and dimensions, of course - especially dimensions, so people can't screw up the site layout with ridiculously big images.	2
In fact, they're kids, they should only have healthy options and their freedoms be damned. Depending on the grade, I suppose, but at some point these kids are going to be in the adult world and they are going to have to make their own food health decisions so denying them unhealthy but tasty food choices now could have negative unintended consequences later. I say give them the choice now between healthy food and unhealthy food and encourage them (not mandate them) to make intelligent food choices. Give the students both healthy and unhealthy food choices, and allow them to make the choices they will eventually have to make on their own. Prohibiting unhealthy food will only make it appear even more attractive.	Meh, Give the students both crack  and flintstone vitamin choices, and allow them to make the choices they will eventually have to make on their own. Prohibiting crack will only make it appear even more attractive. Perhaps we're referring to different age groups. I'm talking more about grade school level.	2
"Is there someone or something called ""Ghost"" is there? Do you mean ""Ghosts"" or ""a Ghost""? Well, I'll assume you are talking about an individual being ;) I met Ghost a few years back in Antarctica when I was riding the great sea baboon to Outpost A2. It was incredibly cold, so the baboon was constantly pissing on me to keep me warm; the only downside is that he had to do it literally every two seconds (because the piss quickly turned cold, and therefore dangerous). As we arrived at the outpost, a magical flying mushroom crawled out of a whole in the ground and started sniffing the baboon. Aroused, the baboon jumped onto the mushroom and violently raped it until there was mushroom soup all over the ground. Alerted by the commotion outside, a fat, hairy armadillo ran out of the Outpost's main entrance and started yelling at the top of his lungs; something about Arabia, if I remember correctly. This armadillo, was Ghost. So yes, I believe in Ghost :)"	"Is there someone or something called ""Ghost"" is there? There is. He might be talking about any one of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(disambiguation)'>these things."	2
If we all spoke English, or one universal language the war would have been less likely to have taken place. That is the point we are trying to make anyway. In any regards, your argument is also invalid. Even if the war was taking place because of other discrepancies. What's to say they attacking military don't know your language? What's to say the war isn't a civil war? These are factors that'd be eliminated by having war codes, in lieu of actual words.	By having alternate grammar schemes it becomes even harder to decode.	2
since you are a black dude I have to let you know that black people were the first humans to evolve from apes according to the leading theory of evolution. The rest of humanity, other than Inuits, Eskimos, oriental Asian and Red-Indian races, evolved from you apparently	your pretty dumb, modern day whites, africans, asians etc. share a common ancestor with neandertals, and the common ancestor is white, its name is homo heidlbergensis. theres more than one human spieces, incase you didnt know.	2
Lmao! Omg! That is the reason I got so mad when you lied about not downvoting. Because I knew it was you and thought, this guy has balls to think he can lie about... Well I'm drunk but what I mean is it was shifty of you to lie when we knew but all along it was just more ignorance.	._. I didn't lie about not downvoting....I assume you're talking to Jake...x]	2
"I do not think that Puerto Rico should become a state of the United States mostly do to costs. As it is, our economy is doing horribly right now, but that's another argument. Puerto Rico, at the moment, gets food stamps, welfare, voting privileges, and many of the things we, (the US citizens) get, without having to pay taxes. Why buy the cow, when the milk is free? Another change required would be changing our flag. Each star represents a state and each stripe one of the original 13 colonies. This would cost even more money. Lastly, I believe that Puerto Rico and the United States are doing fine how they are, so why try to change things? Although, America does not have an ""official language"" the majority of people speak English. Many Puerto Ricans do not even know English. They have their own cultural traditions and although they are very welcome here, I do not believe we should merge. - Cristal L."	Actually America does have an official language, English. meaning that Puerto Rico would have to make English their primary language also.	2
How do you hide your religion from your children though? Most religions have traditions and rituals that the people partake in.  How do you avoid having to explain why you're doing something like going to church, or praying without your child questioning it? Most likely the best way to deal with avoiding manipulation is tell give them the information of several ways, and don't tell them which one is yours and let them decide. That still leaves the problem I said before. It can take a very long time to choose a faith.	How do you hide your religion from your children though? Most religions have traditions and rituals that the people partake in.  For me personally, as an atheist, that's not an issue. Also, most Christian's I know are not practicing Christians. But yes, I agree, for many people it's not an option. Most likely the best way to deal with avoiding manipulation is tell give them the information of several ways, and don't tell them which one is yours and let them decide. That still leaves the problem I said before. It can take a very long time to choose a faith. Yeah, that's what I'm considering. With other people, I don't really care what they believe as long as they can justify it to themselves, and aren't making such a big decision out of ignorance. But, I would contend that it takes a child a long time to choose a faith. I know I never actively chose a faith, but I was baptized, taken to church by my grandparents, and went to a Church of England School until I was 12, I had 'chosen' to be a Christian very quickly. I hate the idea of parents forcing their ideas onto children, and would like to be as neutral as possible.	2
"Animals were made from dust. If dust means Earth material he made them the same way. ""And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof."" Genesis 2:19 Pretty much Earth material. Animals were made from the water and land, but not formed, the different animals came from ""after their kind"" aka macro-evolution. Lol. No water. God clearly formed them. Isn't it ironic that the word formed is actually there in the verse? I don't think you completely understand the syntax of your bible."	"No....I read the Hebrew and literary technics. Chapter 1 describes the creation process (animals from the land, after life was started in water) and man directly from dust. If God formed every species individually, how were they created ""after their kind""? Rather chapter two is showing the relationship between God animals. Genesis 1 shows that the animals were formed by a natural process, but Genesis 2 shows that doesn't mean God wasn't in control of the process. This is shown when the words ""formed"" G1 and ""formed"" G2 have two different Hebrew words."	2

OK! try to get this now, you said marriage is not a right, and government can not take away, well then how come only few states are allowing same-sex marriage, thats because it's more of a right then anything, that's the government rules over America. People save up for there weddings and stuff, but they don't want to over spend by leaving the country to go get married plus if they come back to the USA then there marriage is not legal. Have you ever heard of people getting married for the benefits? That's because the GOVERNMENT gives them those benefits because they are now a married couple!  and for the adopt thing. I'm talking about gay couple. not a single father or mother. two fathers. and for the whole alcohol and marijuana thing, wtf! those are to different things, so your comparing gays and str8's to beer and drugs... well either way, beer and drugs are one again two different things	Government can revoke your marriage license. For example, in the case of poligamy. What a few states have done is changed their laws to allow gays to get a marriage license so that they can then reap the benefits offered to married couples. When i say people are free to go to another country to get married, I mean that they can go there, get married and stay there. Not come back. Have I heard of people getting married for the benefits? Yes, I have. Two fathers cannot adopt because one of the requirements is that only a man and a woman can adopt. Not two fathers. Not two mothers. Not one man. Not one woman. The whole alcohol, drug thing is not comparing gays to anything. It is comapring one set of laws to another set. Two sets of laws are not two entirely different things. They are a set of laws. These laws are not about rights. They are about priviledges.	2
I clicked it on your name once, and it said you were writing a message to me, but I never got one :( So disappointing	LOL! I've never even started to write a message to you??? I may have just been writing a message to someone else or it was a glitch? You're not one of the people I'm stalking.	2

If you spent less time whining that I'm being unfair and more time solidying your point, as I was allowing you to do, then maybe we'd have something more constructive going.

"I don't know about you, but I don't see the chemical reaction between several atmospheric gases and electricity as a ""higher power"". Just because none of our scientists have managed to perform abiogenesis, does not mean it cannot happen. There are trillions of planets, and abiogenesis took 1.5 billion years to happen on Earth. So you're right, the odds are long. But we can allow those long odds, because even if they are a billion to one, there have been quadrillions of opportunities for life to have been created."	Humans have never yet succeed in making life - a life with consciousness.  (I don't know if they have succeed in making plant life and stuff - do you know? I mean, you can buy seeds in a grocery store - but is it man-made or natural?) But whatever - as I said, life is the one thing scientists have yet to accomplish. Even though there is a possibility that life CAN be made (I doubt this though), I believe that creating life is something really powerful. I mean, I think its interesting to learn about the human body, how it is made - how the universe is made and all the different elementals combining, and making new substances. But what amazes me the most is life itself. The fact that I am present (This is really hard for me to explain :p) That I am aware of everything going around me .. I just think its remarkable. And to think that God made life - I think that is just as crazy, as believing big bang created life.	2

"I'm not interested in doing deep research on this, however, here are a couple I pulled out that sure seem to indicate such a thing That's fine. I wasn't suggesting that you do any deep research though. I was just wondering if you had any idea how the verses you were referring to from Matthew and Mark went. Luke 9:27- But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God When you read it in context with the following verse, it goes like this: ""But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."" I think what that means, is that certain individuals (Peter, John and James in particular), were to receive a glimpse of Heaven before they died. Matthew 24:34- Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. Yeah, this one's a little odd. Some interpret this as the generation being Israel... but in any other spot in the Bible, whenever the term generation is used, it's referring to people of that time period. So, I guess it depends on how you interpret it. Either way, I don't think he was saying that they would live for about 2000 years. It seems to me that he was implying that his second coming would occur within that century."	"Either way, I don't think he was saying that they would live for about 2000 years. It seems to me that he was implying that his second coming would occur within that century. Yeah that is what I got out of it too. And I am aware that the very next line he says that he cannot say when exactly the coming will occur. But that ""generation"" line sure does seem to narrow it down a bit. I do seem to remember a few other lines that could be interpreted that way that bugged me since I was a child, but...perhaps another day."	2
Yes i have i like to help people out although there is a couple cd users that i would never give a ride to because they have no manners (you know who you are)	[Burp] Me?	2

Are you saying that your wedding was NOT all romantic and sappy with symbols of a princes and her knight in shinning armor? Did you get married by the justice of the peace? I'm just asking ;)	"Well I think it was romantic, may have been sappy (I wasn't, I was joyous). No symbols of damsels and knights in shining armor. And we got married by a close friend of ours with a ""small ceremony"" consisting of around 30-40 people. Only close friends and family."	2
Okay, Ismalia I really care about your situation you're in because I found myself in the same position not too long ago when I was a struggling theist. I know it sounds wierd that some random dude on the Internet cares about you but I do, deal with it. So I'm gonna give you the link to a video that really inspired me and kind of cleared my head a bit. It's really inspiring and incredible, I think you'll like it :) now I'm not going to lie to you it is made by an atheist and I'm not pushing anything on you nor will the video, it just sums up the world from a different perspective. Please watch it, it's 10 minutes long but it's very engaging.  Enjoy and tell me what you think :) <a href='http://littleprincessvegan.tumblr.com/post/40344733054/'>http://littleprincessvegan.tumblr.com/post/40344733054/ 	Pfft.

"Well from what I have heard/read they want to make it more one group so then you can cross check and organise better (in theory) instead of having so many different watch groups each having different people in charge. Of course this can be beneficial if information was shared better so that different points of view can also be brought into whatever situation is going on. But pedophiles and the likes of are just one part of my argument, they also want to clean up the less desirable stuff that should be brought and watched at your home, I'm all for normal porn and even some of the more erotic stuff being left alone even though I don't need it because it keeps people happy. But some of the sites I have come across include details in how to capture and rape women or show extensive torture, which to a teenage mind or a slightly coo coo mind might seem like that is what sex is meant to be. Admitting that the need for these ""fantasy"" films and pictures with willing participants is necessary to stop people from living out them but would be better off not available online but needs to be brought."	It seems that would be more a matter of altering indecency laws correct?  You would need to track the makers and make said porn illegal, not track those who watch the porn, if the worry is impressionable youngsters turning into sex-crazed rapists and murderers. I'm a bit vague on precisely where the line should be drawn though. I believe the types of BDSM sites you are speaking of require a credit card which would mean someone over 18. The free porn teens are stuck with don't have the hard core stuff you're referring to, to my extensive knowledge on the subject at least :/	2
Well sometimes people have good information but they aren't on either side.	"You can use the ""clarify"" feature like I just did here and <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Perspectives_Debate_3'>link to a perspectives debate on the same subject if you think it would better be discussed in a format that's not ""for/against""."	2
Some blue collar employment actually requires more skills than white collar employment as a mechanic.	Yeah, I think blue collar workers are nobler because their job is harder. White collar workers could just tell someone to do this or do that, unlike the blue collar wherein they have to do things by themselves. Besides, most of them are paid less.	2
Nah man, he is a sociopath. .	Ok, label him as you will, but either way I don't like him much!	2
Replying to Intangible is pointless. He doesn't make sense most of the time and just spouts off a bunch of glibberty-glock. If he's wrong about something he's too weak too admit it so he just tries to change the subject. It's best to just ignore him as he just feeds on the attention.	I see. I totes agree. I will take in your advice and just give him the cold shoulder. If he even knows what that means.	2

Exactly, I'm saying the group will ultimately make the better decision, based on swam intelligence, which, incidiently, dosent involve individuals being very intelligent. Hmm, yes, we're really not sure how to define 'the economy', but no, the nazi's wern't efficient. A revision of the Nazi heirarchy by, I'm not absolutely sure, but it may have been Rommel, but he may have been dead then, but yeah, it was revised, in 1944 increased productivity by some 30%, which really gives an indication of the waste within nazi ranks. Of course, by that time, it was already too late.	"I can't get past   ""A revision of the Nazi heirarchy...in 1944 increased productivity by some 30%, which really gives an indication of the waste within nazi ranks. Of course, by that time, it was already too late."" I wasn't referring to something as abstract as organizational waste. I was referring to the ruthless efficiency involved in murdering human beings and disposing of their corpses as cheaply and quickly as possible. Generally, that's what people mean when they use ""Nazis"" and ""efficiency"" in the same sentence."	2

"No....I read the Hebrew and literary technics. Chapter 1 describes the creation process (animals from the land, after life was started in water) and man directly from dust. If God formed every species individually, how were they created ""after their kind""? Rather chapter two is showing the relationship between God animals. Genesis 1 shows that the animals were formed by a natural process, but Genesis 2 shows that doesn't mean God wasn't in control of the process. This is shown when the words ""formed"" G1 and ""formed"" G2 have two different Hebrew words."	"Show me the verse that explains that life was made with water. It didn't rain. That is illogical for the creation of life. Also they were formed after Adam and thus your bible throws evolution right out the window. Otherwise you have just revealed a contradiction. The verse I gave cleary said ""out of the ground"". Water is never mentioned. Especially since it didn't rain. Also Cattle was the only one mentioned as their ""kind"". Dude read your bible properly. ""God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."" Did you just find a contradiction? Just like how the Earth came before the sun?"	2
i agree totally because children are addict watching TV more and more and we should decrease the Tv time to safe them . Also watching Tv too much damage eyes and make children ware glass and that bad for them .	Thank YOU for your comment.. I agree with, TV is bad for children, it damage their health. We must keep the children in safety way.	2
I think we should be furthering ourselves from animal behaviour and instincts.	Many people use arguments of evolution describing humans as advanced animals and that the purpose of life is to reproduce. It is quite obvious that there are greater purposes in life than reproduction.  I agree that we should not blindly follow animal instincts. These instincts are often unhelpful though some are helpful. For example a mother's compassion for her children is instinctual and should be valued and developed however the tendency to physically harm those who anger you is not helpful and should be abandoned.	2
You found one of the biggest conservative idiots on YouTube. Good job. Is he an important conservative figure, at all? I truly want to know, because I have no idea who he is.   One person's views do not speak for an entire party.	What about people like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, yes I know Alex is Lib but he's still a conservative Christian extremist? Rush runs the modern day Republican party, yes he does, maybe not by recognition but by default he does, what are your thoughts on people like him and the others I listed?	2
"How would the People's Republic of China accomplish such a thing, when the United States of America maintains naval and air superiority?

"How can you believe the universe had to have had a beginning, but that God can be immortal and had no beginning? Atheists don't ""believe"" the universe started with the big bang, it's just the best theory anyone has come up with so far. The key difference between religion and science is that, if a scientist doesn't know something, he admits it, and then maybe tries to figure out an experiment to find out. If a religious person doesn't know something, he makes something up, and then defends to the death his right to believe it, and to make others believe it too."	A higher power is something that obviously is higher than you. More powerful than you. And a higher power is what created YOU, and what created LIFE. God is my higher power - he is what created ME and what I believe created LIFE. If big bang is what created life.. then it must be your higher power right? If big bang is your higher power, then big bang is a God - and atheism is officially a religion.	2
Well, if something were to happen that would prevent the U.S. from waging war (like..., the U.S. going bankrupt, for example) then they may go for it. I think that it is a possibility that we will go bankrupt if we keep on printing money and bailing companies out.	This could be a possibility, we have to stop bailing out companies. But the US would not be prevented from waging war. If you have weapons you need not purchase them =]	2
Are you saying you built your own PS3? If so, where did you get the O/S?	no... I said I have the parts to mod my PC. I just need a bigger tower.	2
It's sad but it's kind of true. Once I graduated highschool, My friends and I parted ways. I remain in contact with only about three people from my highschool years. That's how life is.  Facebook seemed like a highschool thing to me. Hell, the only reason I made it in the first place was to get with a girl I went to school with!	yeah isn't easy to keep in touch :/	2
Of course your right and I would agree totally with you ,I found it an interesting question	What would you do then?  You're told to either shoot 5 people your self and save 10 others, or save those five people and allow someone else to shoot 10 people as you watch.	2
Man, we are so going to have sea colonies before we have space colonies. The sea is where it's at.	The ocean has so much potential, as does space, but developing the ocean for human use (i.e. farming, living, transport) would cost countless trillions of dollars less than developing and running even the simplest space colony.	2

EVERYONE DOES THINK THAT THEY ARE RIGHT.. AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN A GROUP, THEY TEND TO INSIST THEIR VIEW.. AND WITH THAT, WHAT WOULD YOU CAME UP WITH?... IT'S BETTER TO CARRY IT SINGLEHANDEDLY THEN REVISE IF NEEDED BY CHECKING OTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME SORT...	"The method of ""aggregation"" matters. You are implying an aggregation based on consensus- everyone goes into a room and talks it through until they reach something everyone can agree to. That is not the only possibility however.  Voting, particularly anonymous voting distances the decision from the sway of group dynamics and permits individuality while still creating a group decision. Stock markets work the same way."	2
The iPhone is definitely a must have these days. The features on the phone are unbelievable, and surfing the Internet is so much better than those POS CrackBerries. You can stream videos directly from YouTube, use Google Maps when you get yourself lost, check stocks on the go, etc. It's years ahead of the other phones available and is the best product out there by far. Now if only you could use it with a service other than AT&T.	The iPhone is far and away better than the competition. My phone bill is the same as it was before with Verizon, yet my iPhone comes with internet service. After your first test drive with the iPhone, it is east to see that this is the only phone that doesn't cut corners with its browser application. I would like to see CreateDebate customize a site made specifically for all of the iPhone owners out there.	2
Maybe because it was, however that is up for us to decide. The government withholding information from us can only be justified through Machiavellian logic, and at that point the government is admitting that it is an authoritarian regime.	Machiavellian logic  I had to search that one. Nice contribution, I love to learn something new, and it gives me some ideas for new debates.	2
Meh? I liked shooting the chickens.	Lol ya, its just a game to jump into whenever you have some spare time, its supposed to be like an arcade shooter, which is badass	2
What is really true does not change with the wind IMO. Opinions may change but truth usually does not. The only non-example of this is scientific truth, which is almost always evolving. Unfortunately, when issues of science are politicized, the first thing that usually gets through out the window is the truth, and I say that as a scientist myself.	I know. I can't believe this global warming crap. Unbelieveable ;)	2
Jesus told them they didn't have to cut part of their dick off. That is a very powerful force.	-- really? Its done at a young age and makes it easier to clean.	2
Soil it's self does not turn in to trees... Are you sure about that? 	"Yep :) You need the seedling first, and this takes nutrients from the soil. But soil cannot produce this on it's own. Trees die, decompose, and this is soil. Trees on their own can turn to soil. Soil on it's own cannot turn to trees. If you think otherwise, please state why, instead of just asking if "" I'm sure"" or not.."	2
"Outside of the divine creation of man, does or does not the Bible line up with the big bang and evolution? It does not. The book of Genesis doesn't line up with the Big Bang Theory or the Theory of Evolution. Earth did not exist before the sun, and the vast majority, if not all organic life on Earth has a common ancestor, they were not created according to their ""kinds""."	"Earth has a common ancestor, they were not created according to their ""kinds"" The Hebrew translates into ""by means of the succeeding species"". Any person whom studies evolution knows that the connecting generations (1 &2;, 2&3;,........100&101;) are the same species. That is following the Bible. It is the (1......101) that are not in the same species. However god says the different animals came about by staying in the same species, but changed my means of the species in succeeding species. Aka evolution. Earth did exist before the sun Already covered! The only mention of the sun is in relation to the earth for light when the clouds cleared, not creation of the sun. Look at any study Bible and you will see this is declarative, not active creation. _"	2
That reminds me of Daybreakers. I'm quite certain that the vamipres didn't age. A little girl committed suicide, probably after having spent so many years in the same body.	How is Daybreakers? Is it good? Worth it or not. ( .. )	2
"sorry whats ""Mother""? The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible."	Lol , its one of those energy drinks. I assume you dont have them where you live. :)	2
Corect me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Helen Keller dumb. She couldn't talk correctly at least, and she could figure out that weird hand thing she did. That doesn't seem very stupid to me.	This is why 'dumb' is an archaic word to describe people who are mute. Originally, it was thought that mute people were simply too 'dumb' to learn to speak, hence the propagation of the term. Much like people do not call mentally handicapped people 'retarded', people do not call mute people 'dumb'.	2
Some are more honest than others... I still don't trust them though.	Well... I never said I was going to trust John McCain or any of them to feed my cat while I'm on vacation a thousand miles away in Florida.	2

you know what i mean. -_- and wow. i mean. i'm not really sure to what i should feel about your surgeries and bathroom trips. :/	How could I know what you mean. I mean I'm pretty mean, but people usually deserve my aggression, of you know what I mean.  As to what you should feel about my surgery; I'd say the scar. It's a little bit rough, a little bit smooth; its a nice mix of textures. As to what you should feel about my bathroom trips; I'd have to say the force and temperature of the stream.  Speaking of streams, I've heard that salmon swim up-stream; I've tried pointing my stream up, turns out its not a good idea. It is very similar to tugging on superman's cape, or pulling the mask off the Lone Ranger, or messing around with Jim.	2
Oh really? I was under the impression you only went one way...	Well you can only go one way. How are you going to go two ways or more, at once?	2
I agree with the premise of the debate but need some clarification on how we don't mate naturally.I mean biologically it seems pretty natural to me, were not using virtualy reality devices, and growing babies in test tubes just yet.  As for being the most highly evolved, this is common misconception about evolution. Evolution doesn't imply complexity, some the most evolved organisms on this planet are also some of the most simple in structure, biologically complex machines don't tend to do as well in the harshest environments e.g. thermophilic bacteria  Complex organism's can evolve into simpler organisms. As for going against nature, we have separated ourselves as a species from the natural world, and think that because we have ego's (which are an illusion) we are above it.We think we are civilised, and thus separate from anture, but this is illusory. The more we destroy the ecosystem which gave birth to our species the more we hasten our own destruction.	I meant how we choose our mates. Before there would be survival purposes to choosing a partner, now there's none of that almost.  And you're correct about the most evolved.	2
A large group of informed people will have better judgment than an equally informed individual. That said, the masses tend not to be very well informed (although the internet is helping to change that).	mmm, no, not necessarily. Refer to swarm intelligence (again) <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence  The masses dont really need to be that intelligent to do intelligent things, although things do tend to be more intelligent the more intelligent the mass, the correspondence is not neccessarily linear.	2
not really, i am just about to reach the 1000 day mark and it feels like the time just flew by.	Everyone says that when they retire. 	2
I am posting proof here. Click on the link. :(	I'm neither supporting or disputing this. I just don't think there's enough information available. He was no Christian, that much is for sure. He sounds like an atheist; but even then that's not entirely clear either and I don't want to append that label to him with such scant evidence. So...I'm on the fence with this one.	2
All of the above. 	"How often? Really? Because unless you're doing them all the time, there are a million people who need real, tangible ""Christian"" help, rather than the few people on this website who have no interest in being converted to a religion, of which we have seen so many negative effects. ""Love thy neighbor as yourself"". Spend a little more time loving and a little less time telling people they will be going to hell, which for the record, may not even be real."	2
First of all, i'm not saying PS3 is better. I believe both consoles are great seeing as i've had both. They both have their ups and downs, and it's pointless to argue which is better. Another thing is, most people who DO argue about these kinds of things, are usually fan-boys/girls who only think one is better then the other because they've grown up with that console and come to love that consol and only know about that console. Reading some of the arguments on this page, i've learnt some people don't actually no what they're talking about.  A lot of my friends have PS3s, and a lot of my friends have XBoxes. The ones with PS3s say that PS3 is better and the ones with XBoxes say the XBox is better. But the thing is, they only HAD one console or the other. My brother has an XBox and a PS3 for some odd reason and he even stayed with me for a while with both. I played both and they're both great. I don't see a big difference between the two. If you argue whether or not the PC is better than the PS3/Xbox, i'd gladly argue that case.	I will say now I prefer the Xbox 360 (As you know xD) but you make some really good points there. I do prefer the Xbox now because I've had it for most of the time I've been a gamer. There are so many games on there I like, but that's because I've lived with them instead of PS3 games. I did have a PS2, and I loved some of the games on that, especially the Final Fantasy series, and it's such a shame they make them mostly for Playstation. The only one they made for both was rubbish in my opinion. I have played games on a PS3 before, and thought some were alright, but never got a proper chance to play, so I can't really comment on how good they are.	2
I was thinking that for something to be logically considered a medicine it should necessarily aid in the healing from or prevention of an illness or at least be intended to. There are disorders related to menstruation, like endometriosis, which can cause abnormally severe pain. Birth control is a method of treating endometriosis, and some women take the pill specifically for that reason. So birth control is a medicinal treatment for endometriosis. <a href='http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/endometriosis.cfm#j'>http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/endometriosis.cfm#j PMS and PMDD are hormone imbalances that can be corrected with birth control. There is some evidence that birth control may even alleviate depression. So birth control is a medicinal treatment for mood disorders. <a href='http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/new-no-period-no-pms-birth-control-pills'>http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/new-no-period-no-pms-birth-control-pills                                        Birth control can also be taken to deal with acne, and some people take it specifically for that, too. So birth control is also a medicinal treatment for acne.  <a href='http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-control-pills-for-acne/AN02016'>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-control-pills-for-acne/AN02016  Not everybody takes birth control as a method of correcting disorders, but lots of people do. It has other effects besides suppressing menstruation and preventing pregnancy, and any deliberate use of those effects to correct medical conditions can be considered medicinal use by your own definition.  Watch how the affirmative side remains absent of thoughtful argument.  Being condescending is not a good way to kick off a debate.	Being condescending is not a good way to kick off a debate. I got what I wanted. Thank you very much.

"No....I read the Hebrew and literary technics. Chapter 1 describes the creation process (animals from the land, after life was started in water) and man directly from dust. If God formed every species individually, how were they created ""after their kind""? Rather chapter two is showing the relationship between God animals. Genesis 1 shows that the animals were formed by a natural process, but Genesis 2 shows that doesn't mean God wasn't in control of the process. This is shown when the words ""formed"" G1 and ""formed"" G2 have two different Hebrew words."	"Show me the verse that explains that life was made with water. It didn't rain. That is illogical for the creation of life. Also they were formed after Adam and thus your bible throws evolution right out the window. Otherwise you have just revealed a contradiction. The verse I gave cleary said ""out of the ground"". Water is never mentioned. Especially since it didn't rain. Also Cattle was the only one mentioned as their ""kind"". Dude read your bible properly.  ""*God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

Freedom to express their opinions, not freedom to post pictures of other people	You're mistaken. I posted more on the other column... but there are many cases to do with the printing pictures of people and this is included in the freedom of expression.  It could be that in Denmark it is illegal to take a picture of someone in the street with their permission. I don't know. The actually taking of the picture isn't to do with freedom of expression - just the printing of it.	2
Look at me dead in the face and tell me you wouldn't prefer dragging your balls through STD infested broken glass versus watching My Little Pony.	"Yeah, can't really look you in the face over the Internet; but I would not, in fact, prefer dragging my balls through STD infested broken glass (don't know how glass contracts a disease, I'd have gone with ""STD coated glass"") to watching a cartoon.  Watching My Little Pony would be rather annoying; but (and I can only imagine) potentially contracting a sexually transmitted disease through shredded scrotum skin has got to be more annoying."	2
Darwin was wrong then, he is now, and he will continue to be dead wrong about evolution. In fifty years, Darwinism will be completely refuted and science will finally move on...	I would disagree... 68% of people aged 18-25 were atheist/agnostic because of the overwhelming hegemony of the evolutionary community.	2

Guns don't kill people because a gun's energy is potential. It becomes kenetic once someone pulls the trigger, therefor 'people kill people'. As for toasters... It goes through the same concept, it can't do anything unless we initiate it.	I know. Your right. No kidding. And did you know that a water bottle also ACTUALLY WON'T OPEN until SOMEONE SCREWS the top off?! It's absolutely amazing! How about the fact that the lead character in a video game actually WON'T MOVE UNTIL THE PLAYER USES THE CONTROLLER?! WHAT KIND OF INSANE ARGUMENT IS THIS?! IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED AN EDUCATED ANSWER!!!	2
That article is hysterical. And I thought he was some super do good, never killed anyone, type of guy.	He was that super do good never killed anyone guy for a while but that was thanks to the comics code which I think came in, in the 60's and was still around in this century although it has been ignored for a long time it wasn't totally abandoned until 2010 I think and the TV series pretty much cemented his boy scout image.	2
I think I love you, Joe!! LOL .	Well..., just go with it. Don't over analyze it too much ;)	2

He isn't a monk, he's just an oldfashioned hopeless romantic, who likes everything the old way. He did seem a little mushy about the whole Lizzie and him being a couple ( I know she turned out to be fake, but his feelings weren't fake, and that proves he wants love)	Well not anymore I am not because I have other things to focus on and such.

I was going to post 2 pictures of the women I would like to see sumo wrestle but then I decided that it's not my job to contribute to the delinquency of minors by downloading porn for them.

Our treatment of other races as second class citizens has been done away with for some time now. Affirmative action is ridiculous in my opinion. Any label a minority may have for not being fit for the professional world they have placed on themselves and I refuse to believe they need any special help.	affirmative action is not needed. Second class citizens based on race are gone and have been for long enough to actually base action on criteria.	2

Though I'm pretty sure since there aren't tits on this site it'll weed out the idiots if I did post it XD	2
The study where you got this morality test from (don't know how much it's been forwarded via emails and shit) found that Libertarians were far more likely to push the fat man than Liberals or Conservatives. Same studies showed that Liberals were the worst at knowing what people holding opposite views actually believed in. just thought the world should no :3	Very interesting... Does it show any connection to libertarianism to that choice in the morality test?	2

I picked English because it was the best of the 2 choices given but you really ought to consider Spanish. It is spoken in Spain, the central American countries, South American countries, and many of the islands in the Atlantic and Pacific. And once the illegals take over the U.S...... ;)	Yea illegals will never take over the U.S......;) but they are like cockroaches hahaha Oh and yea English most definate!	2
The violence in the movies are more violent and sexual tan they have to be. As the movie popularity of these days are increasing they are best tracked along by the violence. Either the hero ends with Villain or villain ends up with the hero... But only a few movies are concerned with the present day sexuality.. if these are decreased, the wrong views and stupid understandings will disappear	In a formal debating contest, there are rules for people to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will interact.	2
No, people shouldn't be locked up for their political views. You are mixing political freedom with economic freedom. But it is unfair for their political views to infringe on my economic view because you want more government in economics. I am all for social freedoms. I am all for the separation of church and state. Matter of fact, religion is scam. Freedom of speech shouldn't be restricted and people may assemble with they please and anyone has the right to own a gun.	I knew you'd get hell to pay for that one - I was actually surprised that anybody agreed.	2
Well... you're what? 17? Intangible claims to be in his 30s? I dunno because he changes his shit all the time so who knows how old he really is? He acts like he's about 12..	I'll be 17 in 10 days. Didn't Intangible post his real life picture as his profile pic before?	2

"This is a stupid question. Is this how one accumulates points on here...by coming up with stupid questions to start a ""debate""?"	Lol.

 to convey information. Give me an example of when you are fully capable of saying this without offending someone.

"You are dead wrong! It most certainly is not legal to kill someone simply because they broke into your home or anywhere else unless that person has a gun or other type of firearm! An old man coming at you with a cane, albeit a break in, does not constitute a reason to kill and you will be counting your jelly beans in prison for a very long time. Even if he came at you with a medieval spiked mace, it is your obligation to try and escape his thrusts unless no other means was available to you...and even then, logic tells me that escape is not that difficult. The rules and laws pertaining to self defense have either escaped you or you really didn't know what they were to begin with.  You seem to have a love affair with the word ""incognizant."" Over 50% of the time, you use the word improperly. Please look it up and use it in the context it should be used. Your argument on self defense indicates you are incognizant of its true meaning."	Actualy you can in some states I think.	2
So, did they explain it to you? If not, I'll be happy to guide you through it. lol	Some things they have had to explain to me, I wouldn't want to be guided through it...EWWWW. I will not say what they have told me that I have had to ask what it meant!!!	2
Please check your message box. I just sent a message to you. As humans, we mustn't indulge in debates which will bring conflict. Let's live in peace. Please check the message.

Holy shit! I didn't even know you liked plague inc. That games awesome! Infact i used it in an example in one of your debates ^_^ and seen this later. Also, Scientists have been genetically engineering viruses for a long time now. If they really wanted too (or due to some accident reminiscent of the Resident Evil games {I.E global catastrophe due to a bio hazard outbreak}) they could kill us all no problem and a select few in government or rich people would maybe beable to survive it... maybe.	I love the game. I am awesome at it. I got America to nuke china and russia before.	2
Power corrupts.	And absolute power corrupts absolutely! There remains a well populated list of countries that are ruled by Monarchy and a few are still absolute Monarchies. Some are governed by Monarch but with constitutions which disallow full authority by the Monarch. In Great Britain, the Monarchy is but a figurehead of a nation ruled by Parliamentary (Constitutional) law. The URL listed below gives us information on how each Monarchy is actually governed. Can they be a good form of government? Yes, they can if the throne is held by a reasonable Monarch! In tribal nations, however, absolute Monarchies can be , have been and still are the ruination of its people in every way imaginable.	2
Not really because I was a baby who wasn't potty trained.	Okay?  	2
"I don't know what you're talking about, considering that there isn't a possible way for us to be anything BUT natural. Now, if by natural you mean untouched by human hands... than simply grabbing a fruit makes it unnatural. If by unnatural you mean changing the genealogy of a food product in order to make it grow in different conditions, you simply are not very familiar with genetics.  To suggest that their is a ""natural"" order is merely elitism by noninterference. Genes don't have any ""rules"" that they must abide by (or else we're heading for disaster). Genes and DNA are simply how things come to be. Cross breeding is advantageous for it helps weed out any weak life that may not be able to cope with its environment. The Black Plague resulted in the breeding of humans with a much better genetic code. With the age of micro-technology and medicine, we've simply figured out how to use genetics to make everything far more advantageous than before. We've developed medicine to combat diseases that our body structure was never meant to fight. We've traded anemia for asthma (look up Hook Worms). How do we deal with asthma? With medication (just how some even deal with anemia with medication). Is this ""unnatural"" just because if it were up to nature, a lot more of us would still be dying in our 50s? If that's the case, I don't even see the benefit behind keeping things ""natural"".  As for mating, what, we use condoms and contraceptives? As a person who enjoys sex but has no intention in getting either an STD or a baby, I am very grateful for my ""unnatural"" advantage towards sex. Once again, I don't see how ""natural"" is making things better. This concept that somehow things ""need"" to be ""natural"" is sort of just based on a belief in a divinity of the Universe itself. That for some reason, us humans aren't allowed to use our minds to our own advantage. If we have the ability to create such wonderful things like medicine, GMOs, condoms, etc, what gives others the authority to say that it's ""wrong"" or ""unnatural"". Surely if it were unnatural we wouldn't be able to do it in the first place (considering that everything in the physical realm comes from nature). But hey, people tend to be against progress."	I don't think you're wrong in anything you said but there is a different way to interpret this and I wondered what you might think about that. For example, take someone who is repressing homosexual urges because they are afraid God will send them to hell. On one hand, it's natural to want to have sex with the same gender. On the other hand, it's also natural to edit behavior to avoid perceived divine punishment. So neither of the urges are unnatural but the former is older than the latter, and widespread in the rest of the animal world.  Another illustration is the tendency of people to want to eat a lot of fat and sugar. It's natural to want to eat that whenever it's available, because in the past it was rare. Now, it isn't, and it's also natural for people to think 'too much of this could kill me, I should maybe stop.' We don't really see other animals going on purposeful diets unless they're sick, but I think all of them would gorge themselves to obesity if they could. Neither of these newer tendencies is unnatural to people in the sense that it's impossible or artificially created. But they're both possible because of human intelligence which is relatively new and absent in the rest of nature. Also, they both conflict with older instincts that are common in the rest of nature. So when people are caught between two impulses, one of which has deeper roots in our evolution, and the other of which might be only present in humans, is it always bad to deny the old one?	2

Documentaries. When do police draw their weapon? Are there any laws governing this?	I'd like to know this too. Where I work, a cop shot a Costco employee five times after she complained loudly about the number of slices in a pizza. She may have approached him with her pizza knife, and he did try a taser first.	2
George Carlin stands out the most to me .	I've heard C.K. is influenced a lot by Carlin. I've heard about him being one of the greats of all time in comedy, but I haven't listened to any of his stuff, yet. What would you say is his best?	2
"The wording (you're style of writing) and the topics, generally. And the time at which the debate was made. This one, for example, after a flurry of activity on an abortion debate we are presented with this debate that is essentially your take on the issue. You also oftentimes try to find middle ground, or compromise, or mediate, so words like ""that we can all live by"" in your debates give it away. Also debates that have some element of sarcasm, humor, or trolling in the title, (i.e. Gravity Sucks. It keeps bringing me down) are usually yours."	So..., trying to find a middle ground/compromise/mediate gives me away. OK..., So..., should I be a bigger ass hole than I already am in order to hide my identity until people actually click the debate and see my smiling dog ;) I'm not open to giving up sarcasm ;)	2
Why wouldn't it be? Of course the answer is yes, but that position is so obvious that it becomes unintresting to even discuss. Why Africa today is a place of so much poverty and misery and how the region could begin to lift itself up, is a much more intresting subject to discuss.  How then, could that happen? and why does poverty seem to have such a grip on the continent?	Probably these people who say never are racist. Let's help the Africans. Make them live like mankind deserves. Give 15% of the taxes to the poor. Help Africa. DEFEND IT FROM THE RACIST !	2
One cannot dig a hole to Hell. One can only dig a hole to China.	Well... I've been saying this for years but no one will listen.	2

I remember the times when people wouldn't talk about that shit on television... oh well. Whatever floats our boat of prosperity.	2
You can't be serious right? This is crazy. Do Nazis still exist ?	Neo Nazis and Skinheads. The gangs (usually in prison) that are comprised of white, similar looking people, all covered in tattoos, all bald. That's what I mean, I don't think a political organization of them could still exist, what with most governments trying to propose world peace.	2
If changes to materials are made without consideration to how they're being used in classroom teaching, the very purpose of changing the materials would be defeated. The purpose of making changes to materials is to adapt the it to the learner's interest, ability, and at times, to the limitations of the classroom. Ultimately, it is to provide students with the appropriate material that could bring forth maximum productivity. Without considering the usage of the materials in the classroom, any changes made to the materials would be pointless as they would not cater to the needs of the students, and thus not lead to a better understanding and learning. Therefore, i concur that changes made to materials must consider how they're used in classroom teaching. A misapplication or suitability could not only hinder students' learning but also possibly confuse them further.	I agree with amantha, in that if changes are made to materials (meant to adapt into different lessons, no?)... it's basically for the sake of suiting different classroom teachings. To ensure that learning takes place in the classroom. It does not make sense to NOT consider how materials are used in classroom teaching if it were to be adapted. Factors that contribute to material adaptation would include: different class profiles, teacher's style, learner's abilities, and also different lesson objectives as calvin mentioned. Materials are therefore used differently according to the differences of the factors listed above.	2
because it adds to the overall debate/argument score counts, and I'm not going to spend my time replying to asinine shit. Vote down and move on.	That is true.

I'm guessing a white wedding dress is typical which is gay? lol Mine was mostly white and silver with black trimming.

"My Buddhist studies are about a good year or two behind me now, but my recollection is that the higher state (not sure ""higher"" is even the word I should have used but that's the gist) is one of transcendence from being an individual self to being a collective which exists on a different plane away from suffering. In a sense, sort of a Buddhist collectivist heaven if that helps to think of it."	OK, thanks. I just don't want to make that mistake again, thanks once again.	2

Too early? Ha! The only thing that made him seem better than marginal last year was the receivers making him look better than he was. If you watch any amount of film you'll see he was just throwing the ball up most of the time and the receivers we going up to get the ball.<br />I'm glad he went out with the whimper of a playoff loss.	"I agree with derecola. Favre was lucky last year to have a great receiving core that saved his butt on many occasions. His gunslinger approach used to work well for him when he was more accurate, but now that he just throws the ball up for grabs it doesn't work quite as well. He should have retired a while ago, and frankly I'm glad that we don't have to hear anymore of this ""I think I'm going to retire"" stuff from him and going back and forth on whether or not to call it quits, doing interviews on 60 Minutes, SportsCenter, etc. He's worse than Roger Clemens in that respect (at least he didn't get caught taking steroids though)."	2

No. Go back 6 million years ago, when the first humans emerged with Chimps. Did,they believe in God,No!! But a few million years later we do?? Isn't that weird.  Piaf God is so real, why did he allow the Holocuast. The genocide if innocent millions.	"No. Go back 6 million years ago, when the first humans emerged with Chimps. Did,they believe in God,No!! But a few million years later we do?? Isn't that weird. The oldest known remains for the species Homo sapiens is only 200,000 years old, and the overall genus Homo is roughly 2.5 million years old. That inaccuracy aside, ""[a]rchaeological evidence suggests that religious beliefs have existed since the first human communities"" (<a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion'>Merriam-Webster Concise Encyclopdia). Moreover, deconstructing religious iterations of God does not inherently defeat the possibility of the abstract god.  Piaf God is so real, why did he allow the Holocuast. The genocide if innocent millions. This assumes a lot of attributes about god - involvement, investment, benevolence, compassion - which do not necessarily have to be true for god to exist. To be entirely clear, I verily disbelieve in the existence of both God and god. I merely think you advance a poor argument in defense of that stance."	2
So superman can just dumpster dive and starting giving a beatdown to Captain Planet? He could pick up some toxic waste and just lay waste to Captain Planet? What about air pollution? What if the fought in China? He would surely lose.	Captain Planet would merely need Kryptonite to subdue Superman. Why would Captain Planet show up to a fight in a polluted area?	2
"You are dead wrong! It most certainly is not legal to kill someone simply because they broke into your home or anywhere else unless that person has a gun or other type of firearm! An old man coming at you with a cane, albeit a break in, does not constitute a reason to kill and you will be counting your jelly beans in prison for a very long time. Even if he came at you with a medieval spiked mace, it is your obligation to try and escape his thrusts unless no other means was available to you...and even then, logic tells me that escape is not that difficult. The rules and laws pertaining to self defense have either escaped you or you really didn't know what they were to begin with.  You seem to have a love affair with the word ""incognizant."" Over 50% of the time, you use the word improperly. Please look it up and use it in the context it should be used. Your argument on self defense indicates you are incognizant of its true meaning."	You are dead wrong. Only read your first 3 sentences and you are about as right as izquierda <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/us/07shoot.html'>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/us/07shoot.html  YOU SEEM TO BE INCOGNIZANT which would pertain to your LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. read this little piece of information that came out a couple YEARS ago.  The Florida law, which served as a model for the others, gives people the right to use deadly force against intruders entering their homes. They no longer need to prove that they feared for their safety, only that the person they killed had intruded unlawfully and forcefully. The law also extends this principle to vehicles. which means I can shoot you kuklapolitan if you are inside of my house without my consent. so judging by your second sentence WRONG. The person breaking into my house could be holding a damn coke a cola and I have the right to shoot and kill him. Thanks for playing Kuklapolitan. This law applies to more than just Florida.	2

Most people meditate to calm themselves from worldly problem but not monks. Some (and some non-monks) meditate for spiritual enlightenment by achieving nirvana or eternal peace as achieved by Buddha. Most consider him an exception with unspeakable talent beyond normal grounds. Not mystical? My friend, mysticism is a field yet to be validated. Consider 'silly'. Shaolin monks trained on meditation as much as the art of fighting. Using trained inner energy their punch could reach three fold the amount of a human with their same muscle mass. If science (dominated by the west) could spend more time on it then it would be such a big deal since we are not just made up of a sack of meat.	"I'd like to argue the misconception of the buddha, no way did the buddha elevate himself or say that what he did was mystical. He did not say ""hey look, I suddenly understood the world just out of thin air"". If one reads his life, and also a book called ""The Lotus Sutra"", it defines that the buddha came to conclusions based on constant observations, trial and errors, this is why he came across various religious teachings to ""Seek the truth and understanding"" until he realized that the answer is within and not outside of oneself. This is stance he took against the argument of an existence of an abstract force that influences the material world.  Even if we were to agree that the buddha ""mystically"" understood the world, then it would be contradictory to the question of this argument, as the buddha did not advocate the belief of a god, he advocated the belief that every human being had the power within him or herself to be just as equal to the buddha. Therefore, it would still be contradictory to use him or his ""mysticism"" to advance the argument that god or a creator exist because then it would say that mankind contains the same ""mystical"" powers as god does, which in conclusion would mean god is irrelevant"	2

"Truly! Sad is the day wherein such words are self-evidently true, i.e., ""We have all of the power. We're just too stupid and lazy to use it.""!"	That's because Americans are civilized. And by civilized, I mean that the willingness to fight is reduced by the benefits of the society. While civilization gives birth to internal stability, it also breeds a kind of tragic complacency that often results in the members of the civilization to remain complicit in their own abuse. The whole notion is like: it's better to be here than live in a temporary Liberia (a little extreme, but you get the point).	2
Titanic The Movie is basically a piece of history! Where as to Avatar, it's a fictional story based on nothing! All that Avatar shows are signs that the people who wrote are living in a fantasy world!	This plot to Avatar is ridiculously similar to that of Disney's Pochahantus, which was based on the English colonization of North America and how the Natie Americans where treated.	2

Even if she hates me, and even if I hated her back (I don't), but even if I did, I'd still have to respect her because she's not just some complacent fool who accepts what they're told.	Damn!

Are you afraid to give me your opinion just in case you say something stupid? Ive seen all the arguments, you article presents no new information, and proves absolutely nothing, there is scientific concensus on global warming.	2
First of all, straight people don't get a pass when it comes to adoption. There are certain requirements that must be met. Those requirements apply to gays as well. Again, gays can marry anyone they want, anywhere they want, whenever they want (as long as it is someone of the opposite sex). If certain religions don't accept gays, gays are free to start their own religion. If there are other countries that allow same sex marriages, then gays are free to go live there. This isn't communist China.	Is that common sense I hear!? Wow haven't heard it in a while. It's nice isn't it? (;	2
"There will always be wind so long as the earth rotates, however streams and rivers are never consistant and some even dry up or the water level drops or rises to extreme conditions. So wind power is easier to predict where to get it and one can always find areas of extreme ""windy-ness"" to harness its power."	Wind power is my favorite alternative energy generation technique, because it could be used by individual people to generate power, and scaled up to power cities. It's very versatile. The reasons that people use to try and keep wind turbines from their area are very annoying, though. They say that the speed of the rotors causes noise pollution. They say that the large turbines ruin their views, and that they could cause problems with the migration of birds. Surely these are the same people that complain about the price of energy and want a cheap solution. It is windy about 99% of the time in the area that I live in, and up in the mountains and on Fire Island, the wind is always blowing. It's a great opportunity that many people are missing out on for very insignificant reasons.	2
It is a war. Only congress can declare war. Period. The last war declared by Congress was WWII The Iraq and Afghanistan Wars was not a declaration of war, but a military engagements authorized by Congress. There is a difference. Bush however did a mighty fine job convincing Congress to authorize.	I agree with that. *I needed 50 characters to post this comment or it won't show.	2
I wouldn't go as far as saying their evil but their definitely immoral, covering up the Paedophile Priest thing and members of the church living in wealth whilst their followers live in poverty, its no coincidence that in the old days the second son of a king always entered the church (it was where the money and largest power base after the king was). This latest pope seems to know a bit more about how the real world works being more accepting towards gays etc, so hopefully this could be a new age of acceptance for them. You changed the title so iv'e changed sides!! As I said not evil but immoral	Good point	2

"Hmm, at the time you told me you didn't know who he was and you knew little about philosophy. But now you say you don't like him because of his theories..

Like refusing to eat a certain food, because "" you don't like it"" yet haven't tried it. I don't like him now after talking to you about him in that debate. I didn't have an opinion on him and you attacked me. And you told me no one cares about what I said, hence the meanness. And just to add to that, I made a nice long debate for you all to complain to me about on how I am wrong and it makes no sense, e.t.c. I didn't say no one cares about what you think until after you viewed me as dribbling from the mouth. I do love the attention really :) Damn it."	Think you'll find you did say that nor you nor anyone else cared about my opinions, before I said.. Whatever I've forgotten now anyway. So Ja...	2
Good theory. Do you think that the groupthink psychological dynamic be contained or mitigated at least?	I think simply understanding it goes a long way toward mitigating its effects.	2
Is there a such thing as an honest politician? Honest Abe was probably the last one and none of us were even alive back then, so who knows... he may have been a liar too.  Since I don't think honesty is a trait of any politician, I can't say that it's something I look for considering it's probably impossible to find. But every now and then comes a politician who can get the job done, it's rare but it does happen. So, I'd have to say that out of those two options, it would have to be this one... because I'm pretty sure that it is the only one out of the two, that exists among politicians.	Actually I think a few of them are honest... John McCain is pretty honest IMHO... AND he's hated by... well pretty much everyone, left and right. He's Republican but most really partisan GOP people hate him because sometimes he compromises... he doesn't just spout off GOP talking points. I can respect that even if I don't agree with the person most of the time.	2
I validate your concern. I call myself a skeptical theist. My attitude when people tell me to have faith: give me a reason. When they give me a reason: prove it. When they cannot prove it: leave me alone. i guess my point is that I understand. Now for my question: what is the basis for what you believe? What lead you to each conclusion?	I don't believe in any gods because like you said there's nobody who can prove they exist. There's no evidence to support any supernatural things so therfore the only logical conclusion is to not accept them. Thus I am not convinced	2

they lost their meaning a long time ago. Nearly all festivals are based on earlier ones. Christmas for instance. Christmas is not the date Jesus' birth Rather it is the date chosen to represent it. Christmas originally was the Birth-date of the Pagan God Sol Invictus (Roman god) the Christians chose this date because a) it was already a festival and therefore easy to do and b) to show once and for all that they had replaced the old ways with their own. The current festivals are heading the same way, they are losing their own meaning as more and more as people are either atheist or there is a greater mixture of religions present in society. It is inevitable that one day the dates of these festivals will be used or a date near them will be used to some other holiday of some sort. The way things are going these festivals will revolve around consumption (reminds me of BRAVE NEW WORLD) and the giving of gifts that have been bought. Is this a bad thing? maybe not, so long as people do not need to buy things that cause them to live beyond their means. Perhaps the festivals will not revolve around consumption but looking at Easter and Christmas it certainly seems this is the likely outcome of current trends. P.S. most of us have the day off for holidays/festivals so if our society feels the need to consumption/giving based festivals can we create new ones on different dates so we get more days off?	Very insightful I love it. I didn't know that bit about the Roman Holiday in place before Christmas also, so very educational as well. This is the type of argument to up vote.	2
I could not agree more. I'm glad you made this point. Political activism is more or less dead. I was impressed to see the grassroots efforts for Obama, but since the election, that's dropped off entirely.  Although I would say that the pot-smoking community may be more prone to apathy than the rest. I think most are too comfortable with the current laws and too hopeless that they can bring change.	Uriel Sebree (1848–1922) was a career officer in the United States Navy. He entered the Naval Academy during the Civil War and served until 1910, retiring as a rear admiral. He is best remembered for his two expeditions into the Arctic and for serving as the second acting governor of American Samoa	2
if a population wants equal rights that population does not deserve special treatment. hate crimes legislation is an old legislation that needs to be put to rest, there is a new generation coming up, people are no longer seen by color in the vast majority of the population, excluding small groups usually associated with the south... therefore, i say no more hate crime legislation, let those that seek equality truly have it, in rights and in punishment.	I completely concur.	2
Absolutely. As a Hispanic/Latino (whatever) it is automatically assumed that I'm carrying a blade/knife. So I automatically have one leg up on the respect scale..., except from blacks. They carry guns and a gun tromps a knife any day of the week. They know it, I know it, I cow down to them. I wish my race was a bit smarter and carried uzis..., like the Sionists in Israel. I wouldn't mess with those guys, no matter how long and curly their side burns. Wait..., am I being racist ;)	As I have asian skin, people assume I've an IQ of over 200. Which can get rather annoying as I'm not really intelligent, I just know a lot of things. It also doesn't help that my surname is Smart...	2
So true I remember a lot earlier on, probably not as early as what you are referring to, but forever ago, drama was nowhere near this high on here.	Well you guys are lucky.

Just leave it :'(	2
Let me be devil's advocate >:]  Hehehe...Well, I think they do NOT deserve it.  They are homeless, so what? If they want to stay somewhere, we have shelters.  If they deny that, then I don't see why we should force them to accept.  If you wish to give them money,  For all we know, they could spend it on drugs. And if we give, what do they do in return? Mooch of others so they don't have to do the hard work? We work our butts off on money,  just to give it to someone who doesn't work as hard?? From my experience:  Santa Monica.Homeless person sitting, this girl bought a burger from McDonald's. Gave it to him. And guess what he did. GUESS! O:< He THREW it Right back at her. o___o So yeah o__o I will add more later [:	I agree...we already spend lots of taxpayer money on giving to homeless shelters, and (some of us) volunteer a lot of time at the soup kitchen. What more can we do?	2
That's ridiculous, you can totally win on CD. Who has ever heard of the website you posted? Nobody. And even if the article is correct, it talks about aliens, what does that have anything to do with debates, I don't see the point.

Just because you guys have calmed down and stopped killing innocent people everything should be ok? What guarantees do I have that something like that won't happen tomorrow, or in a year?	Technically we've calmed down for 200+ years. Their were many Christians who believed slavery and black inequality was wrong. Currently you have my word that I won't because I'm told to love my enemy.	2
however, the reason that we do not do it is because we think that the things that are better will not be better than the opposite things. Then that's not knowing better. your argument should be on the other side.	As I said, it is a mixture if the two. We know better and don't want to do it. The reason that we don't want to do it is because we think that the things that are not better are actually better. For example, person A knows that stealing is wrong. However, he has a desire for it. He steals something because he wants to steal it and thinks that it is good in some sort of sense: let us say that it will make him feel powerful. Therefore, he knew that it was wrong and knew better; however, he did that which was not better because he desired something that he thought would be better. It is a mixture if the two.	2
We have a homeless guy on our block. He is the nicest guy ever. The best thing is that everybody lets him stay in their house including our house. Everybody just feeds him and clothes him and lets him take a shower and they give him money. He also is good at fixing things so he often fixes things around the neighbor hood.	Well let me know when he dies and there's a need for a replacement homeless guy. I want to sleep in your house and fix things ;)	2

If I understand your question right, yes. I think debate is the highest form of conflict resolution. However it is quite possible to debate in a manner inconsistent with the philosophy.

"What I meant was the country as a whole, like the quality of life here, the corruption in government, etc. By saying ""Either America has always been falling, and that's why I never noticed it, or it's not."" I'm relating it the country it'self to falling off a cliff. If you are always falling off a cliff you won't know what not falling off a cliff is like because falling is natural to you, so if America has been waning in it's quality for as long as I've been alive, I wouldn't know that it was because that'd be normal to me. Yet since I don't feel that it's waning, I can only assume that it's not."	Oh, I see what you're talking about and you are correct but I think we just started the long long drop but do we have a parachute to save us.	2
"There was once me and my friends were evading some patrols in the school , and we hid in a public toilet and wait for things to cool down , then we found out there's a couple making out ... then suddenly one of the patrols point his flashlight at us but we were fast enough to dodge it though (damn I literary hit the deck and got dirt all over) .

Zombi, the root of the word are just a voodoo poisoning-brainwashing trick. The modern idea of 'zombies' are actually vampires. Who don't eat brains. Because that would kill the prey, and poison them. And randomly masacarring people will mean that they themselves get randomly masacarred, which is not an idea they like much.	I agree. Alot of people seem to intertwine what it is that zombies, vampires, and werewolves do- sometimes even ghosts in fiction. I just watched something (forgot what it was) where they killed a vamp with silver.. that's a werewolf dumbass.	2
I'm asking a general question... And put it where?	Notice how there's no reply? ;)	2
The grading system makes it so that in order to determine how well the student actually did you can't look at their grades. You have to look at what kind of classes they took. Then you have to research how much those classes really covered. You can't just say, oh, that person got 10 A's they must be really good. What? You get a grade for each individual class. By looking at their grades, you're already looking at what classes they took...  Thus demonstrating that the grading system doesn't work that well. If you need extra tests in addition to the grades to determine how good the student is, doesn't that mean the grading system failed? The grading system used at schools is not universal. However, usually it's very effective relative to the school and other students there. Of course, if you're comparing students nationwide, standardized tests are more effective in comparing and evaluating students.	What? You get a grade for each individual class. By looking at their grades, you're already looking at what classes they took...  See, you are still describing looking at the actual class which could be eliminated theoretically. I am saying just knowing a GPA could indicate how well they really did. It would certainly make valedictorians more interesting. Especially in college when it goes to an art student. The grading system used at schools is not universal. However, usually it's very effective relative to the school and other students there. Of course, if you're comparing students nationwide, standardized tests are more effective in comparing and evaluating students. Imagine a grading system that was so good that it was universal. We don't have that. See, the grading system could be better.	2

Show where Jesus preached or talked about it in reference to not having to do it.	So, they didn't record the times when Jesus mentioned his dick, that doesn't prove anything. Now I wonder how many times a guy has to talk about Jesus' dick before you stop taking him seriously. What about kosher rules, people don't have to follow that because of Jesus. Bacon is the reason for Jesus followers.	2
In this case, yes. Our educational system has enough problems as it is and we can't afford it... and it's not necessary.	I actually believe the metric system simplifies many of the measurements (powers of 10) and consequently would benefit the students greatly.

If the fat man is really massive enough to stop the trolley, odds are you aren't going to be able to budge him either. Second, even if you could push him onto the tracks, you don't really know if this will stop the train. You could end up killing the fat man and have the kids end up dying anyway.	The test isn't so much about the practicality of it, but your morality.  So, for the sake of debate, assume that you can move him, and assume he would stop the trolley.	2
Pascals wager?  I highly doubt that it didn't occur to a man as intelligent as Blaise Pascal that an omniscient God wouldn't see through feigned belief, Pascal's wager is a ridiculous argument, that when taken seriously regards God as a fool.  Ever heard of the Atheists' wager? You should live your life and try to make the world a better place for your being in it, whether or not you believe in god. If there is no god, you have lost nothing and will be remembered fondly by those you left behind. If there is a benevolent god, he will judge you on your merits and not just on whether or not you believed in him <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist's_Wager'>Source Occam's Razor, does not work for you either, a God/Primer mover is infinitely more complex than anything in existence, we need to make serious leaps of faith based on no quantifiable data in order to invoke God as the creator of the universe, so who is making the most assumptions? HOW the big bang came into existence? Certainly not by making up something. How ALL the materials came into existence? Materials, as in matter? it comes from quantum foam fluctuations all the time. Its just deductive reasoning No, it's begging the question, and it's creating an infinite regress. and to be honest, believing god doesnt exist is more wishful thinking than believing god exists So, believing in an omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent, omnipresent, mind invading, Universe-creating, worship loving, charred livestock smelling, shave hating, shellfish avoiding, homophobic, filicidal, ethnic cleansing, logical contradiction is not wishful thinking? Go back to sleep mate.	"I kept trying to upvote this but my computer acted like I pressed ""pg up"" every time, and scrolled up a bit instead of upvoting. Odd.  I like most of it but I could never buy into the idea of benevolent god; it's one of the main things that drove me from the Christian faith in the first place. You can talk about a good and just god all you like, but if you try to support that with any monotheistic dogma, you're not supported by scripture. The god I keep reading about, in other words, comes across as a deeply disturbed and cruelly vindictive god, more like one of the flawed and imperfect (but still immensely powerful) Greek gods. So I could never take the atheists wager because I think if there is a god, he will not judge me on my merits but on how my actions offended his delicate ego, and I'll fry for eternity because of it. This doesn't mean I don't like the first half of it, though."	2

"Time is not a property of the universe. Time is basically an illusion, it does not really exist, if there weren't that which enable change there would be no such thing as ""time"". Structurally our universe is made of matter and energies which react and affect each other, which causes them to change their location, their consistency, etc. There's no ""time"" anywhere. Time is simply how long one change happened in relation to another, and then, keeping in mind the first, how long it took for one thing to relocate, or how many of the first duration has passed. I'd say time is change, of everything. But then why call it ""time""? Also then time would not apply to only our universe, as not only here happens change (assuming there's more than just this universe). Humans created time. Even though it is useful."	Absolutely, what we call time is essentially the process of matter.	2
No! Final answer Alex!	<a href='http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html'>http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html   ;)	2
I didn't mean to post that for the other side I didn't check what position it had me under.	No honey, I agree with you. I was talking to the other person. .	2
Canada already has a local company called Bombardier that produces high speed trains, so a deal could undoubtedly be worked out. Furthermore, there is a need for a high speed rail network, that way, we can move materials and people more effectively. This will be needed even more as more people come to Canada. Building a high-speed rail network would also create many jobs which are needed as Canada's unemployment rate is about 10%. The only problem is that building such a rail network would be expensive, but if we cancel the F-35 deal, it can be done.	"Sometimes I live in my own little bubble and neglect the fact that not everyone on this site is American. I read the several, wes and kept thinking ""What do you mean we"" but I digress. I think if the country can afford it, and with the deal you presented as a possible bonus, there is no reason not to make the great train. The added benefits of making it also beat out the current system, so I'm all for it."	2
Only the SECRET compartment of my secret box .	Uh huh.... I used to have one of those in my earlier days.	2
Yeah, but worrying about ones own problems is futile when death is certain. It's better to look at the bigger picture...make the world better so that others still have a chance to worry about what they want. Progress is key to a healthy civilization.	So, in the end, that is still helping me with MY OWN problems. Either way, it's all selfish somehow. Fix up the world so I can benefit.  That is progress.	2
Origins of life (creation fits in with evolution and big bang) Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) Several arguments for both the existence if Jesus and his divinity. I'd be up for a debate about that if you'd like. (There are no sound arguments for the divinity of Jesus)	Thanks for taking me up on the offer.  Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) This is completely understandable, however if you pick up any study Bible, you will find this is a declarative statement only. God didn't create the sun, moon, stars, or planets on that day, he simply called the appearance of the sun day, and the appearance or visibility of of the moon night. This is because the clouds or earths atmosphere cleared allowing for you to see the sun and moon from the earth. Jesus Look up celcus (spelling may be wrong, sirry its off the top of me head, he was Egyptian I think) the historian who commented pn Jesus's miracles. The only way he could discredit them is say they were sorcery. If Jesus's miracles were legit (not just getting people high to make it seem like it, yes I've heard that one but how did he get 10,000+ high at once at the feeding of the 5,000 (men)) who else was he?	2
Yeah, I ran out of space in the line, sorry. I mean, he's just making sure everyone knows this girl is taken and that no one else can have her, but he isn't going to make the legal commitment of marriage. Marking his territory with an engagement ring, shows that she's taken.	Did this happen to you? Do you want to get married? What does marriage mean to you? What does it mean to him?	2

"Methinks you are on to something with this line of thinking. The only issue that I see is your contention that you worship logic. I guess if we use the term worship very loosely, worship can refer to devotion to not just beings but principles and systems, but I tend to think of worship as maximal (I'd say excessive) valuing or devotion to a specific real or imaginary being. As an atheist, I have found no being that I consider to be worthy of worship, but I do recognize a ruling -principle- that I regard as being worthy of utter devotion. This principle is love, and is THE philosophical first principle. If love was ordinarily understood as the first principle of one's ""ruling logic"" or theology, and this principle was understood metaphorically as god, I think that today I'd be identifying as theist. What I'm wondering is...Can you articulate your ruling logic....or..... can you introduce me to your ""god""? :)"	"What I'm wondering is...Can you articulate your ruling logic....or..... can you introduce me to your ""god""? :) Just look around. God is all around us. Thinking that God is a single being is the misconception here. God simply creates. It is what creates.  God is also just a state of mind to be reached. When you become fully aware within your brain and body then you will have a deep ""connection"" with all things(god), but the only way to achieve this is through devoted meditation. Through the balancing and proper release of your body's chemicals you can become more human. With this proper release of chemicals you gain the ability to understand all things in various ways, your love for yourself and all things becomes far stronger. It enhances your cognitive abilities basically. God is basically a greatly intelligent and loving being. That means everyone has the potential to be God. o.o It's like an occupation.  ""God"" is only metaphorical. :D"	2
Of course, the terrorist scare is created by the U.S. government in order to secure more power and less liberty.	Also to create more jobs in order to say that the economy got better and thus improve his chances of getting re-elected. ;)	2

No I do not. Just because I question something, does not mean that I switch sides. How very Christian of you. Rolls eyes.	Yeah, the fact she switches sides means she's not just stuck in one train of thought. In fact, I respect Ismaila more than most people I meet BECAUSE of how wishy washy she is. Even if she hates me, and even if I hated her back (I don't), but even if I did, I'd still have to respect her because she's not just some complacent fool who accepts what they're told.	2
Thanks for the laugh. On a serious note, why does it always seem to be the case that the most fervent Christians are also the most tied onto money? I'd love to know where that mutation in dogma came from.	I don't know if that's necessarily the case, it seems to depend on where you're looking. In wealthy first world nations that fetishize capitalism you tend to find a lot of money grubbing Jesus praisers... in societies that place higher value on other social focuses you tend to find people who champion those causes doing the same thing.  In general, I think you'll find the real pattern is that people always declare Jesus likes what they like, and who pay minimal attention to what Jesus actually is supposed to have said in that bible thing they wave around but rarely open. Which is an amazing coincidence, don't you think?	2
"Joe just let me know about your Music Box. Great idea. How would any of us know when someone posts to it? Will it show up as a new ""debate?"" I'm still learning my way around the site and learning its various features. Would the Music Box work as a ""Debate Community""? I'm thinking it would be easier to be notified of new posts that way."	Im not out to make it a community , its just a music box.  Drop by before debating to get pumped up or drop by at the end of debating to wind down or drop by whenever you like . This way you will see the latest contributions.	2
It's never too late. They are probably out there walking around with their little walkers or something, I say kick that walker right from under them ;)	You, my good sir, are a genius. No sarcasm. A hilarious genius.	2
It relates because it says It basically just says God created the universe in the description.	"It also says; ""Even if you don't believe in this religion, would you have a problem with it?"" Like what I said, this isnt a debate about God's existence"	2

Sorry, I simply wouldn't design any political structure because it involves central planning and coercion though miniscule amounts of force is required in a civilized society.

Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true You'll see it's all a show Keep 'em laughing as you go Just remember that the last laugh is on you Monty Python-Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life. I don't see how posting song lyrics is relevant, unless you have a reason...	"Yeah I agree. Though nothing against that kind of music and it is better to have people supporting it rather then that current main stream music. But posting it will not change anyones opinion it is just showing what it is. I would like to say though you can normally not understand what they are saying and it just sounds like somebody kicked them in the balls. The lyrics are not important though I think most just like the loud noise as it gets your adrenalin going or something like that. I am happy getting my adrenaline going with lets say Mozart "" Requiem Dies Irae "". Now this I can twiddle my finger to while I drink a cup of tea and not get scared by the guy with the funny hairstyle."	2
"""that God was either always there or was created from nothing."" You're assumption was probably correct. But we're talking about two extremes here. All I'm saying is that God could have been created from something els. This does open up a whole new can of worms. Some would call this blasphemy but I think it shows humility to accept that we don't just don't know."	All I'm saying is that God could have been created from something els. This does open up a whole new can of worms.  Yea, logically it's an infinite regress, but in most, especially Abrahamic, faiths it is taught that God is eternal, and this is more a stretch of logic than to assume matter and energy are eternal, or at least their formation from each other. Some would call this blasphemy but I think it shows humility to accept that we don't just don't know. In think that those that would call it blasphemy are those that feel uncomfortable with the presented truths, and probably suffer a dualism in their beliefs but lean towards that which provides the most comfort.	2
I think simply understanding it goes a long way toward mitigating its effects.	Yes, and there's been a lot of fascinating and hopeful studies on this in social psychology.  from wiki Preventing groupthink According to Irving Janis, decision making groups are not necessarily doomed to groupthink. He also claims that there are several ways to prevent it. Janis devised seven ways of preventing groupthink (209-15):  1. Leaders should assign each member the role of “critical evaluator”. This allows each member to freely air objections and doubts.  2. Higher-ups should not express an opinion when assigning a task to a group.  3. The organization should set up several independent groups, working on the same problem.  4. All effective alternatives should be examined.  5. Each member should discuss the group's ideas with trusted people outside of the group.  6. The group should invite outside experts into meetings. Group members should be allowed to discuss with and question the outside experts.  7. At least one group member should be assigned the role of Devil's advocate. This should be a different person for each meeting. By following these guidelines, groupthink can be avoided. After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, John F. Kennedy sought to avoid groupthink during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[3] During meetings, he invited outside experts to share their viewpoints, and allowed group members to question them carefully. He also encouraged group members to discuss possible solutions with trusted members within their separate departments, and he even divided the group up into various sub-groups, in order to partially break the group cohesion. JFK was deliberately absent from the meetings, so as to avoid pressing his own opinion. Ultimately, the Cuban missile crisis was resolved peacefully, thanks in part to these measures.	2

Yeah... I uploaded this one a couple days ago but it didn't appear on my end until last night.	You probably needed to clear your cache. ;)	2
There are some people on here that it is impossible to convince that they are wrong because they are just too close minded and refuse to see another point of view except their own but there are some people on here who are open minded and interested in learning and seeing things from another point of view, it all depends who you are debating.	"""Open up your mind and see like me"". Haha. I have seen a few people alter their position. Usually only a little and after great effort. What is most bothersome is when a person drops the whole context of debating and just starts insulting the opposition."	2

Dangers are always going to exist, whether or not the next generation learns of them; how else could they have come into existence? To answer your reference to sexuality, I believe that there is no problem with introducing children to the concept. I personally learned a great deal by reading pre-20th century sadomasochistic erotica; I would recommend nearly anything else as an introduction, preferably before they find the stuff I found. Nothing can scare and scar a young child like The 120 Days of Sodom or The Romance of Lust.	Please, I can totally beat you there. My nurse gave me a book about periods and pregnancy- I think they were meant for the eighth graders- before checking my age, and being the overtly-curious, precocious, bookworm of a ten year old that I was, I didn't correct her. I read the book... than I slept fetal position for several months because I was scared of the descriptions. It was like pre-packaged, glorified porn for middle schoolers! And the nurse gave it to me!	2
Well, you keep finding me so I must not be hiding very well ?	it's your wonderful smell that keeps giving you away :P	2

I look up American definition for mint. It say this. Main Entry: 1mint Pronunciation: \ˈmint\ Function: noun Etymology: Middle English minte, from Old English, from Latin mentha, menta; akin to Greek minthē mint Date: before 12th century 1 : any of a family (Labiatae, the mint family) of aromatic plants with a square stem and a 4-lobed ovary which produces four one-seeded nutlets in fruit ; especially : any of a genus (Mentha) of mints that have white, purple, or pink verticillate flowers with a nearly regular corolla and four equal stamens and that include some used in flavoring and cookery. You eat plant instead of gum? It unusual. Are you American?	mint is really a flavor derived from some herb. so yeah, it was a plant really. still is.	2
Of course not... but have they ever made a really good freaky movie about it? Because that could be good.	I don't think they have really made any horror movies about the Bermuda triangle	2
"I saw one that was a private religious debate with the title ""I'm tired of Athiests, blah, blah, blah."", something like that. So it obviously isn't a debate. It's just a group of people with the same opinion talking about why they hate Athiests."	No, no, no, they just change the title, private status etc. This is the new norm on CD... trust me, it takes more than one person to be a group.	2
Yeah.. because the greatest man, the best nice good man but no faith in god sent to hell.. And the bad worst man, killer rapist pedophiles...will be saved if he have faith in god and sent to heaven.

This side has the answer ^	I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. May or may not have been intentional :)	2
But we can give probability to a claim. Just because two claims may be true, doesn't make them equiprobable. For example, I could claim that a piece of toast created the universe. Does that make it as likely as the Big Bang?	Obviously, I never denied that. But scientific theory dictates that before something can't be claimed as fact until it reaches the probability of sigma 5, something like 1 in 3 million chance of being wrong. Therefore, it would be wrong to assert anything until it reaches this level. I also only gave one reasoning against theistic arguments, I have more, I hardly think they are equal.	2
The American dream is to move higher up in social class. Not move down. The wealthy pay 52% of Americas taxes.	I agree with you but at the same time disagree with you. How are the people who aren't rich going to move up if the taxes are too high. Not to mention I believe the rich can help us a little by paying a bit more taxes. I believe that they should be paying a bit more of taxes then us not alot but more. Its unfair if we have to pay the same amount if the person is making more money. I do agree however we should let the rich keep some of there money. So that way they'll be able to build businesses. I still think however the rich should be paying a bit more then us.	2
As a debate site such drama should be expected with the powers given to us.	OMG! You've given me an idea! We need a sister site, CD - CreateDrama!	2
logicsoup could you give me more informaition or a page about this because I have a debate on monday please	Well if you search up on Google, I am sure that you could find much better knowledge than I could ever offer you, but I guess another important thing to note would be, tensions about Slavery (and the size of the government), could largely be accredited to the western land acquisitions we received through expansion. Basically after we had acquired all those states, the issue in Congress, was wether these states should be able to have legalized slavery. To my knowledge, Congress said no, and basically the Southern and newly acquired states were pissed off because the government (that was increasing in size) said the newly acquired states could not have slaves. I don't know if that really helps you, but it is some general knowledge that could aid you in your search, or give you some ideas.	2
i can't think of better entertainment for the kids, install a stripper pole for real fun	Heavens no! The kids might get hurt ; )	2
Public groups would be gangs, and general racists that flock to one another. A neo nazi is mostly a blanket term for people with a racist fear of people not of their race.	Oh okay. I had no idea. So these gangs are just people trying to keep the Nazi reign alive?	2
Part of the reason is because girls generally have shorter legs than guys, so we have to walk faster to keep up. Usually.	walk faster to keep up Or get away? ;)	2
because people can being selling drugs late out night doing bad things. and all of the bad thing are happening at night so i think that they should be monitoring the streets often	True, all these gangs have nothing to worry about at night. Police should be out working.	2
People need to realize that if they aren't Christians then they will go to hell.  We Christians just care about you! We don't want to know that when you die, you are going to suffer for all eternity.	So you care about everybody, even if you don't know them?	2
Yup. Usualy they get either instantaneously discarded or extremely made fun of. Often the second option is the prefered one.	I just disregard them. They've probably been told before that they need to go back to school and I don't see the point in wasting my time to be another one.	2
It's up to you to define respect. it's your opinion on weather something is respectable or not. and for beliefs use a dictionary	"Respect can mean many things: that we allow it to be believed, that we honor it as a belief, that we honor the people, that we.... What does ""respect"" mean? Belief can mean many things as well: an opinion, a fact, a mixture of facts and opinion, religious ideologies, ... What does ""belief"" mean?"	2
Steroids are and should be illegal because of its dangers. Not only that steroids is cheating in professional sports like baseball. If you hit a homerun its not you hitting it , its the steroids. How could you compare something steroids makes you do compared to if you get a homerun just by working out. Steroids make people break records from other people that actually got the record without the juice. Steroids are illegal in sports and should stay illegal.	These people who have had records like babe Ruth, are people who are baseball legends, and will never be forgotten imagine the amount of credit he would get for being able to hold that record for those many years and the only person able to break the record was someone who took steroids. These people are the only reason why baseball is still existing after all these years and this is a sport shadowed by Football. If pro baseball players took steroids and enhanced the game than more people would watch it and save it from being a backseat sport like polo.	2
But what if it's real and your technology makes it look as if it were an illusion	Thats what im saying, what could this be if not a fake, in todays world we can technically blame everything on technology and its a shame because this leads people to not really investigate things like we use to, in a sense our minds and curiosity grew lazy.	2
I saw Satan once. Does that count? .	I thought you were Satan once. Does that count? LOL	2
"If it was a God congregation where people discuss what they are thankful for and attribute it to God, but don't look down on those who don't attribute it to God, I think they could get some Atheists to show up. They might get a few to show up, but I think they would be few and far between. I know I wouldn't go.  Their charter seems very contradictory. It says, ""Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential. Our vision: a godless congregation in every town, city and village that wants one."" The first sentence says ""everyone"" but the second sentence says ""a godless congregation."" A godless congregation is not ""everyone."" I just think if someone is going to start a new church with the motto ""live better, help often, wonder more"" whose goal is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"", then saying things that make people feel excluded is unwise and makes me question their motives. If I'm questioning their motives and I'm an atheist, I can't imagine how distrustful a theist would be of them. I would have to see what the do in this congregation because I can't even imagine it at all. I agree. The whole concept seems very strange to me and I would have to go to one to see what really goes on there."	"The first sentence says ""everyone"" but the second sentence says ""a godless congregation."" A godless congregation is not ""everyone."" It really only sounds like it is excluding God, and He ain't a person. ;) I just think if someone is going to start a new church with the motto ""live better, help often, wonder more"" whose goal is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"", then saying things that make people feel excluded is unwise and makes me question their motives. If I'm questioning their motives and I'm an atheist, I can't imagine how distrustful a theist would be of them. What are they supposed to say? ""A congregation that isn't centered around God""?"	2
Basically the point I was going to make, I would add though that those that think we are some sort of evolutionary pinnacle are greatly deluded, and lack a serious understanding of what evolution or more natural selection does.  Also, have an upvote.	Oh yes, I agree completely. Humans are not the best full stop. We are the best at what we are adapted to. Give us some materials and we'll make tools. But try and make us fly, or breathe underwater, or catch zebras, and we fail miserably. Of course, our tools can do this, but we can't.	2
clarify for me, because in your original argument it was put as in favor of throwing out evolution, but sometimes when people make an argument they don't pay attention to that. If you are on the side of the argument of it being thrown out then my refutation is called for, if you are not for evolution being thrown out of schools, then I apologize for the misunderstanding (though in the future you might want to pay attention to that). EDIT: I came back to this debate and thought this argument was a reply to me, my bad. ignore.	All I am saying is not if it is right or wrong but support for banning it is growing check the link I posted	2

Depends on school policy, the location and host of the dance and the gun. Did it have it's general-obvious indicator that it was fake? This friend (joking or not) still threatened someone else.  I think some good suspension (in or out of school) would do just fine.	I agree. If it didn't happen at school, I don't think they can do anything. BUT, if it was on school property- absolutely. At LEAST suspension. Lessons need to be learned.	2

"What is the point of blocking certain words from viewers? What are we trying to hide? Why do people care in the first place about one word that is considered ""taboo"" to be said. The whole idea of censoring words is similar to censoring certain movements. If someone lifts up their arm and raises their middle finger, this is understood as offensive. Pointing at someone is considered ""rude."" So what happens when I stick my arms out and spin around? If I do this trying to be offensive, should everyone else understand it as offensive? I doubt they would.  This is an argument that has been made before, but is important, and I believe that this argument should not be forgotten. There are certain collections of sounds; certain collections of movements, which in certain cultures, are offensive.  As for nudity; kind of the same idea. We're all born with one of two sets of parts. About half of the people on Earth have one set, and about half have another set. Should I not be allowed to see something because I don't have it? It's part of the human body. And once you see it once, what's the point of censoring it again? You've already seen it, so what are they protecting you from there? I don't get it. If someone feels that they can explain it to me, go ahead. Either reply to me here or leave a message on my profile, but either way, I'm serious. I really have no clue why people blindly agree with these preconceptions."	I agree with you, all this censorship is artificial and doesn't refer to anything real. It's just in the head of who sees, so it comes down to a matter of tolerance. Some are offended by bad words; others are offended by images of dead people, bombs and destruction, but no one is taking them out of the news.  All kinds of censorship are purely cultural, and as such, are not there because they are the best thing for us, but because of a tradition that takes time to change. I have some male Muslim friends who go abroad and get overwhelmed by all the female skin they are able to see. Was it better for them to grow up without seeing a girl's skin and hair? Or were they deprived of some important understanding of the world? The same can be argued about the occidental views on nudity. Our bodies are part of nature. Our way of reproducing too.	2

Iamdavidh,  Been here for a year and call others lame. Lame is clearly the words of a loser. Your opinion is just that and nobody really cares about it. To know it most be such a burden. An atheist that plays God.	"Yes, he's been here a year and he's established a good following and is a great debater. I'm pretty sure he's allowed to say ""lame"" when he wants.

I was about 16 when i first got into politics up until that point it was just background niose, travelling really changed how i viewed the world though. Politics is inescapable really, i mean most people couldn't give a fuck but they're still aligned in somebodies camp. For most people (as least as far as i can tell) there politcal views are decided for them, thats why i was impressed with your views, they seem like your own, not something your father forced on you, or something you were indocrinated the beleive.	They are my own. Lol  I don't form many of my judgments until I've gone through the facts myself usually. And I'll admit when I actually have no idea what I'm talking about XD Which, depending on the subject, can be often.	2
There's nude pics of his mom on-line... don't bother, it's not worth it. LOL	Gross.... Yeah, not worth it! Vote for president Jacob and I will bribe Andy to let you get away with all sorts of trolling! A president we all can trust.	2
He was fiscally liberal and socially conservative. From what you've said, you're not very socially liberal. Might like to add that disagreeing with you doesn't make someone incorrect.	Somebody who is fiscally liberal and socially conservative is a government loving totalitarian, and totalitarians are the pure evil in this world, this means Hitler was probably a pretty fucked up person he was more evil than I thought and I thought he was pretty fucking evil!	2
"But the majority of Christendom doesn't think like you do. Most Christians are against homosexuality in some way or another and they generally oppose abortion. You stated the fact that you are ""prochoice progay"" as support for your assertion that you are not closed minded; it is fair to assume, then, that you believe antichoice and antigay sentiments indicate closed mindedness. When we consider, then, that most Christians conform to beliefs and behaviors that you yourself consider to be the opposite of your open-mindedness, does it really seem so unfair to you for Brainsikk to ask if Christians are often too close minded? You might not be closed minded, but then you're not a typical Christian. Typical Christians often believe in things directly opposed to your open-minded beliefs, so if we are asked if Christians are often too close minded, we can say yes."	Fair enough. You unfortunately, are right. Thank you for the compliment. I do not want to be the typical Christian. I want to make a difference. :)	2
Latino race has proven to be one of the best at making porn and I am definitely telling you that I am not embarrassed to admit this. Also if we base it on IQ alone I am pretty sure that brown asians win that, it's just a trait of their bloodline.Yes, even stubborn Arabs often are extremely fast at picking up things such as mathematics and physics. Caucasians are more theory-inclined or practically-inclined but very rarely are able to excel at jobs such as engineering that require both skills at once. They are also the most artistic race. Yellow/Oriental Asians are very talented at fields of extremely practical work, whether banking or martial arts that require little time to rest and much more of a chop-chop-chop style of thinking. Native Americans and Eskimos (which I consider a race by themselves) have proven the best at hunting and raw survival skills. Black people: Fast linguistic abilities and sport of course :)	Very true, blacks have very good vocal and musical skills. When the British went deeper in to Africa they where shocked at how fast they picked up English.	2

uh a gay person doesn't want to marry someone of the opposite sex. why the hell would you even think they would. By the way that's two different rights. There's same sex marriage and str8 marriage and gay people don't marry people from the opposite sex for some obvious reasons. Gays currently can not adopt children. Yes str8 people have to meet requirements but they won't let gays have kids because there afraid of how the child will react.	"uh a gay person doesn't want to marry someone of the opposite sex. OK, so that's like saying, ""The law is that you can drink all the alcohol you want. But I don't want to drink alcohol. I want to smoke marijuana. My rights are being violated!"" Again, there are no two different rights. Marriage is not a right. It is sanctioned by a religion and a priviledge that the government can take away. That is why you need a marriage license to get married. You need a license because it is not a right. In order to adopt children, you must be a male and female couple. It does not say, you must be a heterosexual and a heterosexual female couple. A single heterosexual male cannot adopt. A single heterosexual female cannot adopt. It is not discrimination against gays."	2
Ah, but coffee is just a drink...	Exactly. People don't consider coffee a drug, for what I can only imagine is because the effects are not as strong as an actual 'drug'.	2
Oh, come on!!! Really??? Master Buddhist claim to be able to float while meditating and the other Buddhist claim to have seen it. Someone's on drugs ;)	Buddhists do not practice levitation.  Yet another Western misconception.	2
Yes, it should be the responsibility of the individual to attend school. If they fail because they don't go to lessons, it's their fault.	Students should have the freedom to freely skip lessons at school. Do not simply assume that students would skip all classes and just go around doing nothing. Responsible students would attend interesting classes and skip the less interesting ones. The time would be a benefit. It is in their purview to cope up with the missed classes. But, you should give them the freedom to decide which class to attend and which not to.	2
Gosh I'm screwing with ya calm down I read all that stuff but I saw a lot of debates and stuff about how you get angry so quickly	It is hard to read social skills on the internet, sometimes even in person because of those things I told you.

We could start taming dinosaurs, and have them fight against each other and name all their cool and unique moves. We could have those go out and collect each individual dinosaur at the age of ten, call themselves, a dinosaur trainer. Have gyms set up where gym leaders battle dinosaur trainers, and if they are beaten they give the trainer a badge. If you collect all eight badges you can go to a dinosaur tournament where all the best trainers go to battle each other's dinosaurs. We can nickname them, and have a strong philosophy revolving around young kid's love between their dinosaurs and them. ;)	I'm pretty sure that's animal cruelty. 	2

7 Christian Sins In bible: 1. A proud look. 2. A lying tongue. 3. Hands that shed innocent blood. 4. A heart that devises wicked plots. 5. Feet that are swift to run into mischief. 6. A deceitful witness that uttereth lies. 7. Him that soweth discord among brethren. As revised by Pope Gregory I lust gluttony greed sloth wrath envy pride 	I like lust and sloth. I basically just like to lay there and let her do all the work. So..., that's my best set of sins ;) Oh..., wait..., did you mean something else ;)	2

There have actually been scientific studies that have supported the idea that humans are actually polygamous.

The leader in question has more power and more freedom in this situation. The next of kin can be the next ruler but if you feel like your army leader would rule better, you can do that you're in control.	How does a dictator have more power than an absolute monarch.

"My dad's girlfriend grew up in the Soviet Union, and her mother was AAA gunner in Stalingrad.  Though, the ""Russian's"" weren't worse than the Nazis. They did not systematically exterminate entire races, the gulags were more rehabilitate, though they were ghastly. P.S. Stalin was a Georgian."	"I've talked people who lived in the Ukraine, fought with resistance and had their entire village murdered. Since the Nazis hating a specif ""race"" (religion) make them worse? As if the USSR had nothing against Jews or Christians. The gulags were no better than Hitler's camps.  PS: Georgia and Ukraine are two separate places and maintain separate identities."	2
it could work it would just take a lot of time to transition into, but its not impossible, its not like money is a requirement for life to live on a planet, i dont recall any scientific studies that said money is one of the necessities of life... But we do need some form of currency with humans, whether it be trading goods or whatnot	Of course it would take time...Rome wasn't build in one day. Or maybe money would be substituted by another paying system...?	2

I dont know about the violence, but they have definetly gotten out of hand for sexuality. I mean c'mon, what was the point of the sex scene in Watchmen or the sexual content in Julie and Julia as already mentioned!	The outcome of a debate may be decided by audience vote, by judges, or by some combination of the two. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leaders debates and the U.S. presidential election debates, are common in democracies.	2
"Looking from the perspective of an etymologist, I'll have to take the ""no"" side. They can form a union, but ""marriage"" is not the accurate word for that. Marriage comes from the Latin words (rather, word-forms, for they both are derived from the same lammata) marita/meritus meaning wife/husband. Matrimonium essentially is that state from whence comes motherhood - an homosexual union precludes parenthood.  So, whilst I support the marriage-like union of the homosexual, I cannot support the actual marriage, for such is inconsistent with the etymology of marriage."	That's very clever, but could we not just let it slide? If they want to get married, would it be so much effort to just ignore the etymology and let them get married?	2
Since the man technically made the baby by fermentation he should be able to weigh in on the decision for an abortion or not right? Sorry for being so technical but it asks if she should weigh in on the decision for abortion. Since the abortion is an all or nothing choice the answer comes down to his say or her say, so I personally don't believe he can add anything, even if it is his DNA. Yet I understand how others would disagree with me, stating that it his dna.	I see. I woud assume that we have two separate viewpoints on this debate.	2
Everyone should have freedom of mind. And that includes the choice to alter the state of mind using recreational drugs.  Even if there were something morally wrong with it, it would still be wrong for the use to remain illegal, but there is nothing inherently immoral about it. Marijuana, peyote, these are natural. And they have positive effects when used appropriately.	"I must agree on this ""Even if there were something morally wrong with it, it would still be wrong for the use to remain illegal, but there is nothing inherently immoral about it. Marijuana, peyote, these are natural. And they have positive effects when used appropriately."" Here is a personal debate I had with my mother-in-law. And this may open up a new can but could something be moral or immoral based on how it is taken. She claims it is perfectly fine to use THC however it is completely immoral to smoke weed. How can one be right and one be wrong if you end up in the same state of mind?  Personally I believe God put us on this Earth to choose how we want to live our lives. But a bunch of guys got burs up there asses and decided to take away certain freedoms. I believe what the government has done be making these things, drugs that have no affect on other people when you use them, illegal is what is immoral. That's just me... take it for what it is worth."	2
That actually explains a lot. ;)	Hmm? Long Shore Drift I was talking about. You know, the coastal process of transportation and deposition of sands along the beach.

Its funny cause at least God judged people on their conscious actions. Actually, no he didn't. He condemned all of mankind because of the actions of Adam and Eve. It wasn't my conscious decision to inherit the sins of my forefathers and be punished for what they did. What conscious action did the slaves take that was worthy of punishment when god said it was okay to beat them? Exodus 21:20-21 What conscious action did the young girls take that was worthy of punishment when he said it was okay to sell them? Exodus 21:7-11 Its funny how the same people who say Gods judgements are unfair, are all for the slaughter of unborn children. At least God judged conscious actions. And why is it wrong to terminate the life of something that has no consciousness? What is it about killing that makes it wrong? I've asked this to people who are against abortion many times but have never received a response. Do you believe gods judgements are fair? Is beating your slaves a fair thing to do? Is selling your daughters fair to them? Is killing someone for trying to be helpful fair? 2 Samuel 6:1–7 Is subjecting people to eternal torment for finite and minor crimes fair? These are not rhetorical question. I want you to answer them truthfully.	Thoughts on Exodus 20:20-21. Congrads, you found a verse that involves harming a slave. However let's take a quick look at what this context is. Slavery was first of all not supported by God. God established humane limits on an already evil and cruel system. The Hebrews were already knowledgeable of what it felt to bein slavery. Along with this, the slave owners were told by God to treat their slaves fairly and with respect. They were given a day of rest (Ex. 20:10). They were to encouraged to attend religious services (DT. 12:12,18;16:11). Israelites slaves were to be treated with extra benevolence, being freed after 6 years (Ex. 21:2; DT. 15:12) or in the Year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:40-41). Female slaves who become wives to their owners were to be given all respect as a normal wife (Ex. 21:8-11). When a term of.slavery ended the slave had to be a gift (DT. 15:13-14). If a slave receives excessive physical abuse they are granted freedom (Ex. 21:26-27) and is considered a crime. Through these measures we see moses, by God, meant slaves were human beings and granted rights by their creator. So in context I believe the allowed physical abuse is like that of disciplining a child and yes I say and agree this is fair. I will comment on the others later.	2

Well based on the video he saved the people. I believe it is assumed in the video that there are more bad people.

Ahh, I see where you come from, But those animals were being allowed to live there with the native Americans, the animals before those animals have all died out. Humans should learn to accept other peoples way of living rather than forcing their home right from under their feet.	Accepting other's peoples way of living? What about when there is not enough space? You believe that if there is only one home, that the people who lived their already are entitled to it, while the people who came along and have the ability to take it should not try to? I mean if you do, I'm not saying whether that's bad or good, i just feel that survival should come 1st, and if sharing isn't a possibility then you have to take. Same with eating other animals. We can't take a single limb so we kill the whole animal.	2

"Death being before sin is my interpretation. The current is as you said, sin lead to death. However what did the canivours eat in the time between their creation and the fall? Many canivours in fact most canivours reject plant fiber. In Genesis 1 it says Adam was given plants ""for meat"". I went back to the Hebrew and the word is used the same as the meat sacrifices that the isrealites. That means Adam had to see meat being eaten for God to make that identification.  When God makes Adam their is a complete literary shift, hinting a change in influence. The word ""our"" is used instead also hinting a difference in influence. I believe man was created divinely and literally breathed life into, separate from the animals. The animals were created ""after their kind"" man was not. Animals evolved, man did not. I believe this because of both biblical and scientific reasons."	"The animals were created ""after their kind"" man was not. Animals evolved, man did not. I believe this because of both biblical and scientific reasons. Animals were created in the same manner as Adam and Eve. Plants grew without rain (illogical). In fact you cannot be correct. Animals came after Adam. They spawned. That is incredibly illogical."	2
"Do you have any idea how the verses went? I don't think that Jesus ever said anything like that, at least not according to the Bible. Are you thinking about when they rise from the grave and Jesus separates ""the sheep from the goats""?"

Atheists, self-proclaimed, choose the term of atheist to disassociate themselves from religion. However, most atheists are over-looking the fact that they are, more rightfully and rationally, heretics. And in my personal opinion modern day Christianity is the mother of Atheism, while God and truth are the progenitors of heretic-ism. I'll explain more if warranted.	Please do. (explain) Do you mean that Atheism is some sort of post-christianity? - with the morals but discarding the fantasy?? If I understand you correctly, I would rather say that the scientific method is the mother of atheism.	2
And no, Chi can be manipulated at will it would not need adrenaline surge reserves.  I only said it may be possible for them to tap into their adrenaline to give them a boost, not that they were actually doing it. All I am saying is that what they are doing is within the realm of science, they haven't done anything undeniably supernatural. Science may be a bit baffled or confused on the matter at the moment, but there is no reason to believe their abilities are outside of the realm of science.  Btw, this may very well be natural but just because it seems alien to you so thats why it is supernatural. It doesn't seem alien to me. I'm fascinated by it. Everything that we have studied we are either still studying it, or we have found a naturalistic explanation for it. Nothing so far has conclusively had a supernatural explanation.	Anything beyond the realm of science does not exist other wise the effects could not be felt. Feng-shui, Chi and other practices are a science of its own with its own explanation, 'lab', 'apparatus' and variables without changing any laws that currently disocovered by man. Just plain energy. It is too humble to brag about (yet great). Otherwise David Blaine would'nt be able to take a punch in the abdomen from a mix martial artist ( I believe I mentioned Chi is placed there). Or last 17 minutes without oxygen. However thank you for being patient with this topic. I have seen forums where people compared chi with flying spaghetti monsters. However it is a topic worthy of research, and if not maybe the philosophical aspect of Taoism.	2

"I've said it before and I'll say it again. The way the Bible is written, the effect it can have on people, the evil that has been done in its name, it seems more likely to be the work of the Devil than any divinely inspired prophet. I don't even believe in the devil, but I'd put his authorship of the Bible as being more likely than God telling selected men to ""tell it like it is""."	"I think Old Testament is a little over the top. New Testament is too, but Jesus actually did have some good moral teachings.  I think both good things and bad things can come out of religion, but the same could be said about science. Wars have been fought over religion and science has helped provide the weapons. Atheists tend to look at religion and only see the harm it has caused, but they look at science and tend to just see the good... but what about the negative impacts it has had on us? Weapons, pollution, chemicals in our food and so on. Religion brings people together and allows them to look at the sky and see more than just flaming balls of gas.  All of that being said, I respect science as much as I respect religion. I'm an agnostic, so I don't really believe one way or the other, but I once read that ""science and religion are two different languages telling the same story"". How accurate that statement is, I do not know... but it does sound pretty damn cool! lol"	2

That does not mean he is ok with the bad choices we make, but he does understand that we are human and make mistakes, through his son we can be forgiven again.	2

Truth is such a strong word. Positions are like the shifting sands of the Sahara forest, which my great, great uncle (the greatest lumber jack that ever lived) used to work in.	What is really true does not change with the wind IMO. Opinions may change but truth usually does not. The only non-example of this is scientific truth, which is almost always evolving. Unfortunately, when issues of science are politicized, the first thing that usually gets through out the window is the truth, and I say that as a scientist myself.	2

Totally, it helps prevent racism because it will create more mixed children which will mean everybody is basically the same. So, with more interracial marriages the country will get better.

"Why wouldn't God consider... hmm... I dunno... LOWER FERTILITY RATES. To bring God into this is to assume that the design is supposed to be perfect, once again, intelligent does not mean perfect. Who is to say that it was a ""God"" who designed it? It could very well have been a fallible being with the potential to create things and there could be more than one of them.  It could have been a group project between highly intelligent beings."	Excuse me for assuming you weren't a hipster unlike 90% of the believers in God/s. I was debating on the premise that God was a perfect, compassionate being that valued every single individual life and that the death of someone suffocating by breathing and eating through the same hole would be contradictory. But since you don't follow that common belief, we have nothing much to say, since I am open to the belief that we may have been created by imperfect beings other than JEBUS.	2

I am sorry, but Muslims know their religion better than nonmuslims. I was not trying to be rude. :'(	I never said you were being rude? But if you were serious about the question Google might be a better way to go because I really don't think there are very many Muslims on this site.	2
I think you're referring to an act of witchcraft, such as summoning, incantation, manipulation, etcetera, that can be done by anyone whether they call themselves a witch or not. I'm referring to a sustained 'hobby' if you like.	I think an argument could be made to say that prayer in any religion is a form of witchcraft. You do an incantation to make someone fall in love with you (hypothetically). As I understand it, your incantation is supposed to please or be accepted by some deity or something that agrees to make it all happen. It's the same in other religions. We pray for something to happen.	2
Absolute or objective truth is a figment of our imagination because objective truth is rooted in man made, and there is only subjective truth as pointed out with the example of typing online.	Granting that everything we know, we know subjectively, this does not fully prevent us from having any true knowledge whatsoever. In other words.... You cannot know that you know nothing, because that would be knowing something.	2
I've heard some from them, but not enough to note. Do you know of King Crimson, the music of mad scientists?	No, I haven't heard of King Crimson, the music of mad scientists. Where can I pirate some of their music ;)	2
Why don't they use the challenge debate feature instead of banning everybody else?	Please check your message. I just sent a message to you. We all are humans and shouldn't indulge in conflict. Please check the message.	2
Little high, little low anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me.... to-oo me	"""now im here"" ""dont stop me now"" ""play the game"" What about  Flash Gordon, Sheer Heart Attack, The Game, News Of The World, A Night At the Opera, Live Killers, The Works , Jazz etc."	2
DDO? 	DDO stands for Debate.org  	2
Srom, this guy is obviously a troll and in fact, he's most likely an atheist trying to make theists look bad. It's the same thing that Mic did/does... Mic pretends to be an idiot American... this dude pretends to be an idiot Theist.	this dude pretends to be an idiot Theist. I should really try it out myself too. Just to see how easy theists have it. There would be one major difference... I'd actually have to think how to proceed, what exactly to say, to make it seem very delusional and stupid, and to try not give myself off. Could be fun, but I doubt I will.	2
Who is to say that skilled basketball players cannot be skilled at acting as well? There are always those multi-talented individuals.	Did you see the video? There are no multi-talented, skilled, basketball players that can act ;)	2
Although sleazy does match the profile of any politician, Batman definitely has a better education and upbringing. Iron man is too haphazard and would probably end up passing some giant tax loopholes for his corporate buddies. Batman on the other hand would protect the weak and support and more Democratic party system.	You hit the nail on the head. I like the Robinhood tack that Batman lives by. I think Batman is a Democrat an Ironman is a Republican.	2
That doesn't sound anything like the show. . .	Haha very funny...	2
"The bible is never specific as to what it implies. However the connotatuon given is not evolution, but divine spawning of inhabitant creatures.  ""And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being"" Genesis 2:7 By analyzing the syntax we can assume that God made Adam from dust, and not by evolutionary circumstances. God made Adam dead. He was just a cadaver. God ""breathed"" life into him and he was created. I would imagine God doing the same for all animals. Actually I am positive he performed the same act of the divine uprising of life. They were created from dust. Earth material. Also if you are a Evolutionist Christian you are denying the fact that death comes as a result of sin. If evolution is true then death already existed."	"Death being before sin is my interpretation. The current is as you said, sin lead to death. However what did the canivours eat in the time between their creation and the fall? Many canivours in fact most canivours reject plant fiber. In Genesis 1 it says Adam was given plants ""for meat"". I went back to the Hebrew and the word is used the same as the meat sacrifices that the isrealites. That means Adam had to see meat being eaten for God to make that identification.  When God makes Adam their is a complete literary shift, hinting a change in influence. The word ""our"" is used instead also hinting a difference in influence. I believe man was created divinely and literally breathed life into, separate from the animals. The animals were created ""after their kind"" man was not. Animals evolved, man did not. I believe this because of both biblical and scientific reasons."	2
It wont take away 10 point you just need to have 10 points to post a debate. 	Ok then that's fine but I think most of the spammers usually already have 10 points and then they start spamming.	2
Obviously Titanic! Screw Avatar................! You Losers!!!!!!!! I hate that F Movie! How dare this debate even exists.....?!!!!! Excuse me for the Rant:-(!	I feel the same way that you do, but the debate is questioning whihc movie has the right to hold the position of best selling movie of all time.	2
As has been pointed out elsewhere, urine is essentially sterile as long as you don't have kidney or urinary tract infections. The only real source of contaminants if you urinate in the shower are your urethra, which shouldn't be an issue if you have no infection, and your skin, which is contaminating the shower anyway.	Very well. -.-  ______________________	2
I thought we were cool. I am not perfect, but damn. I am only irrational when people judge me or piss me off. If I was so irrational, I would be cussing you out right now, and I am not. I am trying to be a better person and I truly value your opinion.	I thought we were cool. We are, but the past still happened. I was just explaining how you've shown your emotional side very often.	2
I said if you happen to one day end up in their shoes, literally, you would know have more power to demand empathy FROM THEM. (see what I'm saying?)	You just disputed which put you on the opposite side. I guess i read it wrong the 1st time.	2
oh no. :/ that sucks. it would have been cooler to know so you'd be prepared. :/	"Lol you say it like your gonna miss it or something. When it happens, a big heart isn't gonna float up in the air and start saying ""catch me! catch me!"". True love comes out during the relationship."	2
In Britain It used to. Before we had separation of church and state homosexuality was illegal.	The concept of fertility rate is well known and understood. It was necessary to promote it until the U.S. showed the world that all you have to do is give illegal immigrants amnesty ;)	2
I highly doubt I am dude.  	"I like how you say ""highly doubt"", as if there is a possibility that you may actually be him."	2
No more so than the rest of us. That was the great problem our Founding Fathers struggled with. They knew you couldn't trust the people and you couldn't trust the leaders but more importantly they knew they couldn't trust themselves. And that's our down fall today, we have way to much self esteem. Pride is deadly and if we're going restore this once great nation we need to restore the understanding of human nature our Founding Fathers had. We need to see ourselves as we really are, croocked to the core but with a nice veneer so people will like us.	I thought the nice veneer was so that people would stroke us ;)	2
Erm, I don't know of any shopping trolleys big enough to kill 5 children. I just got the semantics from wikipedia, so meh.	You did say it was going pretty fast. Anyway what you're talking about is called a tram.	2
I think your brother was talking about a different type of pussy dude.	Probably... I dunno. Cuz I've never eaten any of those........................................................................!	2
Now you're just being stupid.	Time is not prerequisite of gravity nor space.-----------------------------------	2
Haha I need to try that.  500000000000000000000000000000000000000000	Want to know a 50 character limit trick?	2
Because it's so easy to come by, it's odd that curiosity wouldn't bring you to it.  And most people are never introduced. Or anything.	Plus I don't want to develop a dirty mind looool but seriously	2

I've never let it get to me, I suppose I've never had anything to compare it to. But at Christmas the whole family gets together for a meal, we rarely do that for people's birthdays.	That's nice for now. But I'd imagine when you're older and want to celebrate your birthday with friends it will become a little more difficult... I could be wrong though. To each their own.	2
I'm just going to say this: watch out for equivocation.	Sometimes I wish having multiple usage definitions for a single word was outlawed. lol	2
God, I wish I was a red head! I've always been jealous of them and they are hot. And I am actually a twin but sadly my twin is a he. And the idea of doing anything with him disgusts me.  Lol, I'd never lie to you.	Well...., the thing with being a red head is that the carpet needs to match the drapes, otherwise the authenticity is questionable ;)	2
Whichever country starts WWIII will end the world ( for humans ). This is common knowledge. You would truly have to have a maniac suicidal leader to start another WW. If you know that walking down that hall way will result in death would you walk down that hall way? Would anyone?	Any country that starts World War Three will not end the world for us but it will end our global civilization. Surely there must be someone who have survived World War Three if there is any.	2
"Or perhaps, slavery just really works. :D Just because people didn't have the technology to do incredible things like build pyramids doesn't mean they didn't have the skill and manpower. You look at the great statues and feel awed because in our comfortable, labor-free lifestyles, we've forgotten that we used to fight to live, had to really work to survive (well, everybody apart from royals anyways). And plus, why would aliens help us? We'd only become competitors in space colonisation or their farm animals, depending on how advanced they are. ""Deity myths were observations of alien astronauts"" Or the result of some heavy narcotic use and creativity. ""Mythical creatures were observations of genetic experiments by aliens"" Natural mutations of animals/humans. ""Texts from ancient civilizations point out the destruction of even more ancient civilizations by hands of the 'Gods' via energy weapons and bombs"" Meteorites? Again, maybe some really cool storytelling?"	If you don't agree with the theory, I believe you should be on the bullsh*t side. :D	2
I believe that social networking sites have their place in work, play, study and war! The question is, does the individual know how to use the social networking tool to their advantage in each of these situations? I suspect the answer is no!	I totally agree, social networking sites are great! However what most students lack are appropriate way of using them and time management.	2
Yeah, the fact she switches sides means she's not just stuck in one train of thought. In fact, I respect Ismaila more than most people I meet BECAUSE of how wishy washy she is. Even if she hates me, and even if I hated her back (I don't), but even if I did, I'd still have to respect her because she's not just some complacent fool who accepts what they're told.	lol! The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.	2
First off you have to define what's a religion. A religion is man's way to get to god. Atheism is a belief that there is no god so it is not technically a religion since they don't believe in a god.	Yes, atheism is more of a philosophy of not believing in gods. Why you don't believe in gods differs among atheists. Some are angry at their religion, some don't care, some are into science and philosophy and have figured gods probably don't exist, and some are never introduced to religion at all.	2
Hey, you said I was only posting uberHumor crap so I figured I would branch out. Now you're bitching about that ;)	That's just how I roll.	2
Guys, this is a good idea. My developer is no longer MIA, but is daughter is really sick so he hasn't been able to help at all. I am transitioning day to day development to a set of offshore resources (over a 90% discount from going rates), but this will take a while. I will do my best to get something put in place, the balance is that educators use the site and they have students vote from day one. But, I have an idea to fix that too! Just give me a few more weeks. Thanks, Andy	Thanks Andy, Im sure you will do your best, I really enjoy this site and would hate to see it overrun by trolls.	2
Who do you think? Here's a hint. Nothing has changed with the troll.	Ah I see. I think you are right lol .	2
Look at me dead in the face and tell me you wouldn't prefer dragging your balls through STD infested broken glass versus watching My Little Pony.	I wouldn't do ether. I am neutral on those options.  	2
Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	You do know Allah is your god or are you still sadly denying it? Also believing in actual historical figures mean you burn in hell? If so wow your god must only want idiots in heaven which I suppose makes sense.	2
Ave, I think you misunderstand me. I agree with you, the supernatural is unreasonable. All of religion is unreasonable. Ok I agree. Ok The guess I was referring to was the guess theists make. They could be right as likely as people who think unicorns are real, could be right, but either way in the end it was all a guess. Then specify that is all. Dont make it seem like humanity as a whole make that guess. I was giving an example of what a reasonable religion could look like. But the problem is, as soon as you explain the supernatural scientifically it ceases to be supernatural and thus becomes natural. This would then make the religion containing it no longer a religion. I agree. The only thing we might disagree on which was the main point of my post was that if a religion could prove itself scientifically somehow (which I highly doubt), then THAT would be a reasonable religion at least as far as in it being a rational thing to acknowledge as true. Religion and spirituality is BS. you remember me don't you, I'm one of the biggest atheists on here. Okay but again once it becomes explained by science it wouldnt be a religion anymore but an accepted scientific theory. A reasonable religion literally cannot exist.	 Then specify that is all. Dont make it seem like humanity as a whole make that guess. I thought I did but I guess I didn't. I'll try to be clearer next time, my apologies.  But the problem is, as soon as you explain the supernatural scientifically it ceases to be supernatural and thus becomes natural. This would then make the religion containing it no longer a religion. kay but again once it becomes explained by science it wouldnt be a religion anymore but an accepted scientific theory. A reasonable religion literally cannot exist.  That's another way to look at it, and it makes sense because all religion we ever had has always seemed to based on practical myth. I wonder though if you proved a random religion scientifically, let's say Christianity (though I wouldn't even bet a penny on it), would Christians still refer to christianity as a religion?	2
Well, your mum is wrong!	You're wrong! D:<  	2
Sure, but that's why you'd give modship to people YOU trust, Andy (as I've said, you'd be the deciding factor in, not only whether or not it gets implemented, but who gets said modships). I can't imagine in a million years Joe, Hellno, Prayerfails ever going batshit crazy like that.	Don't get me wrong, I trust all of them...you too...but the issue is not the trust...it is the system needed to allow them to moderate and possibly over moderate but allows me to reverse anything they have done. I have an idea on how to do this, but it will be further down the list of upgrades.	2
Straight...but I am not biased or prejudiced against any sexual orientation.	Sarah Palin: hot or not? ;)	2
So, I call him gay in return, and also the freaks who support him (some of them really are gay).   troll  Someone who is purposefully posting on a forum/messageboard/site with the sole aim to irritate the regular members.	Well that has nothing to do with my message. My sole purpose was to explain why I said that Hellno and other users who had been trolling me, were gays. The reason was payback to them. It had nothing to do with my supposed hatred for gays.	2
Marijuana has a varying effect depending upon the person. For some, it impairs. For others, it boons. In both cases though, it usually relaxes. And a relaxed debater is an efficient debater. So for the most part, I'd say weed, for an intellectual, would have a positive effect.	Also, most people don't understand that there are two types of marijuana with quite different effects.  Indica is the type of marijuana typical to the media, which causes a lazy, dumbed-down effect. Sativa on the other hand boosts energy and increases creativity.  I only like to smoke sativa strains, especially in the morning. Smoking a heavy indica in the morning will ruin your productivity for the day.  I suggest sativa strains for createdebate.com users.	2
"If you really think about it the words ""diverse"" and ""community"" have a sort of oxymoronic relationship. One speaks to differences, and the other to commonalities. The lead question is just plain old illogical. It amounts to asking: ""wouldn't we be better off if we were all exactly the same?"" But to answer anyway... In some ways diversity works against community, in some ways community is strengthened by diversity. I think it's real good if people sit there and ponder ""Where should I draw the boundaries of community?"" Sure many people are still so narrow minded that ethnicity plays an over-sized part in how they define community but I think (hope) they're becoming a smaller and smaller minority."	I think (hope) they're becoming a smaller and smaller minority. Oh, so you can opress them? Hmm? ;) (I get your point, I'm just being a dick =p)	2
"Either way, I don't think he was saying that they would live for about 2000 years. It seems to me that he was implying that his second coming would occur within that century. Yeah that is what I got out of it too. And I am aware that the very next line he says that he cannot say when exactly the coming will occur. But that ""generation"" line sure does seem to narrow it down a bit. I do seem to remember a few other lines that could be interpreted that way that bugged me since I was a child, but...perhaps another day."	What gets me is that New Testament wasn't even written until after Jesus' death and all of the books were written years apart. Why include that bit if everyone that will be reading those books are from different generations?	2
Freedom of speech; if you don't like the debate topics and would prefer to see something more meaningful to you then create the debates yourself.	I agree. .	2

I do not see using the term nr for blacks is wrong. After all, blacks do it. Do you see my point?	"Gay and the N-word are very different. The N-word is from when african-americans were slaves immigrated from africa. I was a purposeful mispronounciation of the nation Niger. Gay on the otherhand, origianlly meant happy. It only recently became a term to descibe a homosexual.  You can try to make an argument that it is not ""politcally correct"" but that is not the mainstream conscious for both the straight and gay communities. I would rather not try to put a whole bunch of red tape around the word."	2
Nice point but the hunger games was a bad example as there was money in the hunger games :P	True--------------------------------------------------------------------------MOO	2
Not especially no. The only thing that mildly got me off was the fact that what was being said was not a kind thing. But really no.   We still buddies or have we any particular prejudices? I understand, bisexuals tend to be the most disliked by both sides..!	I don't care dude. You're just a username to me lol.	2
Have you reported it to Andy yet ?	I reported the question but I have not sent Andy an email yet and there are two of them out	2
Not as much as I used to since the landscape has changed for the worse.	Aw, come on. Don't budge - don't let it get worse. You can be a stronghold others use to pull back to return to the good ol' days.	2
Its Family guy robot chicken is stupid and family guy is way funnier	i agree family guy is funny, robot chicken is o.k. but family guy has a baby that want to kill his mom, thats funny. yhen you got peter, is is an idiot. lois is smart. chris is slow and meg is ugly. and when have you ever saw a talking dog.	2
every time i read the paper its a story about a criminal who has a record as long as your arm, ( never been to jail for any length of time)he has finally hurt someone real bad and gets six months. the system sucks.	I recall the case of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka. They were Canadians, did you Americans ever hear of them? Anyway, she helped her boyfriend (and later husband) rape and then, accidentally, kill her sister as well as several other women. She got, I think, about 12 years. I remember another case around my city where a man was beat, nearly to death, by a bunch of teenagers. The teenagers were, for the most part, released - as I recall, of course. I never followed up on the story.	2
I agree, but it shouldn't be based on the amount of points people have (for example, Dana/Sitara has the third most on the site, and she doesn't deserve any sort of modship), but people like Joe, Hellno, Prayerfails (those who are quite respected) should get such a position, that is if Andy decides to implement the idea, as he is ultimately the deciding factor on such an important position.	I understand. I haven't been here to for too long so I am not aware of the systematics of this site. I should leave the decision making to you all.	2
I rate this as third class rape (assuming there are three classes such as is present in murder).	I am ignorant. Please tell if you can by what you mean by third class? :) I think i understand you but i am not sure.	2
They know more than me! LOL ...	So, did they explain it to you? If not, I'll be happy to guide you through it. lol	2
While Christians Oppose Gay Marriage? It would really help me if you clarified what you mean by your question so I can give a proper answer, thanks.	You are a Christian Right? Christians Oppose Gay Marriage! Like in the bible it says it is a sin!	2
"List ten. Prove that infinitely many exist, please. Disprove that they don't. Provide me with evidence that we are individually programmed to do ""specific things"". Please, do so. I would love to see the response. What evidence do you have, Intangible? Oh no. A dead end. I guess that's what I get for trying to disprove the existence of emotions. Hah...;/"	Your on the positive end of this argument. It's your job to provide evidence for your case. Unless, you simply don't have any and you are drawing nearer to a last resort.  Oh no. A dead end As I expected. No evidence? Shall I cease trying to argue this portion of your argument with you? Or do you wish for me to show you why I believe emotion exists?	2
Wrong side.	I bet this is about the 10th time I did this. Sorry.. :/	2
"War is itself is an evil War does not kill evils; war is itself an evil and a mother of many other evils like massive destructions, unemployment, mental and physical diseases, poverty, economic instability, illiteracy. It has destroyed nations from the face of earth.  What is war? War is a reciprocated, armed conflict, between two or more non-congruous entities, aimed at reorganizing a subjectively designed, geo-politically desired result.  The term is also used for non-military conflict, such as in the example of cold war.  The history of man has seen these wars.Afghan war, American Civil War, World war 1, World War 2, Napoleon War, Kuwait war, Iran-Iraq war etc  In history, no war brought the wellness of human being, it pushed the society behind.  Personally I am against war as the very act of fighting among each other divides us as a race. With more divisions, and with that, more bad blood between people, misunderstandings among people of different groups, be they racial, national and religious, will increase exponentially.  The history of war is as old as human. There could be so many reasons of going war. The  Also, war takes lives. Not only of enemies also of our brothers. I hope that I will never have to see even once in my lifetime. In World War II, it is estimated that 60 to 70 Million causalities occurred. War  Not to mention, war exerts a tremendous strain on the country's economy. If you dont have a comparative advantage in making weapons, then your resources will not be used efficiently, and people in your own country are going to suffer, if not in the battlefields of soldiers, then in the battlefields of their own house, where they fight for survival from hunger.  We teach our kids that they shouldn't fight with their little friends over toys, food, etc. Instead, they should talk and reach a consensus. ""If your little friend keeps hitting you, ignore him, or talk to him, but never fight back, because then the problem will never be solved.""  We should now teach adults that war doesn't solve problems, and is bad both to winners and losers. To reply anger with anger is not intellectual.  War breeds destruction not just to mankind and infrastructure but also to the environment, from massive deforestation to air pollution.  Chemical agents pollute the sea, air and land, destroying a large number of habitats and killing off its inhabitants.  Biological weapons cause damages to large areas and it is danger enough that If go out of control can affect the population around the globe.  Yes, it is true that we have to fight to save people's life however, have you thought about the long term effects that could happen by waging war and using force to help those people?  I think war is a manly way to solve problems, but not the best way. I really don't see how it overall benefits anything.  War is a tool of illiterate and non civilized persons. Civilized nation who have understood the value of peace are progressing rapidly like European countries. It is quite evident that they are the fastest progressing countries. While in Asia where most of the third world countries exist, the main reason of their poverty is the on going conflicts among the people of countries themselves and with the neighboring countries.  Look around yourself and observe people. You will find that the person who remains angry and ever ready to go on a fight always remain surrounded by problems. All his efforts end in multiplying the problem. He causes damages not only to himself but also to his relatives and nearby people. On the other hand, a person who avoids conflicts or try to solve conflicts with in soft manner actually resolve them. This brings harmony among people.  War kills innocent people.  Wars Risk the Future of the Human Race  War is an aggression  Life is sacred.  The history of the world comprises a number of wars  In war, no one wins, both are in loss.  : war! war! Why do we have to fight? People are dieing because of the war, War is not good, absolutely nothing. Death here, death there, Parents are lost, dreams are lost, Children are lost, brightness is lost. War brings darkness, War destroys happiness, War brings GENOCIDE. War overtakes peace, And replaces it with conflict, War is not harmony. War brings greediness, War brings depression, War is not good, absolutely nothing."	Wars are almost always for the worse. They always end up in taking the lives of innocents, drains money, takes the lives of soldiers, and is essentially is an evil. Total agreement.	2
No one wants to learn about their history to be honest and I find it quite sad for those who do want to learn about it. Those people disgust me.	Wow! You are going to get some shit for this one....	2
I dont think I will ever get a tattoo. I just cant. It is kind of scary.	Yeah, and even if you want one now, you might change your mind years from now, or your body might change and distort the tattoo. Another thing is that a lower back tattoo can prevent you from getting an epidural.	2
Or he didn't have the love of dick you have? They followed him because he came to heal people physically, emotionally, and spiritually.	Or he didn't have the love of dick you have? Jesus was a lady?	2
I was almost going to say yes, but then I realized I don't live in a cave, so really, I'm not a caveman. If I was a caveman, then I have a feeling I would be in a very bad financial situation.	Lol. It means to say that they haven't really evolved. Not literal cavemen xD	2
1. Replace the global monetary system. 2. Slow down the use of fossil fuels, limited to emergency use only. 3. Invest in the exploration of space and a deeper understanding of quantum physics. 4. Covert the worlds energy usage to run on clean renewable energy.	Just wait until Jesus comes back seems like a far easier solution to the problem.	2
Yes. Zimmerman followed him even though he was told to stay in the car. If some stranger stalked me like that, they would be as dead as a doornail. I am on Trayvon's side, and before you downvote me, know that I give not one single fuck what you think. Smooches!	Are you aware that when they told him not to get out of the car, he was already out of the car? I'm not saying it makes a difference, just most people don't seem to know that.	2
But wouldn't gay and lesbian just fall under homosexual? o.o	Yes but still.  A homosexual is a person who sexually and emotionally favors the opposite sex. You can say a woman is homosexual. You cannot say a woman is gay, nor can you say a man is a lesbian.	2
All you have to do is use fire fox and accept when it asks you to install the player or go to the flash web site and start the process of installing from there. Then, half way through the process you're supposed to bang your head on the keyboard, much like my picture/avatar/icon on the right.... over there ---> ;)	You know I actually got so mad at my library's computer (it runs on microsoft) that i started banding my head against the keyboard (much like your icon but i didn't crack it open) and now i have lost all computer privliges while in there for this semester. ;D	2
It isn't Prod. Its my brothers hulkbusters who is doing this.	OK, I take your word for it and retract my earlier suspicions.	2
It's actually pretty simple. You can attack flaws and specifics within the texts and practices of a religion, but ultimately an individuals faith is his or her own. If you attack a specific passage that that individual happens to see as a metaphor, you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. If you do the same to a religious individual who concedes that there may be inaccuracies in the text due to oral tradition, translation and re-translation, again you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. Attacking the general flaws of religious texts is pretty much pointless because of that- it MIGHT be useful in the odd case of the individual believer who considers the entirety of the writings to be both literal and infallible, but those individuals tend to be particularly inflexible in their beliefs and fairly close minded to facts even if placed right in front of them.	It's actually pretty simple. You can attack flaws and specifics within the texts and practices of a religion, but ultimately an individuals faith is his or her own I agree and this was exactly be my argument against him, religions as a whole and in general can have flaws, and you can point them out. It is important to understand their being different interpretations, however you can still point out flaws in certain religions. It is relevant, because the pros and cons of a religion as a whole will effect the individual.  If you attack a specific passage that that individual happens to see as a metaphor, you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. If you do the same to a religious individual who concedes that there may be inaccuracies in the text due to oral tradition, translation and re-translation, again you pretty much don't have anything to attack insofar as that individual is concerned. Then im pointing out flaws of a religion that may or may not apply to the next person whom believes in it. I don't see why I can't do that. Attacking the general flaws of religious texts is pretty much pointless because of that- it MIGHT be useful in the odd case of the individual believer who considers the entirety of the writings to be both literal and infallible, but those individuals tend to be particularly inflexible in their beliefs and fairly close minded to facts even if placed right in front of them. I agree however, if we completely stop criticising these beliefs however then no progress will be made and the ignorant and closeminded will never deteriorate over time.	2
You stop telling people to get their dick cut off and I will start reading first.	I never did, you did. Jesus never preached that for the gentiles, and that's what we are.	2
I mean where else would that come from uhm... let me think. Maybe she IS a bitch :) Bitches bitch. So you have in your wording told us already that you think girls are bitchy on their period.  No I didn't say that in my own words. That was your interpretation of what I said :) Don't become a lawyer. I would say that to you too, since you take interpretations as evidence.	"No I was referring to your word use. If you presented the sentence:  ""If guys bled from their penis once a month, wouldn't they be bitching about it t"" in a tribunal, the defense would then pick apart the words you have used and turn them against you, because you haven't worded it very well. And you haven't. Your 'guys bleeding from penises once a month' thing is a parallel of a woman's period So obviously there will be comparisons involved. I don't want to be a lawyer I wouldn't be very good at it, I stutter too much :P"	2
I think the original Illuminati vanished back when history supposes. The Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO claim to have their roots with the original group but I highly doubt it. That was more of a marketing ploy to get more members. Any modern Illuminati type group is a farce with little relevance to the original organization.	"That's basically what I told Srom. He replied with ""Yeah sure... that's why they still exist"". Ah, whatever. My attempts to try and increase Srom's knowledge almost always fail lol."	2
Why are we all sinners? Adam and Eve ate the fruit, we were just born of them, without choosing to be.	Since we are talking about the Bible here, yes. As for you yourself, you may be an average person, but it is likely you have done something wrong at least once in your life.  And to what you said, yes. That is confirmed in the Bible.	2
That was a pretty good one  	Midget fortune teller escapes prison: small medium at large!	2
I'm trying really hard to understand what you say. What qualities of someone are 'reasonably essential' and what are the 'ordinary' boundaries of them that you're talking about?  Why would you define yourself as 'a complex of interactions'?  (Note: you don't mean 'literally' extending. To someone to literally extend themselves it would mean like Mister Fantastic).	(Note: you don't mean 'literally' extending. To someone to literally extend themselves it would mean like Mister Fantastic). Good point. You literally made my head explode.	2
Yes we do. We are dumbing down children. They are not reaching their full potential because politicians do not have the balls to demand a better education. I know this because I am an American. I experienced the American public school system. Science has proven that the earlier you start foreign languages, the better. Fetuses start retaining language around 30 weeks maybe. If I had children, I would rather have them attend an Iraqi public school than an American one. At least the Iraqis teach their children what they need to know.	"I know this experience firsthand. not only do students not get as good of an education, as you say, but teachers of children as young as Elementary/Preschool age will honestly hold children back from their full potential. When parents ask if their children can have any enrichment opportunities, the teachers will often say ""all parents think that their child is special, your child isn't, either."" In this way, nobody gets ahead. Nobody feels insignificant for not doing as well in school. My first grade teacher did this, and now my younger brother (third grade) is being applauded for his skills, though he is purposely below average. He will hardly ever read, and when he does it is nine times out of ten a school assignment. If we had foreign language classes from a young age, it might not change that, but at least a few more students might actually try in school. Other countries often require English classes, and foreign speakers generally have better English grammar in my experience. What's the difference? They are not held back. There is a push to learn and do well in school."	2
You mean Berkeley? No. But I'm from the Bay Area, and I live in Southern California.	Is it just me or do tons of people from Norcal go to UCLA and tons of people from Socal go to Berkeley.	2
None of the smokers I know are apathetic airheads. We're all quite motivated on the frontier of marijuana legalization.	Seriously! More than half of the marijuana smokers I know are highly philosophical, highly motivated people; and, if you were wondering, California is considering legalizing for economic reasons. And, when it comes down to it, it’s so easy to get marijuana, it might as well be legal. Like sex or alcohol/cigarettes for minors, marijuana is so easy to get, the government would be better off legalizing to regulate and protect.	2

(your argument is soo lonely.) i agree with you completely(~) this is something that realy should be done, though i feel that this maybe should be done in conjuntion to a portion size as well. if you only have 4 fries it isn't bad for you. etc. the only problem i see is, where do you drawl the line for what is fast food and what isn't. at mcdonalds you get attrocious food fast, while at subway,pollo tropical, and miami subs, the food is of a better quality, but how do you decide the quality, is it based on nutritional value of a certain food item. what if it is ordered with no mayo or cheese? is the price reuced? and what about non fast food, for the sake of my post, slow food restaurants. if a slow food restaurant has un healthy food do they pay the same tax? or is this just a vendeta against the poor? (whoops did i just say that) and saying that fast food and madicare correlate is bs. fast food and low education/moral/all sorts of other factors play into it. if a rich person eats mcdonalds every day and they dont have medicare do they still pay the tax? now this tax is unfare! why should i pay for the government to provide medicare by paying taxes on fast food. its a viscious cicrle.	This is what Congress is for. I don't know. Subway is a great alternative for fast food. But it's not perfect. For instance you can get a veggie delight no mayo, or a meatball sub with two times cheese and a topping of mayo. The meat is probably cheap and full of fat as cheap factory farmed meat is. I'm not sure though. And you can get a side salad at Carls Junior. But you also get a huge bag or crutons and a big pouch of dressingcoughmayocough. So I mean I guess it can't be done. But I wish it could. If someone could work out the kinks, it would be nice... but complicated. Slow food restaurants can be packed with sodium and other bad things. They're not always better. Fast food and low education/moral/all sorts of other factors play into it. if a rich person eats mcdonalds every day and they dont have medicare do they still pay the tax? now this tax is unfare! why should i pay for the government to provide medicare by paying taxes on fast food. Well yes. Everyone should pay taxes for medicare. Even people who never use it. We support each other as fellow citizens. But the fact that low income families are drawing so much from medicare for reasons that can be prevented, I feel is wrong. So it's essentially the same as a cigarette tax.	2
The owner should give you or someone with a multitude of points moderater abilities. It only seems fair.	I agree, but it shouldn't be based on the amount of points people have (for example, Dana/Sitara has the third most on the site, and she doesn't deserve any sort of modship), but people like Joe, Hellno, Prayerfails (those who are quite respected) should get such a position, that is if Andy decides to implement the idea, as he is ultimately the deciding factor on such an important position.	2

To be honest I'd rather see marriage abolished than divorce disallowed.	"...As far as government involvement in marriage is concerned? I'd be inclined to agree, although I must admit marriage is a convenient way to settle ""who gets what"" upon a person's death if they neglect to write a will."	2
"In Switzerland, there is no standing army. Instead they have a peoples militia. Every suitable male over the age of 18 is required to serve in the military. They receive an initial basic training and are later required to attend a yearly refresher course.  Each member is required, by law, to own and manage government issued weapons specific to the job that person was assigned. Until 2007 they were required to keep ammunition for said weapons as well.  The reason this structure works is because the Swiss army does not take part in armed conflicts in other countries, no ""if""s ""and""s or ""but""s."	" The reason this structure works is because the Swiss army does not take part in armed conflicts in other countries, no ""if""s ""and""s or ""but""s. I dont think them not entering wars is because of their militia but because the officials that run the country dont want any trouble."	2

Some may even want 12 year old girls which is just fucked up You sound as though you work for Fox News.	Yeah pretty much. What defines masculinity?  Masculinity: pertaining to or characteristic of a man or men: masculine attire.  2. having qualities traditionally ascribed to men, as strength and boldness.  Neither of which are exhibited in the show MLP. Therfore, suggesting the lack of masculinity.  And i just made a simple inference: They like a 12 yo girls show = they MIGHT like 12 yo girlds	2

"I see.  Taking credit out of the equation, spending is helpful to any economy in terms of overall quality of life and in terms of advancement.  It's sort of self-evident I think, but when most people are spending less individually there is less incentive to create, thus less need to employ, thus less people with money, thus less spending, thus less incentive to create... and on and on. With more spending the opposite is true, again, most reasonable people can see this is the case without much explanation. The problem is when the complexity of how money is spent, and where that money is really coming from is overlooked. It is complex. This also requires massive action. A few spending money is not helpful (unless wealth is incredibly concentrated, <a href='http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/financial-wealth-united-states.png'>which we're definitely trending toward and even then, a limited number of people buying does not create incentive for massive job creation).  There is a recent example of this in the Bush tax cuts. It resulted in approximately $100 real extra money for the vast majority of people, then at the upper ends $100,000 plus. This did not ""save the economy"" obviously because that $100 was a small portion of indebted money (on average people still owed more than $100) for the masses who ideally would have been required to spend to begin this process, and at the top end, there was no incentive to invest that money in anything that created jobs, because the masses still don't actually have money to spend. Worse, the vast majority of that cut still makes its way to those who received the lion's share of that tax cut in the form of paying of debts and interest, it just took a little longer to get there than with the straight tax cut received.  So spending is good, even necessary, but only when you actually have the money to spend, and when it can be spent in addition to other things already bought. It does not work if it is swallowed by paying more for things people already have or already need to spend on because that eliminates the incentive to ""create."""	"Wow, you are one of the scariest debaters on here. I literally fear a response from you at the risk of being served. I read all of this and the ending summary really helped. I agree that everyone spending will help the economy, only if there is money to be spent. Which is where, I guess the question comes up, ""Who starts the cycle? The business owners or the people."""	2

AHA! AND THAT IS WHERE I HAVE YOU! I have a perfect, err, well, Near Perfect design for the utmost safety of the item in question.

The Legal part, actually, might be the hardest part, especially with the more Liberal parties. It all kinda depends on how well I can convince you of all people with my claims of absolute safety right on the face of it.

I have played Roblox before its basically a game where you make a place, and you can make anything from this place and people can come and visit your game. Every time when someone visits your place you get 1 ticket and tickets can be used to purchase clothing on that site. You start off when you make your account with 10 tickets and you get 10 tickets every time you login to Roblox Its a free to play game, but there is options to join Builders Club which is a thing where you can get more places and get Robux which is basically like money, and you can purchase things like gear which can be unique sword, or items that can be played it some games if they allow it.	I could have a bias for Minecraft, but that sounds awful. Are there any mods, or people making custom maps, or mini-games. Can you make a working virtual computation device in Roblox?  In Minecraft people create visual art, recreations of places real or imagined. Also people who make songs out of note blocks are amazing. I know I'm biased as all hell, and am too lazy to do research, because this debate is just asking what we play I don't have to prove anything. It's just my opinion. Is Roblox worth looking into?	2

Evolution has a substantial scientific consensus. Scientists from many, many different fields have contributed to evolution in an effort to prove it's validity. They have succeeded, though there are doubters. Evolution asserts that one creature, over time, becomes a superior creature, different in many regards to it's progenitor.  Radiometric age dating has confirmed that the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years. This has been confirmed from meteorite material. 3.5 billion years ago, unicellular life evolved; it took nearly three billion years for multicellular life to become commonplace. Fifty million years later, extremely basic forms of ocean life develop, and after another fifty million years they move onto land. By 250 million years ago, reptilian life becomes commonplace - the most famous of which are the dinosaurs; fortunately for humans, they go extinct over the next millions of years. Four million years ago, an Ice Age killed of most of the larger mammals. Many now-extinct creatures thrived during the Pleistocene era - 2.5 million to 12 thousand years ago - including, perhaps most noticeably, the Woolly Mammoth and the sabre-toothed tiger. Homo Erectus also evolved during that time period, roughly 1.8 million years ago. By 200,000 years ago, there is evidence of the existence of an archaic form of Homo Sapiens, the genus to which we belong ! Forty thousand years ago Cro-Magnon began migrating to Europe and by 25,000 years ago the Neanderthal became extinct. It was not until the last 10,000 years or so that modern Homo Sapiens developed.	I must give credit where credit is due. Most anti-evolutionists don't understand evolution competently enough to give a convincing devil's advocate argument. So kudos to you!	2
Well, looks that way according to this. Pretty much all religion is based on pedophilia, human sacrifice, woman and child beating, murder, mahem, eating people, etc. Allah is no better or worse than God, Zeus, etc.	Athiests are obviously so much better.

I enjoyed the Olympics and also enjoyed seeing and speaking to people who by watching it have been inspired to take up sport, a healthier population is going to be better for the economy in the long run less people in hospital suffering from Obesity and other illnesses caused by a sedentary lifestyle as well as the money spent in the shops on sportswear which will actually be used for doing sport in instead of going to the local shop to buy your chocolate in and the increase in Gym memebership and sports centre useage.  Wether these increases in revenue from sport will offset the amount spent on staging the Games only time will tell	What TheAshman said is true. The Olympics are actually promoting sports in a new fashion, and of course, helping to boost camarederie and sportsmanship. This will indirectly affect our manner (positively) towards the upcoming problems too. In fact, the money spent can actually be minimised if other venues (which are already existent) is used for the event	2

You're mistaken. I posted more on the other column... but there are many cases to do with the printing pictures of people and this is included in the freedom of expression.  It could be that in Denmark it is illegal to take a picture of someone in the street with their permission. I don't know. The actually taking of the picture isn't to do with freedom of expression - just the printing of it.	If someone takes a picture of you without your permission, you can legally go ahead and smash their camera.	2

What makes you think that they are all going to hell?

Actually, a better argument is: Farm subsidies are not due to religion, race, age, gender, or sexual persuasion (this point was made iamdavidh). Marriage benefits (on the other hand) are due to sexual preference. Therefore, gays are being discriminated against.	2
lol! I already changed it before you posted....	hahah :D	2
I love BigOats even though he wants my bacon, but he knows he can't have it. No! Means No! L O V E U Oats. peace love and butternubs	"Fair warning: I might steal that ""peace love and butternubs"" line. I have been using ""nothing but love"" but it might be time to 'get with the times' as the kids say."	2
I think I may have gotten on her shit list too so you may be getting nasty replies yourself ;)	LOL! Well if nothing else our split personalities may help expedite her seeking some professional help to sort out her issues... We're actually doing a sort of public service now that I think of it:))	2
i hate him 	Did he give you a swirly or something? I hate those. He gave me one. I about drowned.	2
so you assume that if kids can't get free condoms at school, they won't get condoms at all? i remember never getting a free condom in high school, yet, i never got a girl pregnant in school. hmm, maybe that's cause i did what everyone else was doing and just bought them.	I agree Pyggy...I am of the age group who remembers the guys buying them.....very embarrassed and red-faced but bought nonetheless!	2
"1. I don't say that it's wrong but here's the problem as I see it. let's say the fourth person brought in is already married to SIX others.  2. See above. If one people has a right to two spuses of their choice so does everyone else and it might not be the ones they are already married to.  Imagine the domestic disputes on the future ""Cops"" episodes. Grab some popcorn!"	"1. I don't say that it's wrong but here's the problem as I see it. let's say the fourth person brought in is already married to SIX others.  Yeah? So ? You need to explain what you think is wrong with that, or whatever you think if you don't think it's wrong 2. See above. If one people has a right to two spuses of their choice so does everyone else and it might not be the ones they are already married to. Imagine the domestic disputes on the future ""Cops"" episodes. Grab some popcorn! Not sure I understand you, and not sure you understood me there. I'll try to explain: Let's say you and me are married. I can not be married to you, unless you are married to me too, right? If we were married, we were married to each other. Let's take that into a number of three. Let's say, you, Dana and me were married. Let's say the law said, that polygamy is allowed if everyone is married with everyone. That would mean, I am married to you and Dana, Dana is married to you and me, and you are married to me and Dana. Understand? Everyone is married to everyone. It would not be like... I am married to you, and then I have three other spouses, that you don't have. Do I explain myself better? And what do you think of that?"	2
I love my Pepsi, it's my addiction and won't give it up either.	I am trying to drink less cola... but it's not working!!!!	2
Well you guys are lucky. While you were debating I just was told that I was no longer a sister to Abby. Out of her mouth she told me not to address her as as sister. This is no longer a fight on drama. It is no use. Just leave it :'(	Does your sister live with you? Plus that is just really wrong what she said.	2
Okay listen, from now on I will not abuse the down voting option. I am going to tone the down voting way down. Not completely, but I will no longer abuse it.  I would like to publicly apologize for my actions. I messed up, and I am sorry.	Don't worry. I wish everyone would stop down voting in general unless the post is troll like.	2
I see what you mean. I know first hand how irrational she can be.	I'm om the fence of whether she's serious about it or just a troll. She could be a bit of both for all I know.	2
That's just a conspiracy theory . You have no proof.	My proof is that I have never seen him surfing. How can he have been borm in Hawaii if he don't surf?	2
It depends. When did she cheat? Ten years ago, or last night? How long - was it a one night stand, or months or even years-long? Was she drunk or under the influence of drugs? Did we argue, with me giving her reasons to think that it was 'over'? Under those circumstances, I may continue it.	4 - if we argued and I gave her reason to believe it was 'over' then I wouldn't hold it against her. Relationship can definitely continue if possible.	2
So there is meaning to life? No love, no hate, nothing? Emotions are meaningless?	No, I didn't say all that... Live your life the best way you can but there is no overall meaning to it.. Is there a meaning of life for a mosquito? No. But that mosquito should live his life to the fullest... zipping around and sucking blood from anything you can... Hell. maybe that is it's meaning of life? This shit is all very vague and can't be proven anyway.	2
Of cours not .. And I'm agreeing of the outfut but I'm talking about the makeup that its not using for a school day.	Yes, and I'm saying that make-up can be a part of your outfit. Like socks - for some, not wearing make-up is like walking around naked, they feel uncomfortable without make-up, and no one should deny someone the right to wear make-up, just as no one should deny someone the right to wear clothes.	2
yes and no but women do use feminism as an excuse to be sexist against men	Men suck, admit it. 	2
Spain i bet!! ;)	very funny mithoo. :P	2
In a textbook .	which text book? 	2
Yes because, if there is no way to observe it, then it doesn't exist. If it does exist then there must be some way to observe it.	Exactly if it can't be proven that it is real then you must automatically go to its not real.	2
Of cource it is! Yet let's not forget that they have done greater. Does anyone remember Echoes? Or how about Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun?	How about Atom Heart Mother? Wish you were here? Animals!	2
My big issue with quantum physics is the uncertanty principle, that there is a random on a massive and minute scale. What a load of crap. We as mathematicians, now that we understand the basics of mathematics, need to experiment with breaking the axioms we've held sacred. I believe therein holds the answer to our uncertanty.	My big issue with quantum physics is the uncertanty principle, that there is a random on a massive and minute scale. What a load of crap. We as mathematicians, now that we understand the basics of mathematics, need to experiment with breaking the axioms we've held sacred. I believe therein holds the answer to our uncertanty.  Local hidden variable hypotheses have been disproven. Further it makes sense if you accept that the very small is made up of waves, therefore you cannot observe the wave without having made it change form. It also fits in with macro-world physics because the very large is filled with so many quantum states that the results average must out into uniform behaviours. Not to mention quantum tunneling which as I understand it is responsible for a measurably higher level of solar radiation than ought to be possible if particles behaved as predictably as their macro-world counterparts.	2
Such as..... ?	Do you not understand what the commodity based system is?	2
"The first sentence says ""everyone"" but the second sentence says ""a godless congregation."" A godless congregation is not ""everyone."" It really only sounds like it is excluding God, and He ain't a person. ;) I just think if someone is going to start a new church with the motto ""live better, help often, wonder more"" whose goal is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"", then saying things that make people feel excluded is unwise and makes me question their motives. If I'm questioning their motives and I'm an atheist, I can't imagine how distrustful a theist would be of them. What are they supposed to say? ""A congregation that isn't centered around God""?"	"It really only sounds like it is excluding God, and He ain't a person. ;) Haha, good point. What are they supposed to say? ""A congregation that isn't centered around God""? Just something neutral like ""a congregation of people who want to improve our communities."""	2
"The question was regarding the capacity for judgment of groups vs individuals - which I read as the ability to make smart, humane choices. Not to simply perform work of some kind.  That reminds me of another debate elsewhere, in which offshore outsourcing was praised for it's salutary effect on an abstract entity known as, ""the economy."" My question, then as now, is: what about the human cost? The Nazis were infamous for their ""efficiency."""	One of the differences between collective judgment and that of an individual is that the collective decision need not reflect a single cohesive metric. Angels will make decisions based on what is important to angels and devils will make decisions based on what is important to devils. Dictating a metric is equivalent to dictating an outcome.	2
HELL YEAH this website is super fucking racist. Oh so now white people arent allowed to use this site because its BLACKPEOPLE meet.com Not Whitepeoplemeet.com So Shut the fuck up you racist bastards,This is racist.	I looked for a white only website to meet only whites, there is NONE.	2
This is where we will split... I don't believe there is a meaning to life.. we have no souls, we just are.	So there is meaning to life? No love, no hate, nothing? Emotions are meaningless?	2
It means your a rational, logical, and intelligent human being. Questioning things is vital to human intelligence, it keeps us skeptical and safe from untruth. Keep asking them, and if they cannot be answered, what does that say about your god?	Thank you. I still love God, but I do not like everything He does. The existence of evil, obey Me or die, stuff like that. The thing that keeps me from being an unbeliever is the loving goodness I see in my dog's eyes, the love from my loved ones, stuff like that. That may sound weird, but that is just me. :)	2
Batman isn't that different in that fact. Without all of his technology, simple as they may be, he's no more than a talented 'martial artist' with out all of that. Fighting as a civilian, yeah he'd certainly beat Iron-man, but that's not the argument here. As for the idea of Iron-man's suit powering down, it would never happen. It's powered by a self generating element that stark made himself. Not once has Iron man's suit been completely shut down, with the exception of it freezing from going too high in the atmosphere, which is a problem that he's fixed shortly after he built the suit.	Yea I'll give him credit where credit is due.	2
I deem Islam to be more logical. Boom, I proved myself right.	Be Glad I suck with details. xD  	2
I didn't mean pictures OF you.  Pictures to help your case, or liven this place up.  Besides, if you don't want people to see pictures of you, that's easily solved by not posting pictures of yourself.	Oh... well then, why did you make this debate? I see people posting pictures every now and then to support their arguments. Then again, I haven't tried, so I don't know for a fact.	2
It saves water. If you post on the other side then you are not green you water waster ;)	I've got to agree with you on the water-saving argument.  XD	2
I can definitely tell you're a high functioning stoner due to the sheer amount of excessive grammatical mistakes. Congrats.	Excuse me, do you have any source for this, I'd like to see a source of the definition of stoner and grammatical mistakes.	2
You said it was impossible for him to be circumcised. Hmmm... How about with a Kryptonite blade?	Kryptonite makes him weak, not soft ;) Otherwise they would have put Kryptonite near him and shot him dead.	2
"if a guest in your lair annoys you treat him cruelly and without mercy or you can just tell him to leave like civilized human being. when walking in open territory bother no one . If someone bothers you ask them to stop if they do not destroy them so the message I get from these two ""morals"" is annoyance is perfect justification for murder. Wow just wow"	Aye, well it is satanism. I found it quite funny- but I don't think destroy means murder.	2
Maybe you should set it a half hour early. ;)	My dear Joe, you caught that one there. I was hoping somebody would see it!	2
I wonder if he can with the sites program , this should help us out when dealing with trolls, I send Andy a message on the subject.	I doubt he'll do anything... he said his developer was MIA and I don't think he wants to spend any money on the site right now. Jc will get tired soon enough. He always does. lol	2
France or Argentina...............................................................	sorry never wanted to dispute but these teams are out of FIFA by the way I'm supporting Spain I really hope it will win this year	2
Yes what? It was a why question, not yes or no. As for my sins, they are all finite. I don't think hell is called for, when no human has done an eternity of crimes, they've at most done a lifetime's worth.	Yes to what you said about Adam and Eve.  If we are all sinners, then we will never stop sinning, and that would be infinite.	2
Maby youll never now hahahahahahahhaha............vhfhghghghgh	My nickname isn't Eagle-Eye for nuthin'! I see everything on this site and if you've been hittin' the tequila, I'll know about it.	2
not really their are not that many gay debates and the gun debates are dying down. Gods guns and Government debates would be more accurate.	That is not necessarily true because Ismalia still tries to bring up that question from time to time.	2
Technically no. The law won't let them get married in the first place, and according to something I heard on this site about some case overturning a case that legalized abortion, abortion is soon becoming illegal.	They could be married in some states. But abortion is becoming illegal? Uh-oh!	2
I was referring to my sister Abby. I don't know how to even begin handling all that drama.	Ahh my bad, good luck with that, normally I don't all this drama bother me but for some reason it really got to me this morning so I told em both to turn it in and got a load of shit for it oh well that's life I guess	2
I try not to put on other people's shoes because I don't think that's good hygiene. ;)	Lol. I was waiting for it. I thought maybe you'd say it's rude or something. Still funny. lol.	2
Alright! Par-tay on Tuesday night then! LOL! As for stirring things up here... we'd actually some people to be here to do that. LOL	True, true. I should post the link on this other site I use to use, but really? It's full of a bunch of preteen kids. Not really the best people to debate with.	2
Lol, shall I speak from experience? Because I've actually got stories about seeing some of the parents at the strip club and then they ended up giving me more money because they didn't want me to tell anyone they were there XD	";) (this is the first time I have prefaced a post with a smiley) tell me, do like teasing men? ""Ooops...., I'm sorry. I have no idea how that button got undone. I'm soooo embarrassed!"" You know, if you take the word ""embarrassed"" and drop some letters and rearrange them a little, you end up with a bare ass (as in, ""OMG! I'm so bare ass!"") ;)"	2
Their own. Believe it or not, people don't need to believe in a deity to be good people.	"""people don't need to believe in a deity to be good people."" Very true."	2
Eggplants are neither oval-shaped like an egg, nor white. So how did it happen that these vegetables were given a name with the word egg in it? Eggplants came from Asia, and were popular in the Near East long before they reached Europe. Then, in the Middle Ages, traders brought a certain kind of eggplant to Europe, a rare white variety shaped just like a chicken egg. So the vegetable was called eggplant, and the name stuck, even when the familiar purple eggplant reached Europe years later. Eggplants were also called mad apples in some places, because people thought that eating an eggplant would make you go insane! Centuries ago, Chinese women used a dye taken from the eggplant to stain their teeth black!	Thanks. Or you could just call it by it's proper name, aubergine..!	2
I thought that was a joint ;)	Well... it's up to interpretation.	2
1. He can move much faster which means he can generate much more force behind his already powerful blows.  2. I've never seen superman punch someone through a mountain.	The speed point isn't valid; some incarnations of superman have travelled at upwards of 15x the speed of light! Instant transmission trumps that, but over the short distances in combat not by enough to matter... One incarnation of superman was able to lift 200 quintillion tons with just one arm- and he stated he could have gone higher. That's certainly sufficient force to throw someone through a mountain. Superman has also been known to survive supernovae. Supernovae! Best case scenario and being extremely fair to Goku, it'd be a stalemate!	2
dogs are pretty good too though they have good intestines i love to fry those	I agree. I get them imported from China. They also gave me a manual on how to cook it properly.	2
I reported the question but I have not sent Andy an email yet and there are two of them out	Where's the second ?	2
Look justin bieber is just a huge beep try hard !! he is a little tension seeker in every aspect	Do you know what I agree with you. you people have turned me against Justin	2
In order to be a religion there must be some kind of supernatural element to it thus making it unreasonable. So no. It's not even possible	Well if the supernatural was evident it wouldn't be unreasonable however if on the highly improbable chance that our unjustified lucky guess about the existence of the supernatural is true, the supernatural would most likely be interdimensional or beyond the universe or something like that which would require us to be highly advanced. So a reasonable religion (though incredibly unlikely) is possible.	2
agreed, just.. wow, and she's a spanish sports presenter and the girlfriend of sergio ramos (a spanish footballer)	Kunis is hot too... but the other girl has a better... well, everything from what I can see.	2
How are you so firm about it? You are not a part of the organization to make that kind of statment.  I do understand that there are chances to another attack the answer will still remain: Maybe.  Downvote.	I can be firm in my belief, doesn't mean it will happen. Certainly doesn't mean I want it to happen. Bizarre thing for you to lose points on by down-voting.	2
"Everyone has a desire to keep living. Everyone? Not true. Those whom commit/will commit suicide, no longer had/have the desire to live. Thus it is a matter of opinion.  You claim that we ought to just kill ourselves, therefore contradicting our desire to keep living. The only contradiction here, is the one which was caused by first statement of your post. And I was posting that last post to end this little thing, since the point can't really be argued any further, but some people just like to have the last word I guess. (oh, but now someones gonna think, ""looks like you're doing the same thing"", but it was obviously just to refute the lame point that the opposition was trying to make.)"	Those whom commit/will commit suicide, no longer had/have the desire to live. Why is suicide then described as the most courageous act possible? People hesitate before committing suicide.  I didn't say that people can't have contradicting desires. They do, people long for non-existence all the time. For people who commit suicide, this desire for non-attachment is stronger than their desire to live. But even if this other desire is stronger, there's still a desire to live. Do you honestly think people who commit suicide are happy? If they had no desire to live, they would be happy to kill themselves. Yet they are always unhappy. The only exception to this rule is probably those deep down in the depths of psychosis, but I don't think these cases are relevant. So no, the fact that people commit suicide does not contradict this generalization.	2
What is the debate? Do you like bacon? Or is bacon healthy? This makes no sense.	I know right!!! MWAHAHAHAHAHA. PIES ARE LIKE THE FLIES OF THE OCEAN!	2
In my opinion eating at home have much more advantages that eating out. cooking at home is much healthier than dining out. Food consumed at restaurants typically has a lot more calories and fat than food you have prepared at home. Another important benefit for any family with children. Eating at home instead of at a restaurant gives the entire family time to talk about their day. If you are constantly on the run and are always eating out – you lose that quality time to communicate with your loved ones. Cooking at home gives you a chance to connect and talk about school with your children and discuss your days events with your spouse. Eating at home is an excellent opportunity to educate your children on topics about saving money and eating healthy. Besides Another result of living a healthier lifestyle – eating at home can increase your overall energy levels. Since you are eating healthier foods, you are likely to be more active and have more energy compared with a sedentary lifestyle.	"I am absolutely agree with the comments that were posted above. I just want to add another advantages of eating at home. Here are some of them  1. Saving money 2. You know what the ingredients are 3. Healthy lifestyle 4. Education  Saving money  According to the website. The average American family saves more than 2000$ a year by simply eating and cooking at home. These money could be put on the investments and they will ""grow"" Ingredients When you cook at home, you buy ingredients by yourself, and you know how fresh and how good they might be. Of course expensive restaurants usually have fresh and good vegetables, but if you are middle-income family you do not go to fancy restraints and you just eat at fast food restaurants in which food can be cooked in harsh conditions and on bad ingredients.  Healthy lifestyle As I have mentioned before people who usually eat at home, are choosing the best ingredients for themselves. Though, it decreases the risk of getting food poisoning. In most cases homemade food is healthier and have better energy balance than the restaurant's. Education As Francis Bacon stated ""Knowledge is power."" Knowledge is not only education that we get from school but although the one that we get through experience and everyday improvement. I believe people develop their knowledge skills about cooking it has positive impact on the brain because more we learn smarter we get. To sum up I would also like to repeat the benefit that had been mentioned before and it is probably the most important one Getting closer to your family. Here are a lot of good things about eating at home."	2
"Respect can mean many things: that we allow it to be believed, that we honor it as a belief, that we honor the people, that we.... What does ""respect"" mean?

What does ""belief"" mean?"	<a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/'>http://dictionary.reference.com/ There ya go	2
Actually I think a few of them are honest... John McCain is pretty honest IMHO... AND he's hated by... well pretty much everyone, left and right. He's Republican but most really partisan GOP people hate him because sometimes he compromises... he doesn't just spout off GOP talking points. I can respect that even if I don't agree with the person most of the time.	Some are more honest than others... I still don't trust them though.	2
I think that having a lot of homework’s everyday can affect students concentrating, because the student will just want to finish all the assignments without any caring or focusing.	I do know for sure the importance of home work in our lives. Doing hw makes studying afterwards easier because you have understood everything that you should know while you are doing your hw. But in the contrary, I totally disagree with taking much hw because as we know school days are nout just hw,we have tons of other things to do such as exams,taking break,meet and talking with your family. We have 8(sometimes10)subjects to study . Teachers be mercyful on us ^^	2
adidas is greater because it lasts longer. nike shoes wear out after about 3 months but when i had adidas they lasted a year and 2 months	Personally I agree. Nike looks better, Adidas works better. Comparing Adidas to nike is like comparing BMW to Ford.	2
I know it DID happen, but did I say that it didn't happen, I said that it will never happen again.	"I know it DID happen, but did I say that it didn't happen Well, I didn't say you said it didn't happen. I said that it will never happen again. No, you didn't say ""again."" Dang, now I guess I did say you said it didn't happen. :) Oh well, I think we're on the same page anyway."	2
As far as I see it, hate the player, not the game. If paedophiles are harassing young children, then get the police to go round and throw them in jail, don't ruin the internet for the vast majority that don't want to fiddle children. Collective punishment is restricting and unfair. Misuses of the internet should be dealt with individually, not collectively.	"Sort of. Seems to me however that they have all the power then need to hunt down bad guys. FBI tracks hate groups via internet. Pedophiles are busted every day via internet. Terrorist groups communications are spied on via the internet. All perfectly legal. Why then if they already do this, already can do this, are already doing it every day, is there constantly a push to do it more? I suspect ""catching bad guys"" is a red herring. I suspect given more power in this area it would be used for something competely counter to what it was intended for. I have a recent example. The Patriot Act allowed, basically, the right to spy on citizens free for all style. Most said ""great idea! I have nothing to hide!"" when it was about terrorism. Fast forward to 2012, Florida is sues Homeland Security for their records obtained from the Patriot Act, to find out who voted for who in their voter purge scheme. I don't trust it. They have enough power as is to track criminals on the internet."	2

well the bridge to castelia had me reach an orgasm i just think most everything else is too pixelized. I guess they're better than yellow version though! your right about the metagame its smogons fault though. The new weapons brought in by gen 5 are really awesome. I find nine times out of ten my teams have at lease two or three gen 5 pokemon. I can't lie I've got a kickass OU team and call me a tool but i also rape at ubers ahaha.	Hmm, I do have an OU team. Admittedly I've only used it about 5 or 6 times, but it seems OK. I haven't played ubers since 4th gen though (but Kyurem white is tempting me). I really do prefer the lower tiers, seems fresher and less centralised, but to each his own. When I get my new DS, I might have to check out your team. See if I can remember anything OU, lol.	2

I call Photoshop on that one, pal. ;)	Don't you remember changing your picture for the cause ;)	2
The same... because they'd all be endangered and just chillin' in zoos.	Definitely true. There aren't many places in the world today that could support the larger herbivores, much less the larger carnivores. Unless we're talking an alternate history type of deal. I expect we'd see a bit more unity among human society and a generally lower level of scientific knowledge and technology; we'd most likely have remained nomadic hunter gatherers for a much longer period given the dangers of remaining in one place, between territorial species and those who, inevitably, would have adapted a taste for humans over the years. Beyond just agriculture, tribes would have needed to develop some pretty heavy weaponry before they could reliably settle in one place, and that constant foe would shape the direction that science and technology took, until we reached a point where dinosaurs were a negligible threat. That process took long enough without the dinosaurs! I imagine the words for various dinosaurs would also be quite different, maybe one or two syllables long each. And I expect we'd be very different ourselves, given that we've had relatively little selective pressure on our gene pool compared to most other species for most of history- in this scenario, dinosaurs would have provided selective pressure against the earliest directly traceable ancestors of man, which simply was not present for them at all in this timeline.	2

But, they're parts still go together...Just kidding, well I guess that is true but I'm a Christian so gay marriage seems wrong	I am just trying to clarify, do you think that you being christian is a Should be able to stop Gay people getting married?  If not I don't think you have a good argument against Gay marriage.	2
That's nice for now. But I'd imagine when you're older and want to celebrate your birthday with friends it will become a little more difficult... I could be wrong though. To each their own.	In the past I've celebrated with friends on another day, it's nice to have a birthday around that time because everyone is celebrating anyway.	2

I was using 'it' to refer to his semen. She could get the 'ingredients' to make a baby almost anywhere.

we came from the nature and we go back to nature. Thats how everything works. No human is free from this principle.

Some things they have had to explain to me, I wouldn't want to be guided through it...EWWWW. I will not say what they have told me that I have had to ask what it meant!!!	You can tell me later .	2
Muslims only? Well who in the hell is going to answer this then? There's that one chick from Saudi Arabia, Sushina or something, but that's the only one I know of?	I am sorry, but Muslims know their religion better than nonmuslims. I was not trying to be rude. :'(	2
Hehe. You know I've thought a lot about that -- whether you do more good or harm. Jury's still out. :) Feel free to post over there if you'd like. (It's not like the page could get any deader.)	It wont let me join. There's something wrong with the link. Btw, if you create a debate in the regular CD and then go to the debate you just created and click on the star (white with yellow edges) then a window pops up and you can select your site. The the star will turn totally yellow. This way people will see it on regular CD and when people post to it they will be posting on your site. Hmmm, I just checked and your site is not listed. You'll need to talk to loudacris. Cheers ;)	2
...what's the difference? Is this a bit like saying Which is better, a bird or a sparrow?	"Dictatorship is run by one person. An absolute monarchy is run by a Queen or King. There is a fine line between dictatorship and absolute monarchy in terms of their practical application, but, in theory, there is a strong distinction between the two. In an absolute monarchy, the law specifies that there is a single ruler (often, ordained by God or other deity), and that ruler is legally sovereign over the country. That is, absolute monarchy is a Legal form of government, established by laws. A dictatorship is rule by power alone. That is, the dictator has no legal claim or basis of retaining power, but rules because they have the force to do so. Also, a dictatorship does NOT have to be by one person (though it usually is). It can also be by a small group (for example, a military junta) which exercises the same rule-through-force. Thus, from a political science viewpoint, an absolute monarchy is a ""legitimate"" form of government, while a dictatorship is an ""illegitimate"" form. In practice, most people inside the country will seldom be able to tell the difference between an absolute monarch and a dictator."	2
Oh same here. It just has no door knob so we have to have a locksmith come and open it.	Is it actually locked or can you fit a screwdriver in it and pop it open... actually, now that I think about it... is it on a ground floor?	2
That was sweet. I would do the same for you. .	This is from my heart. I want you to remain intact. Block all incoming negativity.	2
Well, if we get married, don't be expecting diamonds.... that's all I can say. ;) EDIT: I was replying to you comment about beaded necklaces not this... I don't know what happened?	Honey I will not expect diamonds if you keep me happy other ways LMAO	2
"It really only sounds like it is excluding God, and He ain't a person. ;) Haha, good point. What are they supposed to say? ""A congregation that isn't centered around God""? Just something neutral like ""a congregation of people who want to improve our communities."""	"Just something neutral like ""a congregation of people who want to improve our communities."" Aww man, not community service again. Haha. Yours might work."	2
The Christian beliefs are found in the Bible. If you can't prove it from Scripture then it is a notion proposed by you and only you. Where does it say Satan tortures? Why isn't Satan being tortures himself by the nature of hell?	This is a correct viewpoint, and why I asked for evidence. You should have all you need, cartman. But while I still won't accept it, you'd at least have made your point.	2
Lol you are right, but I still have VHR's and will never get rid of them.	You will once your VHS player breaks down and you can't buy a new one...	2
Of course! At some age... I'm still waiting for someone to tell me.	I will explain it to you with full details and demonstration LOL	2
Batman and Iron Man... Well, they are both rich as hell... Batman acts all high class, whereas Iron Man has obvious flaws in character, and seems sleazy, which is cool because every man in his position would be the same way... if they didn't love themselves too much, like batman does.... Fuck vanity, fuck batman, it's all about the iron.	Some of the most well rounded and convincing arguments I've heard. It is all about the iron, fuck batman, fuck him in his bat ears.	2
The stupid fools deserved to die for bombing our blessed Pearl Harbour and invading our pet Polish friends	Don't you think America is Prodgenious? 	2
Well, thank YOU!! I just hope I haven't made an ass of myself with my sometimes less than punny <a href='http://global3.memecdn.com/Hot-air-balloon_c_92212.jpg#funny%20hot%20air%20baloon%20gif%20500x689'>hot air! :)	Definitely not. You're always hilarious! <a href='http://i.imgur.com/TFbLT.jpg'>Period.	2
What? I have no clue what you just said .	I posted my argument on the other page------------------------------------------------	2
"""That's some 007 shit"" I suppose it is insanely badass. Probably didn't feel like it though :) ""landed on pavement and lived"" Holy shit. Sounds like she'd be a vegatable from then on."	Lol, no. It was one of those they keep all secret till the end for suspense, but functionally 100 percent. Face looked kind of fucked up but fine. Every day would be a party for me after that though	2
This little piggy went to market, This little piggy stayed home, This little piggy had roast beef, This little piggy had none, And this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way home. Gotz it?	And this is a debate, how?	2
I believe we all need an outlet. I need decompression time. Time to chill, veg, Or whatever you want to call it. I just need time to mentally check out of work and check into reality.	Yes, I agree. I think you worded what I was trying to say better. =)	2
Don't forget that this is Activison's version of the Walking Dead, the one that focuses around all of the capping zombies, not the episodes. I should probably have made that more clear above.	I actually have to disagree with you on hoe Activation only cares about capping zombies. The only episode that isn't out yet is the last one and so far they've done a pretty good job with the story line and choice you have to make.	2
You got a little crush on Barry? Huh?	<a href='http://www.b3tards.com/u/420c52b7900bd7084f02/obama-sexy-70s-pose.jpg'>http://www.b3tards.com/u/420c52b7900bd7084f02/obama-sexy-70s-pose.jpg 	2
Well, it's your girlfriend that causes all the drama.	Yup! She's the Mama of the CD Drama! Does she get a CD tee shirt for dat? LOL	2
I'll be 17 in 10 days. Didn't Intangible post his real life picture as his profile pic before?	He posted a picture... but it was fake. He's fat!	2
This site is a constant reminder that human intelligence cannot be changed. I've been here for over 3 years (or so) and I have yet to see anyone change anybody's mind on anything that matters ;)	Humans rarely change, and this site will remind those that we don't. People can't changed people.	2
Wedwjednjwdw and all his buddies :P  Seriously show me one person who likes him, besides his schizophrenic alter-ego's...	Srom oh wait you said no alter-ego's 	2
Check it out ;)	OMG, I guess it's true!! Be careful what you ask for:)) .	2
Yep, you're Prodigee alright. ;)	"I don't understand ""Prodigee"". From other random post I have the thought that ""Prodigee"" is the name of a person who was/is a member on this website.  If this is true; I am not this person.  I just joined this website a few days ago. I was told by my doctor that a putting my thoughts into a formal logical structure, or debate format, it would help me to communicate with others.  If I am incorrect in my thought that a ""Prodigee"" is a person; I would appreciate it if you told me the definition of a ""Prodigee""."	2
so i have to get into a relationship with as many people as possible to find out. Just get into a relationship with people that you want to be with.  what if i don't WANT to Then don't get into a relationship. o.o  .	but then, how will i find out? and how am i supposed to be sure the people i like are the TRUE LOVE thing?  P.S. you sound like some love guru :P lol	2
Wait... I just noticed that I posted on the wrong side.  I don't care if you change man. Your arguments are almost always entertaining to read.	That's why I'm here, to amuse you .	2
What do u think the next logical step would be for the American people?	There would be a different thing about what logical step you were talking about. Habeas corpus is logical, but then, it is somehow a violation of what other people want. People should be able to appear before a judge, so that they will be tried and tested, in a more humane way. I think people deserve to have their pleas listened to even if it is irrational. Then after that, just let the judge and the council do their work. I think, that would be logical.	2
It is extremely weird - we don't understand it in any way, or do we? Not really. And that is why whatever position you take (theism or atheism), it's always better to have an agnostic belief. Yes there was a sheep right?! A sheep has a conscious, and its mind was just as healthy as anyone else. Creating life isn't particularly difficult anymore, is my only point. But yes, I'll let you decide how much you agree in your own time.	Yes, I am in fact an agnostic christian :p And just so you don't think I'm stupid - I know sheep has a conscious ;)	2
You can tell you haven't been in many fights. 'Out thinking' isn't really an option. Its not a game of chess :P	LOL, to an extent, but I agree with you mostly, you also need some physical ability and training. Lots and lots of training make for a good fighter.	2
it's werewolves because vampires don't exist. All those vampires are just emo fags who love fruit punch.	Werevolves could be the reason, it would explain a lot because there is never any evidence.	2
Why wouldn't God consider... hmm... I dunno... LOWER FERTILITY RATES.	"Why wouldn't God consider... hmm... I dunno... LOWER FERTILITY RATES. To bring God into this is to assume that the design is supposed to be perfect, once again, intelligent does not mean perfect. Who is to say that it was a ""God"" who designed it? It could very well have been a fallible being with the potential to create things and there could be more than one of them.  It could have been a group project between highly intelligent beings."	2
Its literally the exact opposite...whoever made this poster is a dumbass and probably an angry theist who knows absolutely nothing about atheism	I'm actually an agnostic leaning more towards atheism and in my description I posted my reason for creating this debate.	2
Yeah... well I changed my mind. He's just a troll now and not the good kind.	Oh haha ok.	2
The best style of debate is the one where you piss the other person off so much that they can't continue ;)	Definitely for/against, but this is just my perspective .	2
Dude you should look at how many hostiles I have and also Hellno. We have a bunch!	Hey, Happy Birthday! You're 1000 days old on this site.	2
I'll take it. I 100% agree with and applaud your statement. :)	Glad you agree. .	2
I now realize that i am starting to like my soon to be step dad better than my mom. I hope that if my mom doesn't misunderstand if she finds out.	Some people are just more likable than others. Your mother is family and you should treat her as such, but whether or not you like someone is up to you.	2
Enlighten me, optimist, as to where the good is in the following scenario: An enraged lesbian gorilla has broken into your house and starts violently face-sitting you and you begin to almost suffocate bar the few times when your nostrils are free to breathe. Then when you've finished licking her out and she squirts into your mouth a male gorilla comes in and rips the head of all your family by slowly plucking at it and you hear their spine snap, disc by disc until their entire neck-spine has been torn ont he inside and finally the entire head is ripped as they scream with their decapitated voice-box. Then the gorillas hump one another and pull out the nukes that they'd left outside and blow your whole city up but somehow you survive as a trapped ghost there for all eternity and beyond. P.S. You felt every bit of you blowing up beforehand.	Well I would be happy that they got to do what they wanted. I probably should have chosen a better area to live in because I wouldve had no guess that a gorilla would break in. So that would be my fault. If I were a ghost I could explore things and study the stars further so I guess I would just be a lucky astronomer. Also if I felt every bit of the blast I would be the only person to truly know. So when more humans evolve over millions of years I will tell them all I know and become the ruler of that planet.	2
Yes it does especially when there is a lot of drama going on!	Drama, on CD?!?! Surely you jest? But jest in case you're not, you might be onto something:)	2
Not all Muslim women are happy, just like not all Christian, Hindu, Mormon, atheist or Jew women are happy. In general though, having Islam as a religion does not determine their happiness because they're either used to the religion or chose to embrace it. There's nothing particularly different about Islamic women when compared to other women; they just wear hijabs, fast during Ramadan, and pray five times a day. It's not fair to make a generalization as religion making them unhappy.	For many foreigners it looks strange and violation of human rights, because they do not understand Islamic culture as muslims cannot accept their culture and views. Really there is no problem as it is promoted despite of stereotypes about muslims. It seems inequal because of different cultures, but nobody can press own standards.	2
Correct, many woman use it as a type of bleaching agent for blood stains due to that property. In fact it works very well. However, commercialized bleach is a chlorine compound not a water and oxygen compound. There is a difference. Especially, due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide is a medicinal agent that your body produces to fight off infections and sickness already. Bleach merely poisons you.	H2O2 isn't that drinkable either. I got some on my finger once. :(	2
"How often? Really? Because unless you're doing them all the time, there are a million people who need real, tangible ""Christian"" help, rather than the few people on this website who have no interest in being converted to a religion, of which we have seen so many negative effects. ""Love thy neighbor as yourself"". Spend a little more time loving and a little less time telling people they will be going to hell, which for the record, may not even be real."	I don't need to fit your requirements of what compassion is, to be compassionate. Hypocrite. 	2
"Devil's advocate position noted, disagreement as follows: Suicide is a consequence of fundamental changes in both brain chemistry and brain structure, resulting in a distorted view of reality and self that makes suicide seem like the only actual option available to a person. Suicide, then, is less a consequence of individual choice and more a result of neurological changes outside of the control of an individual. If any entity is truly to ""blame"" I would point my finger not at the victim but at the society that persists in its ignorance and stigmatization of mental illness and its failure to produce an even remotely adequate system of mental health care and treatment. Also, most people who commit suicide do consider those they are leaving behind and generally leave notes to that effect apologizing."	you are right. :)	2

No as dumb as some arguements are they should still be heard. Even you deserve to be heard every once in a while ; )	I always keep talkin'... no one listens, but I keep talkin' !	2
Please try to be serious on this website .	Whar's wrong with trolololo????? ?????????????????	2
Where did you get your assertion that human beings and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure? Also, how do humans know that dolphins have sex for pleasure?, it's not like they could speak for themselves and tell humans they enjoy having sex. (remember)?	Studies :)   I don't know how they figure these things out, and for all I know it could be just something they said. But that's what I've been told.	2
You have zero limits. You have sympathy of a goddess. Remember when we got into that fight? And I won because you thought inflicting pain on me would be stupid? Yep. Thats you.	Gods and goddesses are not a sympathetic, understanding lot. They're more likely to horribly disfigure you for seeing them naked, or something.	2
Most Christians are because of what is written in the bible. It is because of Christianity that homosexuality was illegal for so long.	The government doesn't give a rats ass about religion. We have separation of church and state. Homosexuality was illegal because the government wanted to promote procreation in order to maintain the fertility rate. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalfertilityrate ;)	2
What I said about Adam and Eve was a statement. They ate the fruit, we were only born of them. Why are we sinners because they sinned was the only question. If we are sinners, that is because we sin. Yet in our lifetime we can only sin so much. There is a limit.	If we, without acceapting Jesus, sin. Then for those who don't will continue to sin in Heaven.	2
It is an argument against the existence of any major world religion's God. But not against the Good spirit in people and life that is manifest only when allowed to be. If not allowed, then evil comes forth.	Verily, the problem of whether a Creator (which may be inherently worthy of being called 'God') exists has become too tied up in specific theological formulations importing characteristics unnecessary to explain anything about such a Creator. But if 'God' is defined by characteristics including 'goodness' and 'active intervention' then this disqualifies the concept of 'God.'	2
Yes I believe they will burn in hell if they don't make that choice. If they choose not to believe in God then they send themselves to hell due to what they choose out of free will.	Is it freewill when a baby is born in an isolated country/place and have no knowledge of the Christian religion, therefore making them unable to know about Jesus, let alone to 'accept him in your life'. Is it freewill to be born with psychological problems that dictate the way they behave, causing them to murder someone, that would not of happened, had they not been born with psychological problems? Is it freewill for a child to be born in an Atheist family, and have their parent's influence to brush onto them to make them not want to follow any religions including Christianity? Just how is that freewill, srom, tell me.	2
The reason why I said those people disgust me is the people who wanted to learn about the history of it.  Even if I did have a gay child I wouldn't accept their lifestyle and I would constantly pray for them to see that they made a mistake.	Fair enough.... although I still think saying people that want to learn about gay history are disgusting is a bit harsh.	2
Every black person I have met has treated me like shit. They think they have their own language, but in fact they don't know how to use grammar or know how to spell. It's fucking annoying and what's more annoying is the bitches who are white and think they are black. I'm not racist and I have ALWAYS been nice to black people. I have (first) cousins who are half black and they too are rude.	Yeah, there are losers in every group. This one black woman said that I should not hang out with black people because I made the mistake with N Word in the past.	2
No, but the millions wasted in courts every year jumping through the extra legal loopholes that a capital trial entails are more than enough to oppose capital punishment.	I got that one figured out too. We make it so that if you are found guilty, you get one and only one appeal. After that, you go directly to the chair. You do not pass Go, you do not collect $200 ;)	2
You didn't, you did call him a Dictator however, but you clearly blame him for the war we are currently in. So whether you said it or not, you clearly think he did. I think you are mistaking me with you. Keep your Michael Moore logic away from intelligent debates.	I Concur. Calling Bush a dictator is quite suggestive. Bush was just a 'salesman' Congress was the dealer.---------------------------	2
I think Christianity describes a group of people with varying beliefs who for whatever reason wish to identify as Christian.	While I am A Protestant Christian so.... I think the term Christian Now Is So Vague it is almost meaningless Like Catholics and Protestants Disagree on Salvation itself, 6 books of the bible, Priesthood (For Some), Lent (For Some) and other things.	2
How about Atom Heart Mother? Wish you were here? Animals!	Of course of course! Whenever I have a bad day, I just come home and listen to Atom Heart Mother and that generally cleans me up. Listening to Alans Psycedellic Breakfast at the end is a great way for me to to maintain my insanity. Oh Syd, you crazy diamond. - I end up quoting Pink Floyd all to regularly on this site yet no one seems to notice. It makes me feel old.	2
Scientology is probably the least logical, It reminds me of a science fiction novel.	That's because the guy who created it was an actual science-fiction author lol.	2
Yes, please attention whore more. It is good for the site, I quite enjoy it, and it is super cool! Plus, I think there are some who stalk you on here (not like crazy...restraining order stalking), but good all in fun kind of stalking.	"The only way that it's especially good for the site is when I make a video I think X) Otherwise I""m just goofing around. You think that too, huh? >.> Yeah, I've used the jump feature on a few people and find them on my page often. I don't mind, it's just I didn't know if I was just imagining things. lol"	2
Okay?  	Srom I enjoyed your reaction to silas question .	2
New Username? Are you an old member who created a backup account or something?	No, you can change your username when you hit 1000 points.	2
What is it about gays that should be singled out and where is the option to say what you want banned and where?	You pose a two part question: 1, What is it about gays that should be singled out -Answer: Nuttin' really, I'm just on a gay kick 2, where is the option to say what you want banned and where? -Answer: You can say it right here yo!	2
Are you a Muslim? What about the law of abrogation?	Abrogation If it is done according to Islam ,it is a very good idea.but if it is done on the basis of modern human philosophy it is a tragedy.man can never be more wiser than god.	2
Ah,  You must believe that blatant ignorance and childish notions which are the root of discrimination, Should be treated civilly as if it were a valid point of view. That's fine. I do not though.  Likewise if a person with a tinfoil hat runs up to me and starts screaming there are flying rabbits eating his pet ewoks, I will laugh and not attempt to discover where these flying rabbits may be and save his pet ewoks. But by all means, go try to save his pet ewoks.	No, they should not be treated as a valid point of view, but instead of resorting to insults and name calling a much more constructive thing to do would be to try to explain to them the flaws in their logic in a friendly way. People are much more receptive to a friendly explanation than a personal insult. If you try to explain things nicely, the recipient will often view it as you trying to be helpful. On the flip-side, if you insult them they are going to view it as you trying to be harmful. Which of those two approaches do you think is more likely to get through to them?	2
Yo' man..., I b Awoke. Don't b knocking on my do'. I iz chilling ;) I took an Ebonics class and I like to get my money's worth every once in a while ;)	Yo shawty, whaddup?! ;)	2
Hmmm...., doesn't sound gay so far...., did you wear white?	I'm guessing a white wedding dress is typical which is gay? lol Mine was mostly white and silver with black trimming. The dress was not near the cost of a standard wedding dress but it was pretty and I was only going to wear it once.	2
"I would understand if you didn't like him because you thought his theories were bad That is why I don't like him. but saying things like "" I bet his books make you sick"" because one was called Nausea Hehe, that's classic. I don't remember saying that, but it is hilarious. I imagined you there dribbling with a stupid grin on your face. Kind of mean of you. I mean I know you're not stupid, just you were acting very stupid in that debate, about existentialism... You labeled me stupid because I said I exist. No hard feelings though."	"Hmm, at the time you told me you didn't know who he was and you knew little about philosophy. But now you say you don't like him because of his theories.. You know of his Parisian Café theories? < is why i raged. hearing people saying "" I don't know it but I don't like it "" is so damned stupid! Like refusing to eat a certain food, because "" you don't like it"" yet haven't tried it.  And you told me no one cares about what I said, hence the meanness. And just to add to that, I made a nice long debate for you all to complain to me about on how I am wrong and it makes no sense, e.t.c.  I do love the attention really :)"	2
Everyone knows the taxpayers hold all of the power in the whole nation. All of it. We're all just too lazy to form a single unified voice to scream at these people to stop putting money in their own pockets. Or perhaps we need a single unified fist. None the less, nobody is willing to drop anything for a few days in order to make change.(Not Obama change. Well, I guess Obama change, but that wasn't what I was getting at) We have all of the power. We're just too stupid and lazy to use it.	"Truly! Sad is the day wherein such words are self-evidently true, i.e., ""We have all of the power. We're just too stupid and lazy to use it.""!"	2
So intelligence jumped from ape to human in 300,000 years?	Did I claim that this happened? No. It's am incredibly slow process. It leads to the rise of humanity. Not divine intervention.	2
That's a Cosmonaut in the 1961 picture and that Afghan fella must be pretty ancient.  .	You are right. I should have said world history VS Afghanistan. And yes..., that poor Afghan fella is pretty old ;) Thank you for keeping me honest ;)	2
The fact that we haven't heard from him in a long time is good evidence that he doesn't exist.	No miracles,that science can't explain,the flu every year adapts to our medicine and over comes it by evolving,religious people pick and choose what they like from science,and say god created the time of day. So god created a world,planted some oil and coal in the ground,so you could destroy the earth with pollution. It would of been easier to create a perfect population and put them straight in heaven,so he make us perfect and eve fucked it all up,god knows all but he didn't know that his second human would betray him,sounds to me that he is an all unknowing!!!!!!!	2
Yep. And someone needs to do Moral Nihilism/Moral Relativism vs. Moral Objectivism.	I could be wrong, but I think I may have done relativism vs objectivism a while back? I dunno, I'm too lazy to check. Nihilism is a very interesting topic. If you were to create a debate on that, I'd probably post something. If you don't, I'll probably do it quite soon.	2
Choosing to help those that are less fortunate than you is a moral decision. Empathy is evolutionary, but to the level of helping those who are much worse off than you is more of years of cultural influence.  However, it may be better in preventing crimes when there are less impoverished, although there's no real telling for sure.	i see that as feasible. You should post on the opposing side.	2
Sometimes. But not often enough to oppose capital punishment ;)	No, but the millions wasted in courts every year jumping through the extra legal loopholes that a capital trial entails are more than enough to oppose capital punishment.	2
No. I mostly got reasons. We learned why this person did this and why this happens and why this lead to thid and what the reason was for this. Thats what we learned. We learned a lot in that class. We had a good teacher.	That was the same basic thinking for my history class. You can often times avoid biases by stating the events that led to the historical characters decision making. A good example of my teachers doing this well was their description of the build-up to the american revolution, that painted both sides with logical motives as well as occasional blunders.	2
It's possible to believe in a god or gods without believing any of them are infallible or worthy of worship. Thats what I believe, so what should I call myself since (According to currently popular definitions) I should stop identifying as atheist because I believe gods exist as personality complexes much like what is described in diagnoses of MPD It's also possible to be an atheist who believes a person or people are worthy of worship, if not infallible. So, as I see it, you think it's possible to truly be atheist, while having gods, that you don't refer to as gods,	It's possible to believe in a god or gods without believing any of them are infallible or worthy of worship.

So, as I see it, you think it's possible to truly be atheist, while having gods, that you don't refer to as gods, What should you call yourself? I don't know...how 'bout Steve? And by Steve I mean a person who makes up their own definition for words because I've decided that's what the definition of Steve is. Now let's have a long drawn out debate about dictionary definitions and your right to ignore and reinvent them as you're wont to do. Also, people have been known to worship human beings, so one need not be a theist to do so...unless of course you want to redefine the meaning of the word theist (which you do of course). 0 sec ago	2
To me, renewing your vows is a tacit admission that you have broken them, who really cares anyways? The money can be spent on something much better,	I think you make a very valid point... if they need to renew their vows, isn't that admitting there are problems?	2
At the moment it's watercolours, but I generally work in acrylics. I've got a link to my deviant art site on my profile if you want to take a look.	"I really like your art work. Especially ""The Eye of Ra."" But I'm not sure about your sandwich ;)"	2
Nobody is disputing that Hitler was not a theist, but it seems like you are trying to draw a connection between his beliefs and his actions which is wrong.	Actually, no I am not. Never once did I connect the content of his character to his beliefs. I am just correcting the ASSumption that he was an atheist, and for the record, I am a Christian.	2
If you speak to the anti-Catholics you will get bias answers if you speck to Catholics you will get bias answers but some where in the middle you will find the truth so its best to get both sides also as Q said reading Catholic litrachure is a great place to look.	Will do. Check your messages please. .	2

"People need to acknowledge the complexity of the situation. It's not just, ""Mr. Slave Trader is dead. I'm not responsible."" A wrong has been committed. On one hand, even if we were not directly involved in slavery, we, as the successors and new representatives of the United States, need to take responsibility for it. One example is Virginia's Resolution #728, which apologized for slavery. We can't be like Tom and Daisy in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, who ""let other people clean up the mess they had made."" On the other hand, it has been a long time. Monetary reparations will not work anymore. And many would argue that many (but not all) African-Americans have had a ""defeatist"" mindset ingrained in them, something that will take a long time to recover from. In the end, the best strategy for the moment is to just acknowledge the wrong done, learn from it (not just slavery, but the fact that our actions today have a huge impact on tomorrow), and move on."	"I think everyone does acknowledge it. But I certainly won't say ""I'm sorry"" for something I had no part in and would oppose strongly."	2

Then, why are we disputing each other by the way? We're supposed to be supporting each other since we both have our views about the tap water thing.We are also both against the replacement of bottled water for tap water.

A flat tax is most equitable. It can be economically and morally balanced by ending subsidization. The question shouldn't be what percentage of wealth is owned by the highest tax payers, but what percentage of the wealth is produced by them.  Taxes provide dis-incentives. Income taxes provide a dis-incentive to produce.	My belief is that if we keep changing taxes, we will always have problems. It's like a car, one month I put in 4 quarts of oil. Next month 5, next month 3. Who would expect that to work? The question shouldn't be what percentage of wealth is owned by the highest tax payers, but what percentage of the wealth is produced by them.  He said taxes are high, look they pay 52%. If they are making all of the money, you would expect a lot more than half the taxes. I think you may have been asking the same question I was trying to ask. I am not saying that if a guy made a million dollars last year he should still pay taxes this year just because he has more than everybody. I was strictly talking about how much they make in the year. Taxes provide dis-incentives. Income taxes provide a dis-incentive to produce. What are you talking about? Every time I see my paycheck I am thrilled to see how much Uncle Sam got ;) /endsarcasm	2
It seems like you're talking mostly about whether America could do it, but what about other nations? I don't see anything wrong with your points, they are very good. Just wondering whether you think it would work elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, they cut off people's hands if they steal still, and many people think that is acceptable, but elsewhere (most of the world) it isn't. And it's not necessarily to do the exact same to someone else, but could be seen as something equal and fair. (In my opinion, I don't see the act of chopping someone's hands off as fair in any way)	"Yeah, I guess I feel I only have the authority to speculate in regards to the U.S. I do think other nations could abide by such a legal system in a way that is pragmatically effective, but I don't think any legal system based on the above statement would actually be supporting the people. I think most of the efficacy of such a legal system would stem from the public's understanding that the consequences of their actions are somehow more concrete, more permanent. The idea of doing time for stealing (or any other crime) or the idea of a fine is a little more abstract, and I think when people have a lapse in judgment our legal system (my legal system? I'm assuming you're American) may not do as much to actually sway their final decision since they may not have a true awareness of what they're getting themselves into. But as effective as an ""eye for an eye"" legal system may be, I see it as something that relies primarily on fear rather than on the understanding that certain actions are considered criminal because they are a detriment to society. I'm not saying our system is much better as it allows most people to pay their way out of trouble without helping them make a real paradigm shift. And you bring up a good point about the penalty for stealing in Saudi Arabia. Neither of us see it as a fair punishment, but fair is culturally relative. I'm all for the humane treatment of criminals, but perhaps most of the populace of Saudi Arabia sees this as humane enough. If that's so, it's difficult to say whether anyone should try to change their customs. That gets into an ethical debate which has many sides to it, and I'm not sure where I fall."	2
This does look very bad. Although, if it makes you feel any better, the Republicans were against wording that specifically helped gays, immigrants and Native Americans, so the Republicans were not voting against women when voting against the violence against women bill.	i am even more against them now that you said that. Everyone has the right to not be a victim of violence.	2

I guess the question would be.... what makes for an extraordinary life?	A number of names come to mind, the main one would be Sir Richard Francis Burton.	2
What is the difference between Jews and Christians? Basically the religion is the same. 2000 years ago, all christians were jews. A jew believes, that God and the Holy Spirit exists. Jesus - or Messiah is the person they're expecting. They are excepting the person, christians believe have already been here. That is the main difference between those religions. So when Jesus came, some people chose to go on with their old beliefs, and keep on waiting for Messiah(Those were the Jews), and some chose to believe that Jesus was the expected Messiah(Those were the Christians). So if Jesus never came to earth, then the new testament never would have been written, and all jews would still be jews. No one would teach a new religion (christianity) about Jesus. If you google: What is christianity based on You'll find several answers that look like: Jesus blah blah blah.. If christianity is based on Jesus, then it is based on the new testament. Because Jesus did not exist in the old testament. Jesus is what christianity is based on - therefore christianity is based on new testament, not the entire bible. (actually only the four first books in the bible, the Gospels, which tells the story of Jesus Christ)	I agree. After all, the Bible (the CHRISTIAN HOLY BOOK) has in it the Old Testament and the New Testament, therefore the Christians who put it together must've been under the impression that it was a Christian Book. Before that, in the Bible, Jesus quotes from the scriptures, some of which are the books in the Old Testament. Christians believe Jesus is God. Christians also believe that you cannot go against God. Therefore, any Christians following this debate would have to agree wholeheartedly.	2
You get points only for appealing to my dorky side.  10 points Slytherin!	What? Why Slytherin? I'm more likely to be a Hufflepuff, I thiink. .-.	2
The reverse is true too. There are some instances wherein those feelings are wrong, and then we regret it because we followed our intuition. I'm a prime example of that. I used to be a very devout Christian, but after lots of praying and in-depth studying I discovered that it was false. So, I wasted 25 years of my life going to church, paying tithing, and praying to a god that doesn't even exist. Yeah, id say that what you said is somehow true. And somehow I understand your point because you used to be a Christian, and im quite baffled that you gave up on your religion so easily. But, somehow, Im guessing, you are regretting that you've helped other people because of the payment that you have given. The donations help other people, and I dont think that you have wasted your time as a Christian. Even if Im already going away from the topic, I just want to say that.. nothing was wasted because you were able to help other people. Even without religion, you could still do. My lack of belief in god isn't so much based on facts as it is lack of facts. I've seen no credible evidence or logical arguments that support the belief in a god. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like your saying basing something off of just a feeling is just as credible as basing something off of facts because those facts may be wrong. I seriously doubt you believe that, so I'm probably just misunderstanding you. Yes, there is not enough evidence as to how to prove that there is a God.. Maybe you'd say that people who have religion are illogical, but then, you cant attest to them because they are just defending their beliefs no matter how illogical it was. The next thing and statement you said, about the correct me if im wrong thing, I didt understand it much. So please be kind to explain what you were saying, so that it could clear my mind. Is there another method of determining the truth of something that is more effective than using logic? Hmm. Using facts. Well, Im the one who is disputing what I have said in my earlier debates. Thanks to that. But, i just want to say that even if Im a little groggy right now, and I have no idea what I am saying, i want to thank you for being nice on your debates.	"im quite baffled that you gave up on your religion so easily It was not easy. If you read my reply to Safiya below, you'll see it was not easy at all. <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Do_homosexuals_contradict_themselves_by_wanting_to_get_married/comment#arg338776'>http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Do_homosexuals_contradict_themselves_by_wanting_to_get_married/comment#arg338776                                         Maybe you'd say that people who have religion are illogical, but then, you cant attest to them because they are just defending their beliefs no matter how illogical it was.  I completely understand their need to defend their beliefs. I've been in their shoes and used all the same arguments they are using now. It's like looking in a mirror at my past self. I'm simply trying to get people to examine their beliefs and really take some time to study whether those beliefs are based on a solid foundation, or if they are just believing what was taught to them as a child. I think in life it is important to not just go with the flow or accept things at face value. I think people should challenge their beliefs and look at all sides of the issues. That is why I like debate websites, because you get to hear things from a lot of different perspectives. The #1 bit of advice for Christians is study your Bible, and not just the warm fuzzy parts of it, and as you are studying ask yourself ""are these the actions of a loving god?"" The next thing and statement you said, about the correct me if im wrong thing, I didnt understand it much. So please be kind to explain what you were saying, so that it could clear my mind.  I wasn't 100% sure what you were saying either, which is why my response probably didn't make much sense to you. Maybe we should just forget it before we confuse ourselves even more :)"	2
I am not a little boy and I personally advocate abolishing IQ tests altogether because I believe that speed of learning and memorizing isn't anything to do with intelligence, it is instead one of almost infinite aspects comprising it (but IQ seems to assume that this to be the only factor in determining intelligence). Hitler was neither left-wing nor right-wing. He was an economic centrist who leaned to right-wing philosophy a lot of the time (hence he had a heavy war on communist Russia as a huge advocate of capitalism).	"He was an economic centrist who leaned to right-wing philosophy a lot of the time (hence he had a heavy war on communist Russia as a huge advocate of capitalism). Are you serious? How many times to I have to explain it to you? Socialism: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. Hitler nationalized most of the German economy. Nationalizing means to make something owned by the government. Hitler was not a capitalist in the least.  ""We are not fighting Jewish or Christian capitalism, we are fighting every capitalism."" - Hitler"	2
It's an unfair representation (goes against the intended result of the laws put in place), but I don't see how it's incorrect. However, it does only work if the person is truly sorry, I believe, which is unlikely in this example.	I can't make an argument because you pretty much said all that needed to be said.	2

Cult: system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or subject. By this definition, most religions are cults.	True, however that's not the point of the debate. The point is that she's taking offense to a prayer and has taken specific action to make it not be allowed. However, if a Christian takes offense to an atheist and even thinks about saying something they're all of a sudden a bigot.	2
I'd be downright ashamed at the lunacy of Glenn Beck if I were a conservative. He can and does single-handedly devalue the entirety of the conservative beliefs. Everyday he tries so hard to falsely correlate the dissociated knowledge of ignorant Americans. The sad part is that he succeeds, and incredibly so. Because of this, he has the leverage and power to start an ignorant revolution. He is a threat to the very people whom worship the ground on which he walks.	I'd be downright ashamed at the lunacy of Glenn Beck if I were a conservative.  Which is precisely why I theorized that he is secretly a liberal just trying to shame - for the lack of a better word - the conservatives! He is a threat to the very people whom worship the ground on which he walks. Why? I've watched some of his clips from his website or from youtube, and I still do not know what it is about him which liberals loathe. Take this video. Besides my being surprised by his explicit religiosity, I saw nothing wrong with it. <a href='http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/42891/'>http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/42891/  Then, of course, there is this video about Glenn Beck (and a few others): <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqgYpfsrcJw'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqgYpfsrcJw  Frankly, it's the last video which 'takes the cake'; everybody makes fun of these people; yet, in the end, they can be right (no pun intended).

Oh, I see what you're talking about and you are correct but I think we just started the long long drop but do we have a parachute to save us.	If it's started it hasn't hit me yet. I have noticed increasing gas prices, but that's always been constantly going up. I have acquaintances who smoke that tell me the cost of cigarettes is outrageous but I assume that's just the government trying to make as much money as they can off of that stuff before the public completely quits.	2
"The supernatural is unreasonable because it is defying logic, physics, and reason. Therfore any religion is then automatically unreasonable. And why do you say ""OUR unjustified lucky guess about the existence of the supernatural""? I'm making no such guess. In fact all my bets are on that it is NOT real/true. And you then you attempted to give the supernatural a scientific hypothesis as to what it might be. But the supernatural by definition defies physics, science, logic, ect. It's not a matter of us not being advanced enough to detect/test it, it's that it's literally opposite of how everything works and is therfore pretty much 100% false.  A reasonable religon isn't possible. It's dependent upon supernatural entities/forces which cannot coexist with what we know about the universe."	"Ave, I think you misunderstand me.

But that is precisely what I do; droning on beyond the attention span of some users and digging more deeply into others arguments are not mutually exclusive. And I also think that the biggest problem with debate is the idea that one side or the other has to 'win.' Really, it should be a win for both sides. I should also note that being antagonistic for the sake of being antagonistic is not a win either, friend. At any rate, we've gotten quite far off topic; the start of it was only tangentially related and now we're debating debate styles. I'm done here, but by all means reply again if you feel you must.	"And I also think that the biggest problem with debate is the idea that one side or the other has to 'win.' Really, it should be a win for both sides. I should also note that being antagonistic for the sake of being antagonistic is not a win either, friend. When you start to ""question"" things by bringing up stuff that is unrelated or stupid it sounds like you are being antagonistic for the sake of being antagonistic. Is questioning someones word choice to the microscopic level really questioning what someone believes?"	2

How do you have freedom of religion, if you don't have the freedom to not choose a religion at all. If one doesn't want to be a part of any religion, then Freedom of religion doesn't apply to them, because they don't have FULL freedom of that choice, it being limited.

Emotion: The affective aspect of consciousness : feeling  b : a state of feeling  c : a conscious mental reaction (as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong feeling usually directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body By this definition, if you ever respond to a stimuli and it affects your state of consciousness you are experiencing emotion.

"Perhaps I gave away my point, but I sincerely believe they will. Holidays are already to a point where people just give each other gifts and say whatever, ""I love you too"" I believe it's not long before the title goes out the window too and people just says ""Happy mumble something"" then exchange gifts."	they lost their meaning a long time ago. Nearly all festivals are based on earlier ones. Christmas for instance. Christmas is not the date Jesus' birth Rather it is the date chosen to represent it. Christmas originally was the Birth-date of the Pagan God Sol Invictus (Roman god) the Christians chose this date because a) it was already a festival and therefore easy to do and b) to show once and for all that they had replaced the old ways with their own. The current festivals are heading the same way, they are losing their own meaning as more and more as people are either atheist or there is a greater mixture of religions present in society. It is inevitable that one day the dates of these festivals will be used or a date near them will be used to some other holiday of some sort. The way things are going these festivals will revolve around consumption (reminds me of BRAVE NEW WORLD) and the giving of gifts that have been bought. Is this a bad thing? maybe not, so long as people do not need to buy things that cause them to live beyond their means. Perhaps the festivals will not revolve around consumption but looking at Easter and Christmas it certainly seems this is the likely outcome of current trends. P.S. most of us have the day off for holidays/festivals so if our society feels the need to consumption/giving based festivals can we create new ones on different dates so we get more days off?	2

It would be easier to understand because you were getting the thought as they were, as how it makes sense to them it makes sense to you.  How it would be initiated. Would two or more people mutually open a telepathy channel? In these groups of more than one using the telepathy, how will it be decided to kick someone out of the circle?  Very good questions, I should have thought about in the beginning. Ideally channels would be the answer. As for your second question, I'm not totally sure thinking about it now... Majority vote I suppose, you can have a private channel to everyone individually in case someone needs to communicate ""this person is bothering me"" or what not.  Spam. People could spam the channel with stupid thoughts. We can already do that though lol. Ideally we can just close off communications with anyone we want and open up with anyone we want. Though that was never established so it is kind of open-ended I guess."	2

"It's concrete. I know there is a correct answer to every problem, even if that answer is ""DNE"" or undefined. Literature classes, however, are extremely subjective and I never interpret things the way others do. I just don't like being in that grey area."	My thought exactly,  I hate English class. I don't have trouble with grammar it's just that I hate trying to find another meaning to some old text. I hate it when the right answer is based on the writer or the teacher's opinion.  My favorite math is geometry because it's something I can use more often.	2

Delawarians get more of a say than Californians. There are 917K people in Delaware, and 38 million in California. Delaware gets an electoral vote for every 305K people. California only gets a vote for each 691K people. Each person in Delaware has twice as much voting power as the people in California.	True true very true...

"""If you have a private golf club that is men only, is that not discriminating against women?"" No. Because they also have a right to form a golf club for women.  ""It is designed for the ""exclusive use"" of a certain group of people to the ""exclusion"" of others""  Actually there's nothing stopping white people from joining.

I don't remember the exact verses, but in both Matthew and Mark, Jesus told listeners that some of them would still be alive during the second coming. This was, of course, 2000 years ago...

This makes no sense. Are you saying they want to go back to living in teepees and hunting buffalo? I don't think so. Give up their iPhones? What are they on shrooms? ;)	Actually, a guy went to interview a Chieftain recently to see if he had insight on why society is having troubles. The Chieftain replied: When we were around man got to hunt all day, come home to fresh cooked meal, smoke peace pipe, and have sex every night. White man thought he could come in and improve on that. What are they on shrooms? ;) Nope, peyote, or something you can smoke in a peace pipe. ;)	2
"The point of the court system should be to determine whether this person's ignorance was reasonable in the first place for, let's say, a difference in State laws. But my main problem with this statement is that there are a shit load of laws out there, and many of them are not only unreasonable, but unknown. To expect people to know every law in where they live is kind of retarded, especially when the laws don't seem very reasonable. To say ""Ignorance of the law is no excuse"" is making the claim that all citizens should know every single law put in place. In order for government to be justified in making that claim, they would need to force citizens to go through courses that would teach them every single law; and that system of government would be, in the end, unreasonable and unjustifiable."	This is especially true since nobody truly knows what the whole of the law is, not just everyday people. Even lawyers don't know for sure, even judges don't know for sure - that is why some trials that last for years and go through multiple courts, and people's lives and fortunes can be forever changed by one tiny technicality that gets the great legal minds squabbling on and on. Judges shape the law as they decide a case; nobody, including themselves, knows what the law is and how it applies to a particular case until it's been decided. I don't think that somebody should be set free just because it looks like they didn't know what they did was illegal, although it should be a major factor for consideration during trial and sentencing.	2
"Do you seriously mean to suggest that it is wrong to form exclusive social groups? Every single religious organization ever is an exclusive group organized explicitly around addressing and advocating and celebrating theism. Every civil rights group organizes around an issue. Social groups frequently are exclusive, often membership based. Humans are generally predisposed to seek out in-groups of like-minded people.  Forming and participating in such groups does not mean that you have to exclude those who do not share your identity/views in every part of your life and never work with them; it means that you are setting aside a part of your life for something that interests you and that you care about. Someone can join an atheist ""church"" and still work with theists on issues outside of their congregation... just like theists can go to their church and still work with atheists outside of their congregation."	"Do you seriously mean to suggest that it is wrong to form exclusive social groups? That's not what I'm saying, but after rereading what I wrote again I see how it could easily come across that way. My comments were directed at The Sunday Assembly specifically and not atheists churches in general. I guess I should have been more clear about that. I have no problem with people forming exclusive groups. However, in this particular case it goes against their mission statement which states ""Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential."" From what I've read about them they don't even talk about atheism. In fact, ""a few weeks ago, a group of the original NYC organizers split away, claiming to be discontented with the Sunday Assembly’s lack of sufficiently explicit atheist advocacy, and formed a competing group they’re calling Godless Revival."" [<a href='http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2013/11/the-sunday-assemblys-american-tour/'>1]. So now we're already seeing different denominations forming. The whole thing just reeks of religion. The Sunday Assembly is more like a humanist group that just talks about being a good person and doing charitable work, which is great, but if their goal truly is to ""help everyone find and fulfill their full potential"" and encourage people to ""live better, help often, and wonder more"" then excluding people just because they believe in a god seems to go against their mission statement. If they want to exclude theists they can, but they need to change their mission statement and not pretend like they are really about helping the community as a whole. That's my main beef with them. I'm also a little leery about what their true motives are. They are trying to get people to donate $800,000 to expand their operations. That may be a legit reason, but the whole thing just reeks of churches bilking their followers out of their hard earned money and pocketing a big chunk of it. I hope my suspicions are wrong and that they truly are about making the world a better place, but at the moment I remain a little skeptical."	2

"Hmm... Well, I haven't really studied any other religious documents, so I don't know if they refer to their god/s as a specfic gender (except the Greek and Roman gods, but most accept the fact that they don't exist), so I'll stick with ""God has no gender."" :p"	Though that kind of goes against my big IF our creator has a gender. But that's how I feel. Though if it DOES have one, I'd have to say female. And not because I'm one.	2
Yes, but you can still debate whether a religion is true, by attacking the flaws.	Yeah, but you can't attack the flaws of religion in general, you have to address the individual.	2
Well i cant say yes wholeheartedly though it is the best gun i know of. I say a history channel special on it. It's really rugged and tough to break or jam. Has great fire rate and power. Can be field stripped and repaired in a very short amount of time. And is clearly the favorite of many countries. The only thing it suffers in is accuracy and its not even that bad. Plus i love it in MW3 ;)	I say a history channel special on it. It's really rugged and tough to break or jam. One of my roommates (he's something of a gun-nut) was trying to explain to me why AKs are tough and reliable. He said its basically because they're poorly made and not finely tuned to begin with, so knocking some loose parts around doesn't make the gun any more or less accurate or functional than it was before. Comparatively, a lot of other guns are more precisely built and finely tuned, so any damage to that precise structure and they stop working (although producing guns that work in all conditions (sandstorms, in water, banged up, etc) has been a major focus for the gun manufacturers of the world, recently). You see this in cars, too. Cheap, roughly built cars are oftentimes the most reliable and the easiest to repair; complex, high performance vehicles are more prone to errors and typically more difficult to fix.  And, on a personal note, I dislike the gun in MW3. It's rate of fire is too slow and it's not powerful enough. Give me an FAD or a CM901, instead.	2
Ah I see, but the troll will have a slower climb to 500 points right?	No. It wouldn't slow them at all. If they make 500 posts and they don't down-vote anyone then they have 500 points.

Still, I doubt Jc would have the patients to get to 500 points if he couldn't DV so I still think its a good idea. Plus it would encourage new people to increase their activity.	2

I don't think you can eve say marginally to be honest. Look at the way the USSR treated the Ukraine and the other regions they occupied, its very hard to make and argument that this was in anyway better than Hitler's Germany.	Stalin was particularly rough on the Ukraine, he killed about a quarter of its population, but Hitler regime killed half its population.	2
Actually they kill people on the death row by injecting stuff into your blood stream the shuts down your body. You don't feel any real pain, just mental if your innocent, or guilty.	"I know very well how they kill people I used it as a topic in my class debate a few years ago. It would be extreme mental torture, far worse than being whipped or having your knee caps broken. Someone out there is has killed your loved ones, and is strolling around happily, whilst you're in there about to be killed. Not only the horror of your family being killed, you too will be killed. And you will know, right to the last second, that the people doing it are happily thinking "" hey, we're doing a good thing! And tomorrow, we'll do the same to 8 more guys!""  But electric chair I would imagine you would experience a few seconds of pain, like someone connecting a car battery to the inside of your head and rubbing the wires together. Either way, I can't imagine what it would be like for that to Hollywood, and people would watch it and come out of the cinema crying ( if the director was any good..!) But the fact is, this is happening all the time, to so many people, so very, very unjustly. And we then go and call our selves a 'civilisation'. There's nothing civil about it.   Saying that you're doing something humanely has come to mean on average a bad thing. "" We're killing humanely"" or"" it's the humane thing to do"" or ""It's only humane to do such and such in war"" e.t.c. So many examples that go with that that prove that it humane= unhappy end. But I digress. Most cases, someone who shoots someone out of rage will not do it again. They should still go to jail, but if an innocent man gets killed, in such a fashion, that's wrong."	2

"The reason the movie is rated R is because it wasn't intended for minors. I don't see movies being too violent or even video games. And hell, if there's something you don't like in a movie, here's a thought: Don't watch it. People don't seem to realize however, that there's been some pretty sick shit in Hollywood's avid movie producing past. The new versions of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre literally have nothing on the twisted and disturbing visage the original paints. It's still hard for me to watch. It scares the living hell out of me, like the demons of the director, the script writer, and the cast had all taken hold of my very soul. Okay, that's a little dramatic, but that movie scares the Jesus out of me. The new versions are 'eh' scary but they're more like ""OH THIS THING IS JUMPING OUT AT YOU. NOW HERE IS A TORTURE SCENE."" and less tension and atmosphere."	Debate or debating is a formal method of interactive and representational argument.

Correct, many woman use it as a type of bleaching agent for blood stains due to that property. In fact it works very well. However, commercialized bleach is a chlorine compound not a water and oxygen compound. There is a difference. Especially, due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide is a medicinal agent that your body produces to fight off infections and sickness already. Bleach merely poisons you.	Why women in particular? I was introduced to Hydrogen peroxide as bleach at school.	2

We could start taming dinosaurs, and have them fight against each other and name all their cool and unique moves. We could have those go out and collect each individual dinosaur at the age of ten, call themselves, a dinosaur trainer. Have gyms set up where gym leaders battle dinosaur trainers, and if they are beaten they give the trainer a badge. If you collect all eight badges you can go to a dinosaur tournament where all the best trainers go to battle each other's dinosaurs. We can nickname them, and have a strong philosophy revolving around young kid's love between their dinosaurs and them. ;)	<a href='http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/stegro1.gif'>THATS A GREAT IDEA	2
"I think peer pressure is more subtle in reality than ""Hey, Joey, wanna smoke some pot?"" It's more like, being around it regularly and respecting the people who do those things will make you more apt to try them."

You can respect someone without respecting their drug use, as well.	2
"1. I don't say that it's wrong but here's the problem as I see it. let's say the fourth person brought in is already married to SIX others.  Yeah? So ? You need to explain what you think is wrong with that, or whatever you think if you don't think it's wrong 2. See above. If one people has a right to two spuses of their choice so does everyone else and it might not be the ones they are already married to. Imagine the domestic disputes on the future ""Cops"" episodes. Grab some popcorn! Not sure I understand you, and not sure you understood me there. I'll try to explain: Let's say you and me are married. I can not be married to you, unless you are married to me too, right? If we were married, we were married to each other. Let's take that into a number of three. Let's say, you, Dana and me were married. Let's say the law said, that polygamy is allowed if everyone is married with everyone. That would mean, I am married to you and Dana, Dana is married to you and me, and you are married to me and Dana. Understand? Everyone is married to everyone. It would not be like... I am married to you, and then I have three other spouses, that you don't have. Do I explain myself better? And what do you think of that?"	1. Inevitable domestic disputes are going to be exponentially harder to resolve, the more spouses you bring to the marriage. This would involve custody disputes, parental visitation rights, property rights, employee benefits, insurance claims, etc. It's complicated enough with only two people in a marriage.  2. Let's say Dana meets a man at the mall and wants to cheat on both of us and she brings us home a little present in the form of a pregnancy, aids or some other VD. Or, let's say Dana falls in love with two or three other married couples and wants in on their marriages but we don't want any part of it. Would we have a right to deny Dana her other marriage wants?	2

This does logically constitute as not 'everyone' needing a week's worth of vacation. Because of the way the question is worded, I agree with you.	I disagree with this statement. I think it is enough to have only a few days for break off. Sometimes people may have vacation for month but feeling of relaxion zero. The first reason that i disagree with the statement is that, it is not convinient for employee.The week vacation release reproductivity of the work. I suggest to give a few a days but every months.I thinks it`s better for employee and employer. For example for Kazakhstani workers there is no need to have a week holiday because there are so many holidays during the year. It`s for about one half month if we collect the dates of the holidays. The second reason time and money that spend for week holiday.Legally the company must pay for it and it`s not beneficial for them. The third reason is now we are living in democratic country.I think there is no need to repeat the Soveit Unions mistakes. I mean when Soviet Union paid for each worker for holiday flight, food etc.. Finally, there became huge economic gap which let Soviet Union to collepse. It`s not benefical for state. I think it will be easier make the same beaches and entertainment near the working office or area, to economize time and money.	2

I am going to find the article but most of my friends don't believe inevolution.	Those are your friends, majority of the world doesn't deny evolution because of the vast amount of evidence for it. If so, then it would be the public, as the science community, the researchers and scientists definitely for the most part accept it. Majority of people accepting something isn't reason to throw it out of schools. The point of school is to learn, therefore the best scientific theories get taught in school, evolution is one of the best theories. It would be unfair to throw it out of school, that is not how school is supposed to be. School shouldn't care about beliefs, it should care teaching us knowledge, you know things that are fact and proven.	2

"Verse 24 and 25 contradict immediately.  ""And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."" This is Verse 24.  ""And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good."" Verse 25.  WTF?  Clearly either all are of his kind or the cattle are excluded. Either way you still are incorrect.  And yes, the earth brought forth life. Not god forming. Life came from the ground and species appeared ""after their kind"".  The verses don't support you. Only the Cattle do.  No water is mentioned. Life was created out of the water the ""day"" before. Life appeared on earth then life appeared on land, exactly like evolution.  Oh I missed that. So God made them from water and spawned them. Still doesn't follow evolution since only the cattle came from themselves. It's illogical. You know how evolution also doesn't apply in the bible? How does grass grow or any plany before the sun existed? It would be freezing. Grass grew before any photons hit them. That makes no sense."	"OK I'm gonna ignore the part about ""after their kind"" with you because you don't under Hebrew. Literary devices. And no, the sun existed before it is mentioned. The verse says God created ""light in the firmament"". He let the light through to the point that you could see the sun. Beifre it was hot and gaseous and opaque, allowing plant life to form.

Ah, Pascals Wager. True if god exist then the atheist are paying a heavy price. But what if you god isn't the real god? suppose you have chosen to believe in the god of Christianity, But is you die and suddenly you are seeing Allah, or the Olympian gods. Then what.	Or worse. Suppose you believe in any god, but god hates people who believe that a god exists.	2
Not a mouse, it is clearly a teddy bear. It is awesome though.	Look at the nose... it's a mouse.	2
I've taken a break from this site a few times. Not because I needed to though. I just got preoccupied with other things. Anyone who needs to take a break has some problems lol.	"""Anyone who needs to take a break has some problems "" Well duh. Any time you need something it's because you have a problem. Don't see what's funny about that."	2
You should probably remember we're sticking to traditional vampires. So no incredible super-speed that Mr. Cullen possesses. Though on the bright side the traditional vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, and mist. wonders if anyone will notice the irony	I thought all vampire already had these traditional powers. People just never mention them.	2
i'm an atheist and i support you 100%. fuck all the fags. their lifestyle is a choice and the concept of gay marriage is a mockery of the institution.	Yeah but I don't hate gays because they are still people I just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  Wow I have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. I am impressed.	2
"That statement needs clarification. What meaning is intended by ""the lack there of""? Lack of what."	lack of religion .	2
"Most of it is from the old testament, though jesus does say killing kids is okay if they're all upidy and whatnot. Also, you're catholic, you eat jesus every sunday thus ""eating people"" kind of a silly thing if one thinks about it - as if our digestive track is the road to salvation."	2 tru another reason i will never become a catholic i dont particularly aprove of cannabalism and its just wrong to eat your master what kind of obiedience is that	2
I guess it's just a matter of opinion at this point. 	Everyone has a desire to keep living. You claim that we ought to just kill ourselves, therefore contradicting our desire to keep living. Obviously, the burden of proof is on you. It may just be a matter of opinion, but until you argue in favor of it, your claim can be disregarded. Your opinion is bad.	2
Not really, I mean, I just joined pretty much and I am not the type to make friends online then miss them, so my answer would have to be no... but everyone is different I guess ;) Hope the party goes well - parties out here are all about dancing and good times but I have heard from tourists that American parties are something quite different and to be honest they seem rather dull. Any idea of what yours will be like?	I have no idea what he's up to, so no, I have no idea what it'll be like. But I'll let you know after it's over.	2
11 is young Too young for what? I started masturbating in elementary school. I didn't even know what I was doing. But it's proof that sexual urges start young. No exploiting at all. And I think it's wrong to push down and hide what it is kids are so curious about.  It makes them want to lie to their parents more, it makes them think that sex is something that is wrong, and it makes them more self-conscious about something that's natural. And pornography has been around for ages, it's been more public in different times than it is now, and those times flourished.  I seriously think it's wrong to hide such things because the negative effects it has, what harm does it do to be introduced to sex, and pornography, at a young age?	I knew about sex at age 11 -just never watched porn in my life. 11 is a time when hormones are unstable if you introduce porn at such an early stage then they will want more once it is a little more calm and stable then fine- And why show them? And how is there no exploitation? It makes me feel it's so irresistible when it's not once you think about how it is being made. Sometimes you get aroused only by reading.	2
No, I haven't heard of King Crimson, the music of mad scientists. Where can I pirate some of their music ;)	"I've only heard their first album, which I've grown quite fond of. It's ""In the Court of the Crimson King"". I'm not sure where you can find it. I physically bought it. Recently I heard part of a song from their newest album and something strange happened withn those forty years. It went from classical rock back then to some form of Tool like metal."	2
I guess I just believe that everything has a source. :)	So does everyone. Every scientist agrees with you and so do i. However, where we differ is where you and other theists want to call it a conscious being and we want to find out exactly what IT is through science.	2
Environmental impact? Does anyway of eating cause much environmental impact? Eating a giant steak shouldn't cause much more environmental impact than eating a carrot, or am I mistaken? I chose veganism because I am vegan, but I don't do it for the environment, I do it for the animals, and that is mainly what veganism is about.	I'm talking about the environmental impact of getting the food to your plate. I've heard (but not confirmed) that raising animals for food accounts for 80% of our land use and 33% of our fossil fuel use. On the other hand, I've also heard (but not confirmed) that growing vegetables destroys the land even more than raising animals for food.	2
Your on the positive end of this argument. It's your job to provide evidence for your case. Unless, you simply don't have any and you are drawing nearer to a last resort.  Oh no. A dead end As I expected. No evidence? Shall I cease trying to argue this portion of your argument with you? Or do you wish for me to show you why I believe emotion exists?	Or do you wish for me to show you why I believe emotion exists? Sure, explain. 	2

No it isn't. It is 20 times harder to manage your money when you have 1/20 the amount of money to live off of. I described situations where the people can't help it because of outside influences.	Just keep on repeating what I said keep on.	2
He never said anything about the government doing it. He said that they need to change because their stupid form of thinking is causing people to quit.	I realize that, however the comment was made within the context of the question which implicitly makes it a statement favoring coercive action by the government towards religious organizations. If that was not the intent, then the remark was out of place in the debate.	2
a 1000 days is not that long, it is about four years.     	That's fucking long.	2
"There is a very important clause in the Bill of Rights called ""the free exercise thereof"". Basically, the government cannot pass a bill that specifically prohibits the exercise of a religion, which is exactly what you are saying. So you believe that all Americans have the right to stop whatever they're doing, no matter what it is they're doing or when they're doing it, if they'd rather pray instead?"	She was getting mad for them praying at the beginning of a meeting.	2
"Gay people do not have ""less rights"" than straight people. They have the same rights, they just chose not to exercise some rights and what they want, instead, is amended rights. For example, gay people have the right to marry (just like everyone else) as long as it is with a person of the opposite sex. Gays chose not to exercise that right (for obvious reasons) and so they want to amend the ""right"" to marry. I used ""right"" in quotes because I don't see how marriage is a right.  Think about this, is driving a right or a privilege? If it is a right, then why do we need to file for a driver's license?  How about the right to pursue happiness? We don't need a license for that.  How about marriage? We do need a license for that."	Compare the laws, gay people have limited marriage rights, str8 people may marry where ever when ever, gay people use rights to there advantage all the time but I guess you fail to see that. I have gone into a law/rights book, I compared both gay rights and str8 rights. It seems that str8 people have more rights then homosexuals do. Don't believe me? examples: Straights can and gays can-not. 1. children, adoption. 2. free legal marriage any where in the USA even religions go against the homosexuals, they say they shouldn't even be in some religions, only the religions that go against it. (I know this may have nothing to do with it I just thought I would add that in)	2

Despite what people say in order to be perceived as politically correct, most people do no react well to diversity. People are naturally attracted to the company of those like themselves. If this is untrue then why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? Diversity IS the cause of conflict if the natural human reaction to it is a negative one, and I think it obviously is. Expecting people to embrace those that are different from themselves is expecting them to go against human nature. You say that diversity can exist in the absence of conflict, but can you name a diverse community or nation that does not have conflict between it's differing races or cultures? I would like to see an example of a harmonious, multicultural society.	why do people separate themselves racially and culturally at every given opportunity (for instance, school lunchrooms)? I'm not disagreeing with you, but could it be that we are afraid of what will happen? If you have always grown up around a group of people and one day meet up with another group, you will judge the new group by stereotypes that you've always heard.	2
I heard that oral sex causes throat cancer. Maybe they'll develop a product for that ;-)	They have already; two products in fact: the dildo and fleshlight. And if you're not feeling as polite, there is also a product for you: the plastic prank tongue.	2
Thanks for taking me up on the offer.  Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) This is completely understandable, however if you pick up any study Bible, you will find this is a declarative statement only. God didn't create the sun, moon, stars, or planets on that day, he simply called the appearance of the sun day, and the appearance or visibility of of the moon night. This is because the clouds or earths atmosphere cleared allowing for you to see the sun and moon from the earth. Jesus Look up celcus (spelling may be wrong, sirry its off the top of me head, he was Egyptian I think) the historian who commented pn Jesus's miracles. The only way he could discredit them is say they were sorcery. If Jesus's miracles were legit (not just getting people high to make it seem like it, yes I've heard that one but how did he get 10,000+ high at once at the feeding of the 5,000 (men)) who else was he?	Celsus was a second century philosopher, he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus.  If Jesus's miracles were legit (not just getting people high to make it seem like it, yes I've heard that one but how did he get 10,000+ high at once at the feeding of the 5,000 (men)) who else was he? This is an argument from ignorance, just because you don't know what happened doesn't mean you can jump to the ridiculous unlikely. We don't even know that those events occurred.	2
You may want to enlighten this dude ;) <a href='http://www.createdebate.com/user/viewprofile/TheEccentric'>http://www.createdebate.com/user/viewprofile/TheEccentric 	I've debated Christianity with him before and he certainly has some issues with the religion	2

"Those stats are not shit. Perhaps they don't reflect what happens in the game (obviously someones not gonna win the game just because their gun does 2pts more damage than everyone elses) but this doesn't mean the stats themselves are false.  As for playing online, most online FPSs haven't changed since CS; run, run, run around and headshot or get headshotted isn't fun for me anymore. I need games with strategy or a character I get to seriously develop (not just, ""oh, I unlocked a new scope""). I can do Co-op with modern FPSs but I've been bored out of playing any of the online multiplayer. So I can't really speak on most of what you just wrote as it requires knowledge of online play."	Its still fun for me to a point. I get what you mean though. Sometimes ill switch to BF3 or Madden 13. Sometimes i say fuck it and play minecraft lol.	2
One of them maybe needs thicker skin, but neither of them was stupid. Documentation is important because it's the cornerstone of bureaucracy.	Right, they need tougher skin, which why you need new friends. Documentation is not the cornerstone of bureaucracy, that would be rules and regulations.

I disagree with this i drove myself at 12 just down the street because my farther was teaching me how to drive as long as you know how to steer,you can push the peedle , and you can take directions it shouldn't be that hard. So yes 14 year olds should be able to drive. You just have to know what your doing. Yes ; every body recks even 30 year old , mature adults reck to.	I disagree with this i drove myself at 12 just down the street because my farther was teaching me how to drive as long as you know how to steer,you can push the peedle , and you can take directions it shouldn't be that hard If you disagreed with it, then I would have liked a rebuttal to my arguments, which was not provided. The fact is, even though you may think you're a responsible driver at 14 for driving down a road, there's a lot you have to learn before being able to drive. I'm assuming you didn't use turn signals, or lane indicators? The fact of the matter is, you would be a serious hazard on a highway. You don't have the experience to be driving at 14, which is why you need to be older to drive. So yes 14 year olds should be able to drive. You just have to know what your doing. Because you drove up a street means 14 year olds should be able to drive? In all likelihood, the chance of a 14-year old passing a driver's test and getting a license is slim to none without serious practice. The age restrictions are there for reasons which I have provided. Yes ; every body recks even 30 year old , mature adults reck to Yes, adults also cause car crashes, however like I said, the chances of a 14-year old crashing is much higher than, say, a 25 year old. There are too many distractions in a child's mind that could occur at any time, too many tight situations (parking would be a nightmare), and overall it is just a big waste of time for such a small result.	2

If two want to get married with the eyes of their church, then yes. Otherwise, there is no need. Marriage has only been recognized a private issue until government hijacked it.	"It became a government issue a long time ago, before ""marriage"" was the word even used. So in the eyes of history and semantics, ""marriage"" was always a government event as well as personal event."	2
"You didn't make this argument before, right? You only talked about existing, not living. But, Cartman doesn't like you when you post a challenge that you get upset with people for joining in on.

"Ja correction, I made this debate before. And don't just guess what i get upset about, I was peeved off by the fact all you were doing was saying crude and insulting things about Jean-Paul Sartre.

Thats illegal for a 16 year old to date a 19 year old the law is you have to be 18 to date someone that's 18 years old or older	Maybe in whichever country you live, but in Britain you can date someone aged 18 from about 14~ there isn't really a limit, just an average of what parents will allow. Legally, you can be in a consensual sexual relationship with anyone provided that you're both over 16.	2
The link didn't work for me... but anyways, there are cops out there who shouldn't be cops. If he just shot this guy for no apparent reason other than he was searching through a car, then the cop should be fired and maybe even locked up. Just because one cop acts one way, doesn't mean all cops are like that. I'll have to read the article to get a better idea of what happened.	Just because one cop acts one way, doesn't mean all cops are like that. True. It just seems like there's a whole lot of unjust police brutality going on these days.

I can definitely imagine you in office! You'd be one of those crazy senators proposing bills to outlaw things like horse-on-goat sex, or pickled peanuts or something.	Actually my first bill would outlaw pancake hats on bunnies ;)	2
Well if one looks at it all animals are nothing but a mass of energy of various accounts being manipulated to satisfy a need a want which is to survive as long as it can, and to survive a living organism has to be able to learn from mistakes and be able to adapt, so in theory if man is smart enough to come up with an algorithm as stated by someone earlier for a robot or machine to have want and need to survive that should be all that's needed for it to be able to start becoming sentient beings. This is just a guess out of the air so idk.	That is majorly convoluted but I think I almost understand what you just said. In which case, I think I agree.	2

That's not how the world works. If I tell you that if you punch me, I'll kill you, and then you punch me, and I kill you, you have not killed yourself: I have killed you. There is no middle ground simply because it is the actions of a government.	That's not how the world works. If I tell you that if you punch me, I'll kill you, and then you punch me, and I kill you, you have not killed yourself: I have killed you. I can definitely agree to that. But don't you think that someone who is well aware of the action/consequence nature of living anywhere with a government somewhat loses out on their ability to complain and appeal when facing the consequences for their actions? The post you're disputing isn't one i agree with, but this is what I took from it.	2
I have seen people work, looks like they are already on a holiday. They don't need another one.	This does logically constitute as not 'everyone' needing a week's worth of vacation. Because of the way the question is worded, I agree with you.	2

It's usually considered victory when the opponent is forced to withdraw, isn't it?	The opponent must force them to withdraw.  Besides, both of them would have to withdraw. The only difference is that superman would take shelter in space and Goku would teleport to another planet.	2

Disclaimer: I have zero formal education on the topic. However, I have an opinion, just like everyone else ;) Fiat money has created a disposable society. Your iPhone is disposable. It is not cost effective to fix it and you'll be lusting over the new iPhone a few months after buying one. With a commodity based standard, we probably wouldn't able to afford to change standards as quickly as we do. For example, moving from vinyl to tape to CDs to DVDs, etc. It just wouldn't be cost effective. With a commodity based standard, things should slow down. People would be able to keep a job for decades, instead of years. This means that people would be able to retire from one company. When (if) I retire, I will be collecting a little from every company I've ever worked for. On the down side, economic down turns would last longer and the gap between rich and poor could widen even more. But I'm just talking out my ass because my mouth knows better ;)	I suppose slower growth and a smaller economy does has its benefits. Never really thought of it that way.	2
Is there anything particularly wrong with having a healthy fear of death? I too love a good challenge. I just rather that challenge not involve being eaten by some wild animal.	I'm more into the death by savage animal route. Something more appealing than dying slowly due to this anxiety induced society of overworking slaves.	2
"How true this is. Religion doesn't have to be based upon God, it can be based upon a god. Albert Einstein once was asked what his religion was and his answer is as follows; ""My work is my religion, I work religiously."" Whatever is the center of your life is your religion. One's god can be almost anything. For some that god is alcohol, gambling, drugs, work, sex, computer games, etc. If you worship it, it is your god."	"Whatever is the center of your life is your religion. being someone opposed to worship, I don't regard anything as being ""the center of my life"" This does not preclude me however from practicing and reaping the benefits of deep devotion. The efforts that evidence my devotions is how I express religion. though I may not identify wholeheartedly with any particular religious sect I identify with many of them in some ways. I think atheists (a group I embarrassingly belong to) ought to shut up with the anti-religious rhetoric because it amounts to saying: Our system of belief has lead us to believe that some systems of beliefs are objectionable. Well no shit? How about a little more devotion to describing why non-theism is a good philosophical base for religious practice?"	2

"Yah, love doesn't need a god. Love is more pure when it doesn't need a god. I mean, if love needs a god, then is all things an atheist loves just false love? You could say ""It comes from god"" and try to tell them they're wrong, but you can't prove it. It's just occam's razor, isn't it? Either love is from god, to your dog, or it's simply from your dog. It's more pure the second way, without a god. Not that this has anything to do with the existence of a god, but still, I don't think god = love.  I think love = love."

And to what you said, yes. That is confirmed in the Bible.	Yes what? It was a why question, not yes or no. As for my sins, they are all finite.

Because computers can only work in base 2. So it only makes sense to use base 2 when measuring their size.	"But kilo should just mean one thing regardless of what you're counting.

"The animals were created ""after their kind"" man was not. Animals evolved, man did not. I believe this because of both biblical and scientific reasons. Animals were created in the same manner as Adam and Eve. Plants grew without rain (illogical). In fact you cannot be correct. Animals came after Adam. They spawned. That is incredibly illogical."	"Animals were not created the same way. God formed man from the dust and breathed life. Animals were made from the water and land, but not formed, the different animals came from ""after their kind"" aka macro-evolution. I believe you are referring to Genesis 2 with the rain? All that says is God prepared the dust before he made the rest of creation."	2

THATS THE POINT, we don't know anything wheter life itself is a lie, whether it's true.. we don't know therefore we don't know if ice cream, religion, language exists.	"That is a CONCLUSION you appear to have come to, and I am suggesting that it's based on clearly invalid logic. While much of what we call knowledge is bound to be invalidated, this by no means means that none of our knowledge is true and reliable. There is a point where questions of existentialism cross the line between healthy philosophical contemplation and [remove pejorative] something else entirely. In doubting the existence of ice cream and language, and wondering about ""whether life itself is a lie"" I think you have crossed that line.

I hope that CEO didn't get in trouble. Won't liberals claim they were unfairly targeted and consider it discrimination?	He owns the company. Ownership has its privileges ;)	2
just like 4 building a castel u nid a gud foundation live vise grammar is a foundation to buil n improve our communication	Grammar is skeleton of the body it gives shape to our communication skills	2
I don't think you should ban any. But either that or ban all. Anything else is unfair.	Yeah... I wanted that to be an option but until Andy gives us three way debates... I'm at a loss.	2
I like this song , i like this clip . But its been done many times , Not the song itself , but the style of song and clip. Even so i enjoyed it. Dont some guys look great in dresses.	I'm not sure these are the guys that look great in dresses. :)	2
Yeah if other people stayed banned things would be better but other new trolls could spawn and try to mess things up.	Yes, just like the old Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie, they spawn and spawn til all you can do is yawn and yawn and <a href='http://media.tumblr.com/2d6fd332e5d93b86815c349742dcc788/tumblr_inline_mru2sc8SLC1qz4rgp.gif#funny%20invasion%20of%20the%20body%20snatchers%20gif%20500x375'>hope the nightmare will one day end, LOL	2
Doesn't Obamacare lead to the same problems with insurance? Except for the leper who has the previous condition. We will still have to pay deductibles. There will still be operations that aren't medically needed.	Mmm... I'll have to look up what obamacare means. I like the NHS system in Britain where our taxes pay for the upkeep of hospitals, so everyone can afford healthcare.	2
"And the people who refuse to use the term ""Christmas""... come on, give me a break! It's a word. It's what the majority of the world calls it. You don't have to sing about Jesus, you can stick with Santa or just put up a tree, whatever, but the name is what it is."	So you don't like it when someone wishes you Happy Holidays? What does it really matter?	2
Because the way you originally put it didn't tell how it was in preparation of becoming impoverished it was just a statement of how if you were in that shoes you'd want people to help. Which is empathy and it's a moral reason.	I said if you happen to one day end up in their shoes, literally, you would know have more power to demand empathy FROM THEM. (see what I'm saying?)	2
So you believe that something can not come from nothing, no? Thus, who/what created God?	I believe that God is imortal, he never ended or began. But you believe, that there is no God or anything. But in the end, there has to be SOMETHING that created everything. I mean, it can't be made by nothing. You believe its nothing, I believe it's God. God is the source I believe created everything. What is your source?	2
Of course is manipulative, that is how big politics works now, right or wrong.  But i don't think it is smart to be talking about the issue immediatly after such a tradgey like the shooting takes place. It is like going to the grocrey store when you are hungry, you over commentate on how you are feeling at that exact moment, and may come to regret it later on.	Yeah I agree. There is a line to be crossed if one is going to take advantage of an incident, and it may be hard to gauge, but generally not in the wake of the incident. Of course every major news station crosses that line, because it gets people riled up and raises their numbers. It's advantageous and imprudent.	2
I go with the ban all option. I don't like seeing that uncomfortable crap. Maybe not as severe as ban all, but to an extent. Show some modesty people.	Actually... I agree... it's awkward as fuck no matter if it's a guy and a girl or two dudes.... (two girls? LOL)	2
What do you mean?	"People always say that Republicans are the worse of two parties, I never knew anything you pointed out. Me ""screwing knowledge"" allows me to be ignorant about this in all ways  so I can be about my business."	2

Even if it's true, it's less the belief that there is no god, and more the lack of belief that there's a god. Lacking a belief in one direction does prove a belief in the other.	Damn auto-correct ;)  OK, I fixed it. I think you are describing agnosticism. Atheists are dead sure there's not God ;)	2
Their was none. I know it was terrible. Theirs no denying this, I don't believe it to be right either. Sorta contradicts the love commandment. But where is this happenning today?	Just because you guys have calmed down and stopped killing innocent people everything should be ok? What guarantees do I have that something like that won't happen tomorrow, or in a year?	2
Outside of the divine creation of man, does or does not the Bible line up with the big bang and evolution?	"Well not really, I can see how people can come up with ""well God did it"" because we have no proof of knowing what happen before the big bang or what created the elements for the big bang to even happen in the first place, however just because we don't know it's not logical to say ""See it must be God because we don't know"" Now as for everything being created in 7 days, one could argue with a scientific view point in this way ""now this is pure speculation"" but one can argue that at the moment of the big bang time itself was compacted ""seeing as how space and time are intertwined"", so 7 days when space and time was no bigger then a football field time was accelerated so 7 days back then would equal 14.5 billions years now seeing as how the universe is expanding and time stretches with space itself. But we have no proof of that or if that is even possible scientifically, so in the end we have to stick to the facts that we know as if now, and now we have no proof of God as a creator, but it does not mean there might not be one."	2
there is scientific evidence that states that it is good to our health and affects us positively. What pseudo science says that?	I do recall watching a documentary on netflix (I forget the name) where a professor did a study/research on the effects of prayer. Prayer itself has the potential to put religious people in some meditative mental state, of which the effects although not huge can be positive. Although, this can be achieved through meditation without the use of prayer as well... My apologies for no source.	2
atheism is religion? ... so tell me how many atheist churches are in your neighborhood?	You have to address disputes to a specific person, I can tell that you're new, but the way to do it is to pick a comment from their side and choose dispute. It will count to your side and will also address them.	2
I used to be a pessimist, but then I got pessimistic about being a pessimist.	I was once pessimistic about being a pessimist but my optimism for it convinced me to revert.	2
Yes I believe they will burn in hell if they don't make that choice. If they choose not to believe in God then they send themselves to hell due to what they choose out of free will.	And that is exactly why your beliefs/opinions should not be respected. Everyone has free will, as do you. You have chosen to believe that those who are not of the same opinions or beliefs will burn in hell forever. Since you can choose to believe differently, since you can change you opinions, not only your beliefs but also you do not deserve respect.	2
I would imagine that no uranium product would enter the public domain without employing the utmost security. The argument I gave for kilograms of uranium regarded the possibility of extracting said uranium for mischievous or malevolent purposes, and that, would be the main concern. As I understand it's illegal to possess uranium; what would it mean for a drug cartel to invest a few million into your uranium devices, and extract the contents. Furthermore, the legal, military, and ethical complications would be astronomical.	AHA! AND THAT IS WHERE I HAVE YOU! I have a perfect, err, well, Near Perfect design for the utmost safety of the item in question. Although I cant tell you the design, what if I told you that it could avoid all of those in that it gives off nuclear ower with no chance of ever detonating or being extracted? The Legal part, actually, might be the hardest part, especially with the more Liberal parties. It all kinda depends on how well I can convince you of all people with my claims of absolute safety right on the face of it. For that is the most charismatic part of the whole plan in that its a wondertool. Going to second guess me?	2
I believe that God means for us to help others. How we do it is up to us. God expects us to provide for the needy. This does not include helping those who won't work and support themselves. My example is from Deuteronomy 24:19-22.  19 When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 20 When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. 21 When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. 22 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.	Funny thing, is that your god isn't my god.  So, maybe it's only your god who wants universal health care. But that brings up the question, if he wanted us to have it so bad, why don't we already have it? Better yet, why didn't he just make us in a way where we wouldn't need health care at all? Ah, the cruel christian god strikes back...	2
"I prefer to use the words evidence for instead of proof of but I agree with what you said.  I never understood religious people's problems with evolution either because they could so easily argue that no matter how things came to be or evolved over time- ""God"" gets the credit. I guess that some of the ones who take the Bible word for word can't see that there's room for both (creation and evolution) but That's how I have reconciled the two for myself."	A big reason to why some religious try to deny the reality of evolution is, because of the story of Adam and Eve. Some Christians believe the literal story of that, evolution contradicts that. This is why some Christians are so vehemently against evolution. However in my opinion reality should come before belief, and if one really feels that they have to give up a little of their belief to accept reality, they should. The story of Adam and Eve doesn't have to be taken literally and if not accepting it literally is what it takes to not deny reality then that should be expected from them.	2
Not that I disagree with Peekaboo, all of those things ARE ruining the world. But, homophobia could be the start of something huge that could possibly ruin the world. Like Hitler with the Jewish people. All he had to do was convince a few people that the Jews caused everything. What happens when a new homophobic Hitler decides the LGBT's are the cause of everything?	That is true. I think the chances of a new Hitler rising to power are pretty slim, because since WWII we have become so much more aware of the danger of allowing democracy and human rights to be eroded. Even minor (relatively speaking) human rights abuses by Western powers draw frenzied criticism. But then, I don't suppose many people in the early 20th century had predicted Hitler's rise and actions. A regional Hitler oppressing a particular nation I can easily imagine though - in fact you can argue it's happening right now, in regards to women's rights and gay rights in some Middle Eastern countries.	2
Well, it's your girlfriend that causes all the drama.	LOL! Dana isn't my girlfriend.  	2

Pathetic. Absolutely shameful lol!	2

"2700 replies Bohemian...you're even citing websites? Nice... I won't be taking that much time to explain to people that this ""rock"" is much older than 2000 years...or even 200 years old.

"Yes, you've gotta love the ""But we had a lot of snow last year"" argument, it never fails to amuse."	2
It was meant as a humourous remark; however, if you wanted to incite hatred against the conservatives, what better way is there than to give liberals a tangible example of conservatism at it's worst.	I'd be downright ashamed at the lunacy of Glenn Beck if I were a conservative. He can and does single-handedly devalue the entirety of the conservative beliefs. Everyday he tries so hard to falsely correlate the dissociated knowledge of ignorant Americans. The sad part is that he succeeds, and incredibly so. Because of this, he has the leverage and power to start an ignorant revolution. He is a threat to the very people whom worship the ground on which he walks.	2
Define;Atheism Putting that into good search will come up with the one that I got, so, it looks like we're going to be at a standstill because of that.	Or we could look at the way the term is used and why there are multiple definitions, and argue the logic of which fits best for the general definition. Otherwise it's simply an argument from authority.	2
Typical south of France weather, very sunny and hot and things..!	You are in France? :)	2
Easy to answer  No Jesus did not convert  but if I tell you he was born a muslim you;ll respond islam did not exist at the time of jesus  but then if i tell you Jesus had submitted himself to the creator or god or master or the father of existence..... you'll most likely recognize that then first answer  well if you translate word muslim in english with a definition....  it means to submit to the law or commendment of the creator or GOD or the father of existance. therefore Jesus was a muslim from the start because jesus prayed as muslims  did... u can c bible (matthew 26:39) i have more bible verses of jesus praying upon request  maybe the word islam did not exist at the time of jesus but the religion of submitting to the 1 GOD(which means islam in arabic) Definately existed without any doubt or question.	I believe you. Jesus was a Muslim and then when he wanted to convert to Christianity, he got nailed for it ;)	2
"See, I'm glad you brought up this case, because it highlights perfectly the most recent death penalty debate from last week. The fact is, all they have in this case are witnesses the other fact is, eye witnesses are exactly the worst kind of witness on earth. There's tons of articles on it, I've heard most studies putting the accuracy just over 50%. YOU MIGHT AS WELL FLIP A COIN! Here's 28 cases where the winessess just knew they had the right guy, and guess what, they didn't <a href='http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/~glwells/editorialnjlawjrnl.htm'>link Every single year dozens of people are put to death who science later find as innocent. So what the hell is the point? Besides some blood lust? Listen, if someone kills a loved one of mine, sure, I'd want revenge. But society has to step away from instincts like that. It's the job of the courts to hold themselves aloof from human emotion and to deal with facts of cases. The facts are, 1. We are wrong way too often about guilt and innocence to morrally justify condemning one to death. 2. The death penalty costs more money than life in prison to the tax payer. So why do we do it? I'll tell you why, because these shitty politicians, they're close enough to the issues to know it's bs, but they pander to simpletons. It sounds good ""you kill in TEXAS, guess what Ya'll we kill you back!"" well yeeha cowboy, meanwhile we're killing a bunch of people who didn't do shit, and these politicians keep getting re-elected by sounding tough on crime, when they're really just wasing tax-payer money, and of course killing the innocent along with the guilty."	"Hi David! When I was a P.I. (about 6 years) I often took ""eye-witness"" reports from innocent bystanders! I would have put the figure much lower than 50% from what I could see. People are clueless in eye-witness testimony especially when you must pressure them into an answer of any kind. I had one guy tell me once that the person in question was between 5'5"" and 6' 1"" at about 150-210 lbs and was Black. Turned out he was 5'3"" at 125 lbs and was Italian with Olive skin tones!!! I'd throw 'em all in the river, they are the worst things to go by. I could write a book on crap like this."	2

I think he may have cooled recently as I have stopped making as many arguments as I am getting kind of bored of this website. But when I used to make a lot of arguments I would always get downvoted on almost every argument and when I went to JakeJ's award points page I would see he downvoted an argument in the debate in question at the time mine was downvoted. And of course he would most often never respond.	Not responding is one of his three worst traits! He often gets too angry to respond properly.	2
That is definately true, but I still do not think it is going to happen. NK is to small with to little amount of allies, compared to the US. Both countries could start WWIII but something could happen to another country that could start a WWIII but I think that it will not be in the next 10 years.	NK is small, but it only take one atomic weapon detonation to spark something that snowballs into WWIII.	2
"Wow! Glad to see that someone else recognizes the actualities and implications of a fiat currency. (All deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of the United States.) FDIC insurance! Fractional Reserve lending. Again I am impressed! How about this: Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar?  ""If people of the United States understood the banking system I believe there would be a revolution over-night."" --A paraphrased quote by Henry Ford"	Never heard that quote before but thats good from Henry Ford. People just don't know if they took the time to unveil the truth there probably would be a revolution.	2
Yes, that is true. Most of the kills Stalin was credited with came from starvation. This is terrible, but it is not deliberately killing in a programme. Yes, some of the starvation deaths were a deliberate programme, but not all.  Furthermore, things got better after Stalin for a bit. After Hitler they would get worse. Imagine someone like Hydrich or Himmler in power.	Stalin did orchestrate many famines. What about to kolak scare? Things never got better with Stalin in most of the occupied regions, some benefits arose but most of them came from the war ending and not having everything burned when either side would fall backr.	2

Are we talking Batman/Ironman or Bruce Wayne/Tony Stark? Bruce Wayne any day of the week, but Batman? Batman's a vengeful angry vigilante who operates outside of the law to get what he wants done. If it's between Batman and Ironman, I have to go with Ironman - he's less crazy.	"If we had followed Batmans philosophy we would never have invaded Iraq: Batman: ""Nobody wants war."" Robin: ""Gee, Batman. Belgravia's such a small country. We'd beat them in a few hours."" Batman: ""Yes, and then we'd have to support them for years."" --- Batman is only a vigilantly because he knows Washington is corrupt and can't be trusted to stop crime. He is a very noble guy."	2
"I agree with you, but what do you mean by ""temporarily""? Temporarily, while one of them find boyfriend( girlfriend)? Or another reasons? Why friendship between man and woman can not be forever?"	I mean that when you will find your love, I believe that you are separated from each other.	2

Atheism: The theory or belief that God does not exist. Religion: The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods. By the definitions atheism is the polar opposite of religion, but on a more realistic note, since definitions are often too cut and dry, atheism is too not believe in god. Religion is organization of people who believe in god to worship. Atheists do no worship, they simply refuse to believe.	"Wrong again.  Atheists believe that they are right and that ""they"" are wrong.  Sorry man/woman/whatever the fuck you are, atheism brings to the table nothing different than what those whom do believe bring to the table; and that is that they choose to believe in what they believe in.  Atheism - DO not believe in any god to exist (IN GENERAL TERMS) Theism - DO believe in any, or one, god to exist (IN GENERAL TERMS)  You're as organized as any other cultural or societal way of living.  Do NOT clump together a people(s) and claim atheist are not clumped together as well.  There are agendas to both sides of the story, do not fucking claim otherwise or you're as false as a person saying ""Does sound exist without an ear drum/sound receptive value present?""  Atheist may not worship, however they fucking drool over the argument against the idea that no god exists because they've got no reason to believe themselves.  Has NOTHING to do with those whom believe.  This has everything to do with those whom do not believe, AKA atheists; atheism battles against themselves, just as ""religious"" people battle amongst themselves in terms of ""we are right, you are wrong"".  You're not fucking special."	2

Taking pictures and putting them in magazines for the entire world to watch against your will is most certainly a violation of privacy.	Not really. If you walk into a public area you follow public rules. If I take an image I only have to blur out things that can endanger you like license plate. In public if I record a video I can record you walking down the steet because you are in public view. Police watch you with camera in public but a civilian can't? Both parties can. Why? Its the public.	2
I'm 17 so I don't pay taxes yet. But I think we get paid more, so it equals out. Minimum wage UK (over 21) £6.19($9.50) USA $7.25 (£4.72)	Maybe so. Do your parents have a hard time affording things because of taxes?	2
Well, considering the adage comes from the Hebrew Bible, I would say no. The cultural values reflected in the phrase are no longer applicable in this day and age. It'd be just like supporting any kind of religious law in this country; it's not compatible with our Constitution or theories of social psychology. I think any legal system based on such a statement would propagate more dissidence than we already have. The same sentiment is the basis for Hammurabi's code in ancient Babylon. But under his code, the penalty for stealing was the removal of the criminal's hand. That's not even really logical. The removal of a hand should be the punishment for removing another person's hand. So then what's the punishment for theft? Seizure of property from the thief? How effectively would that work? It'd be tyrannical.	It seems like you're talking mostly about whether America could do it, but what about other nations? I don't see anything wrong with your points, they are very good. Just wondering whether you think it would work elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, they cut off people's hands if they steal still, and many people think that is acceptable, but elsewhere (most of the world) it isn't. And it's not necessarily to do the exact same to someone else, but could be seen as something equal and fair. (In my opinion, I don't see the act of chopping someone's hands off as fair in any way)	2

1. If someone has a problem with homosexuals having a civil union they will most likely have a problem with them being married. This is true, but they won't know if they are gay or straight when they read 'married' on their drivers license or whereever they had to put it. 2. A title is meaningless, its just words on paper. Regardless of the words on paper a marriage and civil union are the same thing. So why can't they have this useless title, if it's not harming anyone? there is no law separating the two groups. I can't really think of any other examples of being in a civil union being as discriminated against except for job opportunities.	This is true, but they won't know if they are gay or straight when they read 'married' on their drivers license or wherever they had to put it. Can I ask how old you are? Because most people know you don't put your relationship status on your drivers license. Actually, it really doesn't go anywhere except on face book. Some jobs ask if you have a family to know how easy it would be to relocate you, but thats about it.  So why can't they have this useless title, if it's not harming anyone? I never said they couldn't. I'm against all government intervention when it comes to marriage, I just found the cartoon (and the cartoonist) to be misleading. I can't really think of any other examples of being in a civil union being as discriminated against except for job opportunities. Again, most jobs don't ask for your relationship status or sexuality, some just want to know if you have a family because of relocation, travel and overtime.	2
We follow our own moral's because we can think for ourselves. Thewayitis is no more than a bigoted, and ignorant troll. Apparently your christian morality is fairly flawed or doesn't work too well because if you look at history, belief in your god, and gods in general is one of the leading causes of death. People killing each other left and right because god told them it would be a good idea. I don't trust any words coming from a book that tells me to stone my neighbor if he dares to pick up sticks on Sunday. And because i can guess you don't do the same as good old moral moses did when he stoned that heretic who picked up sticks, therefore you don't even follow christian morals, so apparently you have your own set of moral rules but condemn others for thinking on their own because their morals don't have a root in one of many archaic texts. Learn to think you hypocritical bigot.	"Although I agree with the spirit in which your argument was written, I have hit the 'dispute' button. ""we can think for ourselves"" An excellent quality in all--atheists and theists alike. Thinking for yourself allows you to question what you're taught and find truth, even if it's hidden in falsehood. ""People killing each other left and right because god told them it would be a good idea."" This is half-true. Most of those times, people killed people because they wanted to, and justified it by saying it was their god(s)' will. Others, they misinterpreted God's will, and killed anyway (e.g. Hitler). ""I don't trust any words coming from a book that tells me to stone my neighbor if he dares to pick up sticks on Sunday."" ""Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days a week are set apart for your daily duties and regular work, but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to the LORD your God."" Just a minor technicality, the seventh day is the Sabbath, not the first. Look at the Jews. They've been keeping track of this forever, so they probably have the right day. ----- But other than those, I wholeheartedly agree with you. Free thought is an amazing thing. Sadly, so many people lack that capacity."	2
"Its possible. So is his original claim. Yet, knowing politicians, I'd go with my claim over yours. So his claims could still be true and or false. Still doesn't change that he was elected for his ideals  Yes, he was elected for his ideals: ""Change"" and ""Hope"". He found to words and started throwing them around and gaining a following. o.O I've always wondered: What does this mean? Especially since that same man isn't going to change anything any faster than Obama Prove it. Obama mayn't be the perfect man which he's made out to be. Only it could go vice versa or Obama could go 10 times faster than this supposed new guy, or the other way around! You just don't know. That's just it, you don't know; thus, why should we heed his demands for reelection when his opponent may be better - or, of course, he may be worse. And in order to complete the goal he got elected for he needs the second term. How do you know that he actually has those goals in mind?"	"Yet, knowing politicians, I'd go with my claim over yours.

"Hehehe, no worries now ;)  Hey, if you're really stuck, try these. Make some debates about: "" Proof as to why dinosaurs were alive 4,000 years ago (Bible says so..)""  "" Why all Palestinians are terrorists."" ""Why Religion is peaceful and atheism causes terror."" ""Why homosexuals should be cured."" Or something like that, I mean any one of those and you're sure to piss me off :P"	Thanks for the help. :)	2
No I am not talking about the debate question, I am talking about the question that leads to Agnostics and Atheists revealing their ideology.	Ohhh, okay. Well, I guess since I don't know, I can't answer that question. I don't really know if I believe. I haven't been given a reason too, but I'm not set in that state of mind, and I acknowledge the potential and likelihood for God to exist.  I'm in the middle.  It's sort of like this (in terms of belief in God):  ATHEIST-------------------AGNOSTIC----------------------CHRISTIAN	2
I've not heard of thundercats either... is it an American thing?	OMG, what do they teach in school these days? :) Yes, ThunderCats was an American cartoon that ran from 1985-1989, and a rebooted version aired from 2011-2012. I don't know if the episodes were aired in other countries, but they're now available on DVD and YouTube. They also have comic books and action figures. There was supposed to be a 2010 CGI/animated movie, but it was put on hold.	2

1. Inevitable domestic disputes are going to be exponentially harder to resolve, the more spouses you bring to the marriage. This would involve custody disputes, parental visitation rights, property rights, employee benefits, insurance claims, etc. It's complicated enough with only two people in a marriage.  2. Let's say Dana meets a man at the mall and wants to cheat on both of us and she brings us home a little present in the form of a pregnancy, aids or some other VD. Or, let's say Dana falls in love with two or three other married couples and wants in on their marriages but we don't want any part of it. Would we have a right to deny Dana her other marriage wants?	 Inevitable domestic disputes are going to be exponentially harder to resolve, the more spouses you bring to the marriage. This would involve custody disputes, parental visitation rights, property rights, employee benefits, insurance claims, etc. It's complicated enough with only two people in a marriage.  Now I think it would be easier. Because instead of having 10 marriages, with two people in each, you have maybe 6 marriages, with 3-4 in each. Let's say Dana meets a man at the mall and wants to cheat on both of us and she brings us home a little present in the form of a pregnancy, aids or some other VD. That can happen in a two-people marriage too, so that's an invalid argument. Or, let's say Dana falls in love with two or three other married couples and wants in on their marriages but we don't want any part of it. Would we have a right to deny Dana her other marriage wants? No, Dana gets a divorce, whilst we stay married.	2

"""And that is true in the short run, however over the long run you will see institutions which coin money changing their standards, more gold mined, other metals substituting for gold and so on.""  I'd like to request the source of your information for this statement. Because in my reading of economic history of the past 5000 years, it's been governments who seek out less expensive metals over time, not the minting companies, not the industry. Only governments can force people to accept this metal swapping for same value. Only governments can force people to accept this fraud; the classic bait and switch.  Gersham's law - ""Bad money drives out good money if the exchange rate is set by law"". You see, it's nearly impossible to make people accept something as something else. You can't force people to accept a knockoff if there are other competitors who offer the real deal. To block out competitors is by definition a monopoly, which is IMPOSSIBLE in a free market. Even predatory pricing and such will injure, cripple or maim a company attempting it. Only government can create monopolies (joining of economics and state), and by definition, government IS a monopoly and MUST be a monopoly. You can't have two conflicting constitutions in the same community (prelude to anarchy)."	My main info is goverments, as for private minting companies i'm not very familiar with them. However you can be sure that where there is profit to be made, they will go there if they can. Consider this:  1. All the oil wells are owned by once company which got there by merging, having lower prices, and so on, what is to stop them from doing such in a free market?  2. Once they own all the wells, what is to stop them from maintaining their monopoly on oil, a needed item?	2
If I understand Szechuan's argument correctly, then it's not a question of whether we should have an army or not, but rather 'should we have an offensive army or not'. Mind you, the Swede's do have an army -- it's just not a standing army, it's a militia. And a conscripted one at that. I fully support the notion of a conscripted militia. There are few more powerful defenses than to have an nearly entire nation's males trained to fight war. And the affect of conscription does great things for national pride as well as endowing individuals with useful skills (navigation, self-defense, leadership). Having said that, we're in no position to abolish the army now. It will be several decades before we could work ourselves into a position diplomatically that would allow us to remove troops and support from around the world.	"""It will be several decades before we could work ourselves into a position diplomatically that would allow us to remove troops and support from around the world."" I don't think I follow you. Will our allies be angry with us for removing bases from their lands?  I don't think so. They might even be glad that we can begin to lower our deficit by not pouring so much money into military spending. I think our allies would prefer the US have a strong economy than a strong military presence in their country... In addition, it would improve diplomacy with countries that don't like us so much - like Palestine, Iran..."	2

Wait? Are you calling me a troll? Or Srom? I mean, I pretty much am a troll but not because of this debate.... I'm just posting what Srom said because it's one of the most f*cking ridiculous things I've ever heard on the internet.	I know you're a troll... I'm talking about srom. And yeah, it is very fucking ridiculous. Even if one is religious should still have the brains to recognize that big nonsense. The deepest drilled hole: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole  Nothing about the screaming voices of hell.

I could have a bias for Minecraft, but that sounds awful. Are there any mods, or people making custom maps, or mini-games. Can you make a working virtual computation device in Roblox?  In Minecraft people create visual art, recreations of places real or imagined. Also people who make songs out of note blocks are amazing. I know I'm biased as all hell, and am too lazy to do research, because this debate is just asking what we play I don't have to prove anything. It's just my opinion. Is Roblox worth looking into?	I think Roblox isn't worth looking into. Its alright at some points and at others it fails to meet their needs. Anybody can join the site but its mostly people who are kids on that site that play that and there is some people who play it who are a lot older. They have strict moderators because they want to make it kid friendly.  I own minecraft as well and think its a lot better then Roblox.	2

Puerto Rico has a rich culture and a way of doing things that would not be supported by the citizens of Puerto Rico. Though it would be a great benefit for the people to receive the financial aid that the United States could bring, but Puerto Rico operates at an almost normal state without America’s limited command. The majority of the population would not vote for a Governor that would even consider ruining the culture and heritage of Puerto Rico’s great history, and for most Puerto Ricans the thought of being ran by “Gringos” isn’t a very good idea. In my opinion Puerto Rico staying a commonwealth is perfectly fine as it and the U.S. involvement with Puerto Rico is at its farthest point and Americans should not push for anything more than Puerto Rico as a commonwealth, unless anything gets worse.

"There are a lot of logical arguments for stupid design- the physical fallibility of the human body (breathing/eating from one hole=suffocation) making it easy for us to needlessly die, which therefore leeches at the legitimacy that we were made by something ""intelligent"". This line of reasoning appears to be confusing perfect design with intelligent design. Just because there are some minor setbacks does not mean the design, as a whole, is inadequate. If having those body parts next to each other was really a flaw in the design, then why has the population just continued to increase? If it was really as big a flaw as that line of reasoning is making it out to be, then the human population would be a lot smaller. So I think that that is a terrible argument for stupid design."

Just because they are going to have the largest economy in 30 years and have the largest military doesn't mean anything. The question is- Can they maintain a large economy and military while still being able to handle a huge population?	China has a huge population, which would be an asset, except that it's a huge AGING population, which is a serious liability. Thanks to the one-child policy, China has fast-tracked itself to developing nation status, but the cost is it has fast-tracked itself to the largest developed nation problem i.e. an aging population. In 5-10 years expect there to be serious questions about the sustainability of China's health care programs, and consequently the sustainability of it's economy and social order.	2
NASCAR is an sport, but it really should be reduced to merely as a spectator sport.	Well yea, it's hard to get into NASCAR. I mean, you can try to get there but most people fail at it.  Even the rookie NASCAR driver has 100's of hours of racing below their belt. Most NASCAR drivers started racing when they were in their teens, some younger in go-karts. I support your comment.

What does paying bills and taking care of yourself have to do with what you believe in? That was a totally nonsensical answer.

When i was younger, i think i had POCD. It is about fearing of becoming a pedophile. I posted a debate about whether or not i should see the psychologist and there were comments that were helpful. Please don't think i promote the harm on children. I personally do not think it is fair on those children to be hurt. And this explains a lot of my pedophilia debates and whether it was right or wrong.  I think CreateDebate is a wacked up family in a good way. And i do think we should help each other out.  And to be honest, that may kinda not make this site more professional. But it makes it more heart warming.	"Not like the run of the mill perspective debate.

because you have stress work out, eat healthier, meditate, read a book. These are just a few ideas. There are plenty of other alternatives for you to relieve stress that don't increase your chances of getting lung cancer. because you're bored oh come on... seriously? Do you live all alone in the middle of Antarctica or something? I was under the impression this debate was about cigarettes, smoking cigarettes is not something I would consider entertaining. something to do when you're waiting for a ride I guess that falls along with boredom. Read a book while you wait or listen to music. If you don't have any, then kick a rock or something lol.  it's something people do to be social something about smelly people who continually blow smoke in my face seems to drive my away. nicotine is pleasing So is not having cancer. and many more reasons like if you want all of your clothes to smell like rotten ass smoke, have yellow teeth, waste over a thousand dollars each year on something that is killing you, or if you just want to spend the last few years of your life 90 pounds underweight and hooked up to an oxygen machine 24/7, then yeah... I guess smoking is worth it.	Funny how true it is. I personally haven't even tried smoking, and never will for all the above reasons and more.	2
I still have my job, and I know of no people losing there's. My home is still affordable, and I'm doing well.

Explain...........................................................	Drug use is strictly voluntary especially in the market. Nobody forces anybody to take drugs except individuals. Government only tries to regulate individual freedom and people behavior due to its health affects, but alcohol and cigarettes are legal drugs, what is the difference, which in turn it creates drug cartels, and government protects drug cartels by the illegality of drugs. Thus, it creates a black market. Black markets cause artificially high prices.	2
He didn't mention anything about the origin of the universe.	Right. Earth wasn't made the way the bible states. It doesn't go poof and then bam. It was just a rock. Then meteors brought elements such as oxygen and hydrogen and other stuff. Then we had the earth.	2

Just because you haven't had a debate that ended good on here doesn't mean it's impossible. I have had debates where I left with a feeling that I had learned something.	This is very true. I don't debate to win, I debate to learn if my positions are correct, and the easiest way to determine that is by having other people demonstrate positions I believe to be false, demonstrate my positions are false, or for them to propose positions I hadn't even considered.	2

Nah but i dont really care because 1) dont believe heaven or hell exist so it's irrelavant. 2) why the fuck would i want to get into heaven? Oh, good. 1) great 2) Why the fuck are you asking me about wanting to go to a place you believe doesn't exist? 5 Stupid Things About Heaven 1. It's apparently really hard to get there. Well not anymore :D In fact, now that atheists are allowed into heaven Jesus may be a redundant figure in their whole religion. :) I really do like implosions they don't happen much anymore... Except for maybe the U.S economy. The admissions policy is kinda fucked Just kinda. you might not like your neighbors Why wouldn't i like my neighbors? I mean the living dead are so cute and cuddly and they'd just fall apart without me! ~pictures a zombie losing its hand and him stitching it back on and while the zombie nibbles on his cranium in absolute glee~ There isn't much to do, from the sound of it Nope! apparently an eternity serving God without the need for food and water or the need to pee and poo is as good as it gets... and i really like to poo. it lasts forever o.O Oh no you didnt. You didn't just go there. lol I'm just playin'... yup :) the after life lasts for ever apparently. Preferably I'd rather have it be my way. That being that when you die, it is incredibly and almost indistinguishably similar to being unconscious.  Except you don't ever wake up.  I mean, I could potentially prove that death is exactly that. You see, if you cut off the oxygen supply to the brain by taking a few deep breaths and holding both jugular vanes closed you will infact be starving the brain of oxygen. You will fall unconscious however, instead of dieing right then and there you will wake up momentarily because your body goes limp and you naturally release the vanes.  But because your brain can live up to 10 minutes without oxygen on a sort of standby mode for a lack of better terms you will see that you have just technically died and lived to tell the tale. I personally like to compare this to a beheading. You know a good clean slice. One of those one's where you probably don't feel a thing. Not that it's particularly relevant. Just interesting to think about. Anyway, I digress; It compares to a beheading in the sense that those jugular vanes are no longer transferring blood in much the same way as I stated above. The only difference. Well, you wont be coming back. :D	2

"For once I find myself agreeing with RandomDude. I've been in a church of several Christian denominations and never seen a ""holy"" Bible that was just the NT. I've never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the NT. And I know that most Christians embrace things like the Ten Commandments, which are OT all the way. The OT is a prelude, it sets a backstory for the coming of Christ, but things depicted in it (like original sin) are essential to the message of Jesus; without the OT, the NT is baseless nonsense - well, more than it is already, anyways."	Well, I own a new testament (only the new) book myself. So I am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. What I am saying, and what Random Dude seem to not get, is that christianity is BASED on the new testament. We believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? A christian is a person who believes in Jesus - Jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. So that is why christianity is BASED (remember the word based) on the Gospels.	2
No, that's not my argument at all. My argument is this: You are criticizing the wrong religion. Judaism is the religion of the Old Testament, though I don't really expect you to get that through your thick skull.	christianity is different the old testament applies the old laws to follow where as christians follow the laws that jesus told us to preach this following message is for auntiechrist i am not a cult member i am a different denomination of christian that you have never heard of in your life.	2
Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.	Hey razza for i wanna say thanks for standing up for what u believe in, Most people want hard evidence that will prove Gods existence, when really we ourselves are evidence that God exists. Anyways i believe in change over time like how things are improved over time, like for say how cars have been improved to work on other things other than fuel. But i disagree with the whole monkey theory, God clearly said in the book of genesis that we were created in his image, We do not have a monkey god, its so sad to see how many people have fallen for this. God is God and he makes everything the way they are supposed to be. What good is faith with the presence of evidence, why do we rely on hard evidence, God says believe and you shall see my kingdom, of course people would come to jesus with evidence in their hands, but thats our main test here on earth, God is looking for those who will believe in him without seeing him, clinging to the promise of going to heaven one day and to conclude i just have to say that we are creation and nothing can change that.	2
"Well it sounds like a good idea for people of like mind to form associations and gather together for fellowship. However, according to the most prevalent (however illogical) interpretations of the words ""church"" and ""atheist"", forming an atheist church is a logical impossibility. Churches are by definition religious organizations and so atheists may congregate, but they cannot belong to a religious organization (a church) while maintaining their ""secular"" or ""not religious"" stance."

Also evolution is supposed to be banned from teaching in Texas and 10 other states by 2030 by their states constitution and replace it with the literal reading of the book of genesis do you support that?

Also evolution is supposed to be banned from teaching in Texas and 10 other states by 2030 by their states constitution and replace it with the literal reading of the book of genesis do you support that? I highly doubt it, and if so, then I lose hope in humanity.  Also by 2030 3/4 of Americans and 3/5 of Europeans will support evolution being banned what would you do when it happens? You have statistics to back that up? If that really is the case I'm going to have to cry over ignorance taking us over. If it turned out that evolution really started to become so unpopular that doesn't mean anything on whether or not it is valid. Truth isn't a democracy, truth will be whether we believe in the truth or not.	2
"You want to announce to the world that you have objectum sexuality and feel some deep personal commitment to an object, you go. If you want the rest of us to accord your relationship with that object the social or legal standing of a marriage, forget it. First off, a relationship with an object cannot fulfill the social functions of marriage. You cannot set joint goals with an object because an object has no goals. You cannot contribute mutually to building a life or future because an object has no volition. You cannot procreate because an object is not alive. You cannot care mutually for your community or extended family because not only does an object not have a family, but it just friggin' sits there. And while a person may draw a sense of emotional comfort from an object, you'd be hard pressed to argue that the object ""feels"" the same way (all theories of animism aside). It is provable, though, that the object does not ""respond"" to the person in any meaningful way. So a relationship with an object does not fulfill any of the social functions of a ""marriage."" Objects do not have the legal status of persons and it's just goofy to suggest that they should. Eija-Riitta Berliner-Mauer, who considers herself ""married"" to the Berlin Wall, describes tearing down the wall as an assault on her husband by a brutal mob. Obviously most of us do not think of tearing down a public object as an ""assault,"" because an object is not a person. Should she have had the right to insist that the wall not be torn down (and that Germany, incidentally, remain two separate nations) on the grounds that the wall is her ""husband"" and that trumps the fact that her ""husband"" is also an inanimate demarcation of an international boundary and is owned by someone else? I don't think you'll find many supporters for that position. Imagine what this might do to private property rights. Say, for example, that I ""marry"" your house. What rights over your property have I suddenly obtained by declaring myself married to it? If the answer is ""none"", and you can continue to exclude me from your property and modify your house or knock it down, or anything else you as a lawful owner of property might do, what does that do to my ""marriage""? If the answer is anything other than ""none"", what does that do to your property? Personally, I think that if you have objectum sexuality, you should consult a psychotherapist about whether or not you're having difficulty forming relationships with people. But if you want to go on being in love with an object, it's your life and that's fine too. Heck, if you want to hold a personal commitment ceremony with your coffee cup or the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Panama Canal or whatever, I say invite all your friends and have at. It's absurd to suggest that your relationship with the object be given any official status, though."	I think you're taking this a little too seriously ;) I wonder if I can marry my house in order to keep them from foreclosing on me. If they try to make me pay more money for it I'll say that they are enslaving my wife! ... treating her like chattel ;)	2
They hate you......alalalala im going to stop you right there its suits common lily get your head out of your ass	What???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????	2
"I had hoped you were making some kind of joke (there needs to be some kind of sarcasm/Irony emoticon you can put after text so people know what tone to read it in). I bring it up at every opportunity I see it because I think it is one of the largest problems we have on this site, and one of the key reasons why we have conflicts (or at least something that can exponentiate their severity). When we disagree with what someone says or believes, we like to then imagine that they have other flaws, and that everyone that shares these same beliefs also shares these flaws. In short we demonize groups, and when you demonize something, you become blinded and can justify terrible actions against it. Can you imagine trying to kill innocent people if you hadn't already prejudged them as guilty in some way just because of the belief system to which they subscribed, the political views they held or their country of origin? Of course you can't, and neither can any other sane human being. So too do generalizations make political discourse so frustratingly impossible. People demonize their opponents and therefore will be blinded to what their ""opponents"" are doing right, and will try to irrationally defend the actions of those who agree with them. Also, yes I think that free speech is being attacked by some Muslims, whereas Christians in the west haven't posed a serious threat to that particular pillar of our democracy."	"Remember that debate you started awhile back about generalizations? I did add another, more civil, argument - one which I'm sure you'd have approved of. Of course you can't, and neither can any other sane human being. I am, by your standards, sane? That's something I never expected. Also, yes I think that free speech is being attacked by some Muslims, whereas Christians in the west haven't posed a serious threat to that particular pillar of our democracy. Do you know what I like to do? To laugh at the Christians who give other Christians a bad name: Benny Hinn, van Impe, Robinson, etc. ""Anybody who believes in UFOs should be stoned to death. . ."""	2
I don't think it can be helped. This recent situation I tried to stop the feeling but to no avail I couldn't stop them. I think we must adjust to it.	If your talking about who I think your talking about I tried to intervene and got a bollicking, I couldn't give a toss about people arguing but making debates just to slag each other off is childish, maybe we need the internet version of the naughty step if you act like a child you get your account suspended for a day something like that	2
Uh, no offence doll but anyone with their head straight sees through stuff like that; girl wants to be something she isn't etc... heaps of people do it online, I have been part of many debating sites therefore seen it many many times... and you're just one of them!

If people are equally together, but separate in title, then the prejudice of people will remain and they will act when they see the title. 1. If someone has a problem with homosexuals having a civil union they will most likely have a problem with them being married.  2. A title is meaningless, its just words on paper. Regardless of the words on paper a marriage and civil union are the same thing. After the two were mixed (the schools) the prejudice remained for a time, but was slowly defeated. Yes, but acting like having different legal titles (that most sensible people don't care about anyway) is equivalent to segregation is outrageous. Gays go to the same schools, stores and transportation as straights, there is no law separating the two groups.  If gay people are equally married like straight people the prejudice when finding out they are gay, will remain but will hopefully also be defeated in time. You don't have to have the title of married for people to find out that you are gay. As I had stated earlier homosexuals are integrated into society and they are not separated from straights, the only difference is that from a legal stand point their legal unions have different names. You don't defeat prejudice by changing titles, you do it by integrating the actual people and as far as I can tell, gays and straights use the same services.	1. If someone has a problem with homosexuals having a civil union they will most likely have a problem with them being married. This is true, but they won't know if they are gay or straight when they read 'married' on their drivers license or whereever they had to put it. 2. A title is meaningless, its just words on paper. Regardless of the words on paper a marriage and civil union are the same thing. So why can't they have this useless title, if it's not harming anyone? there is no law separating the two groups. I can't really think of any other examples of being in a civil union being as discriminated against except for job opportunities.	2
Is that a cover up for saying you no longer keep in touch with anyone anymore, so it's easier to delete your account than deleting all your friends? Haha, kidding :) I've deactivated my facebook sometimes, but it's not because it is addictive that made me come back, but for one thing I am in school, and we have a group on facebook where we can for example if I don't know what homework I have tomorrow, then I can ask there. Also my colleagues have a facebook group as well, if I need someone to take a shift for me, I can post there and someone will reply. This is very practical :)	It's sad but it's kind of true. Once I graduated highschool, My friends and I parted ways. I remain in contact with only about three people from my highschool years. That's how life is.  Facebook seemed like a highschool thing to me. Hell, the only reason I made it in the first place was to get with a girl I went to school with!	2
Was that sarcasm?	"Well I couldn't click on the 'jump to debate'; button because I would get lost looking for your comment. But if this is about the "" i liked that last sentence"" then no it wasn't sarcasm. I thought it was quite humorous :)"	2
Maybe such cultural prerequisite still subliminally exist because they're true ;)	I'd like to build on that a bit with some vague specifics. Men have more testerone, which is a key factor in a lot of the work that they do. We all know that higher testerone levels lead to more aggression, which is great to take out on hard work, and increased muscle mass... which is again great to take out on hard work. Of course some women have higher than average testosterone levels too, making them more suitable for certain jobs that men are usually more qualified for. By nature, men tend to be better suited for the job. I'm going to give you an example... look at ants. You get a queen spawning more ants there while all these worker ants, well you guessed it, they do all the dirty work. I'm also going to add that woman can do the work too and in a world where top performance and efficiency in especially physical labor is what is sought out for by employers, men tend to dominate in this area due to the naturally male competitive nature.	2
I agree that the question is silly and no one really knows. (By the way, there are more civil ways of expressing your dissatisfaction with a question.) The thrust of the question is to start questioning why would social conservatives or values voters oppose an issue like universal health care and favor an issue like abortion.	Because Universal Health Care is specifically a theoretical approach to providing health care and has its main implications in economics. Abortion is specifically a theological issue and has its main implication is in metaphysics and the existence of the soul. Social Conservatism just doesn't really say anything on Universal Health Care and why should it? Now, I said that I believed Christian Marxist Socialism is a logical conclusion of a careful reading of the bible. The difference is that this is a much more contentious subject and Christian Socialism was never, on the whole, a doctrine adopted by the church nor one that is ever explicitly expressed in the canonical scripture.	2
Due to the first experiments, which were held with Dolly the Sheep, there was high tendency of embryo deaths. Only 1 attempt was successful out of over 270. Thus, it can be applied to humans. And if there will be question of selecting to perform cloning with the costs of human's life, it would be right to not clon one.	Well, your argument is based on ethical consideration, which is also important. Considering this side of the question, it is also unethical to clone people, because choosing the children's personality and making the identical and unique copy of a person can not be ethical.	2
"Certainly. Just as are conservatives. I agree with the intro to the website, claiming that both sides have hypocrites. Perhaps I should have posted on the negative as ""Liberals are hypocrites"" is a generalization, and we all know Terminator hates generalizations."	I don't hate generalizations. I just mention them so that I get the up-votes rather than AndSoccer16 - who really does hate generalizations.	2
"•Akulakhan(2302) Disputed 1 point Thats an impractical and irrelevant question: for there are no perfectly identical twins. And that's avoiding the problem; the problem still remains. You made an inherited claim that the genetic code from one individual isn't adequate to create another human, when the individual his/her/itself is the converse example, a contradiction. In fact, the reproduction of genetic code from a single code, is called cloning. And if there were, then it would still be irrelevant, for the sperm would be an extension of that person's, which ever twin it happened to be, self Which again changes nothing, because the clone is just as ""being"" as the original. 1) We have no absolute rights. So why would it matter if the fetus was some precious human with dignity and importance? 2) Nothing, except God, is sovereign Everything but God is sovereign. If no one talked about God, He'd be non-existent within one generation. 3) Sovereignty, in the sense of commanding one's life in the narrow sense of how we perceive, does not necessitate the affirmation of ""right,"" in the constitutional sense. 4) Ability to act does not necessitate the [being] of those same types of rights either. And again you are shooting yourself in the foot. So you are telling me you don't believe that a sovereign individual is necessarily entitled to rights? Then why not abort after birth? Physically healthy, maybe so. But physical goodness does not necessitate moral goodness. This is a separate debate I'd love to have later, would be too much fun. •lolzors93(1561) Disputed 1 point I'm not going to debate with you. You, unlike most people, have good points. I just am too lazy to actually debate them; and yes, I do disagree with them on logical grounds. The problem is that it reverts into too many sub-debates."	Is this meant for me? Are you saying you have won arguments? Can I ask lolzors93 and Akulakhan if they concur ;)	2

If you really want to debate this all you have to do is just actually do some research. There is no way that Bush could be held responsible for the crisis. It was a stream of events that lead up to it. For starters it was just as much governments fault as it was with the banks. The seed got planted way back in 1970 when they created Fannie and Freddie which the Government created.  The biggest kicker is Bill Clinton when he signed the Glass Stegall act which allowed banking and investment to operate under one company. Also the Community Reinvestment act which encouraged lending for affordable housing and helped poor people get financing. So it was really government intervention of the financing that got us into it. If you really want to blame someone Bill Clinton is the biggest reason for the meltdown. In 1999 the house tried to overturn this and Democrats turned the bill down and here we are today. Here is one link for you. If you really go out and look for the reason you will find it. <a href='http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html'>http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/                                       was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html 	Did you find it laughable that the Maestro himself, Greenspan, embraced the crazy notion that a self-regulating financial industry is sufficient regulation?  Ultimately though, self-regulation implies no regulation.	2

Do they have like any public groups or secret organizations? Also what is a neo-nazi? I have never heard of that before.	Public groups would be gangs, and general racists that flock to one another. A neo nazi is mostly a blanket term for people with a racist fear of people not of their race.	2

"I thought to myself ""Gee, I was a fucking idiot back then."" This happens to me A LOT. Though, I suppose, overall, it is a good sign, as it signifies your knowledge and intelligence has increased since that point."	ME TOO. I dont know, but when I look at my past debates compared to my debates now, I think, I have gotten a lot better. Back then, my debates were one sided and I dont usually see the points of other people. I also tend to misjudge that some people were taking it all personal on me, when it is really not what they do. I also enlarged my horizons when it comes to debating. I also learned a lot of things like being nice to other people no matter how rude they are to you and be straight with your answers.	2
Abraham said, after he was told to sacrifice his son, that he knew God would provide a sacrifice for him. He was told by God through some sort of means in actual language: God spoke directly to Abraham. The only thing we can take it on is faith that God is just and truthful, and was actually speaking to us, which is to say that we take it on faith that we are not insane. In practicality, I would probably go to a doctor and a pastor first, then, if the messages continued, in a very obvious and profound fashion, then I would.

Wait but grand master pope said so? .......... ......... ........?	yeah, lmao I guess the God who never changes changed his mind about atheists. :P what a conundrum.  Being – God has existed for eternity past and will exist for eternity future. He is without beginning and without end. (Ps 102:25-27; Mal 3:6)  Perfections – God is perfect and therefore can not change for the better and will not change for the worse. (Ps 102:27; Mal 3:6; Jas 1:17; Heb 13:8)  Purposes – God’s plans to bring something about or to do something will not and can not be changed. (Num 23:19; Isa 46:9-11; Jer 29:11; Eph 1:11; 3:9)  Promises – God’s promises to his creation will come to pass as they always have, without change. (Num 23:19; Isa 46:9-11)	2
Well, ask any Cuban person butchered by his men if he was a good guy... o wait, they were butchered... never mind. The guy was a violent, Marxist revolutionary who fucked over a shit load of people and helped put Castro (one of the worst leaders today) into power. I didn't see the movie, and I was interested, but then I heard that it was boring as fuck... and then later heard that it was played in the Carl Marx theater in Havana, Cuba. This meaning that the movie makes him look like a good guy (Castro would not allow a non-propaganda about Che to play in Cuba).	Amen brother. That man WAS evil. ..............................	2

"To be specific, Hitler stopped Hitler. Germany could have beaten Russia, however, Stalin began to give his generals power and allow them to fight the battles strategically. Hitler ignored most of his general's advice and made terrible decisions. And when Stalin ""stopped Hitler"" what did he do? Did he liberate the oppressed areas? Did he make their lives better? Nope, it was just like exchanging one dictator for another."	Well, I won't dis agree that Hitler stopped Hitler, but the wall of Katusha rockets put up by the Red Army had something to do with it. The Liberation of Europe by the USSR did make the lives of people in those areas marginally better, but after Stalin's death things really improved.	2

Cavemen didn't use that :)	"No of course not. Even if you dont use the products youll still gain muscle just at a slower rate. Your body will naturally rebuild muscle bigger after tearing as overcompensation but less quickly and not as big. The products and regimine help alot.

Did I really or are you just saying that? Has your mindset changed at all, as a result of my arguments? That's my goal. Since you assumed I was a conservative throughout a lot of this debate, I figured I'd share some info with you... I supported Obama back in 2008. However, I was younger and dumber back then. I have a better understanding of politics now. And I'll check out some of your debates.	You did partly change my mindset I mean I've always been opposed to what Obama had been doing with Syria but I had always viewed getting out of Iraq an accomplishment looking at it now after your argument it was completely insignificant. You also got me with the debt Obama raised it to a higher rate than Bush but you failed to acknowledge that the debt has been dropping since 2012, also I kind of got you on most of the Obamacare debate especially on saving money its not as bad as Republicans like Ted Cruise and Mitch McConnell make it. Also it kind of made sense to support Obama in 2008 I mean Bush was leaving office there was no better guy to vote for but him even the libertarians which I assume your political positions link up to the most had Bob Barr, nobody liked Barr so I don't really think you were fooled. Also quite clearly I don't think you are a Conservative but the way you debated seemed a little center right IMO!	2

Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	Amen. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. No one gets to the Father but by Him. Upvote.	2

Well, anyone can be open about their sexuality. I go to a very PC school (they freaked out over me bringing the American Flag to school, that's how PC it is) so extreme homosexuality is actually more acceptable than extreme heterosexuality. I am willing to accept that there may be schools that are unfair towards gay students when it comes to expressing themselves, but in other schools it's the other way around. Everyone should be open, free country.	"""I go to a very PC school (they freaked out over me bringing the American Flag to school, that's how PC it is)"" You gotta get out of there man."	2

The absence of the legal recognition of their parents' relationship will also impact these children. Children of same-sex couples are accorded a stigmatized status of being ""illegitimate"". To the extent that legal marriage fosters well-being in couples, it will enhance the well-being in their children who benefit most when their parents are financially secure, physically and psychologically healthy and not subjected to high levels of stress (Chan, et al, 1998; Patterson, 2001). Children of gay and lesbian couples are especially vulnerable if their parent's relationship dissolves (Amato, 2001).

I could have a bias for Minecraft, but that sounds awful. Are there any mods, or people making custom maps, or mini-games. Can you make a working virtual computation device in Roblox?  In Minecraft people create visual art, recreations of places real or imagined. Also people who make songs out of note blocks are amazing. I know I'm biased as all hell, and am too lazy to do research, because this debate is just asking what we play I don't have to prove anything. It's just my opinion. Is Roblox worth looking into?	It's pretty crappy, But there was one level I found to be extremely addicting and thanks to this debate I will go play it again.

I've already taken a geology course. Then why is it you don't know anything about geology? Why is everything you say completely inaccurate? Where is your supporting evidence?  Yet, in reality the earth isn't that old... but who's to know? People that know their geology. The earth is about 4.54 billion years old, as anyone that has taken intro to geology knows.  Have you heard of isostatic adjustment? Psalm 104:5-9 refers to it; this explains how pangaea could have happened. I have in fact. Isostatic adjustment is a glacier process. It does not cause continental rifting.  As a second note, there are many theories as to why continental drift happens: there is not just one. There is no debate about what causes continental drift. Zero controversy. (supporting evidence below) Every ocean has a mid-ocean ridge which is a rift that is still spreading and creating more seafloor all the time. This causes the continents to continue to move apart. Look at the diagram in the link so that you understand. Any person that knows even the basics of geology, knows all of these things. I simply do not believe your assertion that you have taken a geology course. If so, you must have failed it horribly, because you clearly have no knowledge of geology.

Today when I got home, I talked to my dad about his opinion on the matter. He is a native born Puerto Rican, and a U.S. citizen (of course) but he resides in the United States. He has served our country for almost 30 years, and has a lot of family still residing in Puerto Rico, so I think his point of view is valid. He told me that there are many factors that go into the whole debate. First of all, one of the main reasons they have rejected statehood is politics. Puerto Rico has a history of voting Democrat, so it all fluctuates. When there is a majority of Republicans in power, they want to hold it, and therefore would not like Puerto Rico to become a state. On the other hand, it would take a majority of Republican votes in Puerto Rico for statehood, so the only problem is that we have yet to reach that odd balance in power between the two governments and the two parties. Puerto Rico is also a major tourist attraction. It holds the only protected rainforest in American control; El Yunque. Also, they are major producers of important goods that we use: rice, coffee, sugar, and many others. They trade mainly with us anyways; why not just cut out the middle-man, so to speak? As for the language barrier, unless you've been there you may not know that almost all Puerto Ricans actually speak fluent English; they are taught it since the beginning of gradeschool. They even share the same currency as us. So that is the least of our issues in this debate. What we really need to focus on is whether they want to or not, and whether it is beneficial to us.	I have to agree with everything you say, the only reason staehood is voted down is because of politis and sometimes missinformation, also the referendums are tricky and they include options like statehood, independent, comonweath, none, ect.  I think that the referendums are a joke, I voted on one referendum in P.R and rerally I dont understand the way the referendums are done. Yo	2
Patriotism is one of the most retarded and childish ideas that still manages to permeate popular culture as a perceived virtue, even though it is a baseless and undeserved pride derived from the fallacy that being born within the same imaginary borders makes two people's individual achievements somehow shared, despite no mutual involvement from either party.	One of the most sensible statements I've read - a breath of fresh air. Up vote for you! = ) And on a more serious note as an extension to your argument: Patriotism is not only unfounded, it is also dangerous - a step on the path to nationalism but also a barrier to justice within the international community. I'll explain: A patriotic US citizen might feel that the withdrawl of US troops from Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq is an embarrassment. Similarly, a patriotic Brit might feel that the return of the Falklands to Argentina is a mistake. In both cases, patriotism is a barrier to justice - a very real barrier if patriotism runs rampant amongst the political elite.	2

No, the AK-47 is not the best firearm ever made. The only reason its used so much is because its cheap and easy to make, when soviet union collapsed these guns flooded the black market, they are unreliable and jam quite often. In call of duty its good, but in the real world, no.	Finally an argument that makes sense. AK variations are still used by Russia but they are better than the original like the AN94, AKS74u, AK103 bullpop.The Call of Duty producers are ignorant.	2

I mean I realize only the right is allowed to throw out insults with impunity, you are a sensitive bunch over there and cannot handle it so well, but this really wasn't that bad. Cheer up. You approach is better suited for the politicians that do have a say in, and power over, the rights of said people.

"Actually, if you recall correctly we entered the war after Japan attacked. We knew better then to get involved with a war that we didn't have anything to do with. Of course then there's the fact that Hitler was committing genocide, but at the time we didn't know the full extent of the atrocities he was committing. FDR was clever though. He was still helping the British without actually going to war, with the ""Lend-Lease"" policy. Iraq had an al-Qaeda base in their country before we attacked? This is news to me but I'll take your word for it. Was this the reason we were given for going to war? Was this why we bombed other areas? Is this why we're still there? Clearly the pretenses for sacrificing soldiers and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were not anything like what you are implying."	"The fact that we didn't get into WW II before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, has always rankled me as a German. The USA had enough information of what was happening there from those German-Jews and others who came here in the mid 1930's trying to escape Hitler's Germany before it became impossible to leave and his regime took off like a speeding bullet. We had everything to do with Germany's aggression toward the countries that surrounded them and the people who were not considered Aryan's...If 6,000,000 + people isn't enough to get involved with, I have to wonder what is! al-Quaeda had little if no presence in Iraq prior to our attack. The reason for war was WMD...the joke of ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" George W. Bush and his moronic advisor's led us to believe were true.

If you really want to debate this all you have to do is just actually do some research. There is no way that Bush could be held responsible for the crisis. It was a stream of events that lead up to it. For starters it was just as much governments fault as it was with the banks. The seed got planted way back in 1970 when they created Fannie and Freddie which the Government created.  The biggest kicker is Bill Clinton when he signed the Glass Stegall act which allowed banking and investment to operate under one company. Also the Community Reinvestment act which encouraged lending for affordable housing and helped poor people get financing. So it was really government intervention of the financing that got us into it. If you really want to blame someone Bill Clinton is the biggest reason for the meltdown. In 1999 the house tried to overturn this and Democrats turned the bill down and here we are today. Here is one link for you. If you really go out and look for the reason you will find it. <a href='http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html'>http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/09/                                       was_clinton_responsible_for_th.html 	"If you really want to debate this all you have to do is just actually do some research.

"True because when one person starts to follow that alone can be enough to convince others to follow. And also important because this could decide whether more will follow the initiator in the future or if no one follows him at all. Because what if the first follower is a known serial killer/murder/rapist or someone else the general public doesn't necessarily like ? Or if they wanted evil people and the first follower is like some ""do-gooder"" or something. The first follower is definitely important as the initiator. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz the video didn't load until after I finished this.

Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	I'd rather go to hell because hell seems to be populated with more good wise man than heaven.	2
Well, as long as the other person isn't over 18, it's legal in every state I believe. So I'm not sure what the problem is. There's nothing illegal about two people both under the age of consent having sex with eachother I dont' think. If they are over the age of consent, and you are under the age of consent, in your State, then you are probably making a mistake of one sort or another anyway. Unless you're a dude underage, then it's more like a score, but the other person could still be arrested. Unless you are both in High School, and one of you happens to be over 18 and you live in a State where age of consent is 18.  One of you could go to jail anyway and be labeled a sex offender for life, which is actually kind of retarded if you are both in High School.	I thought that it was like 2 or 3 years apart that the couple could be, even if one was above 18.	2
Sometimes debates are meant to be heated or have conflicts and there will always be someone who has conflicts with you even if your being peaceful with the person that dislikes you.

irst, the Hebrew word for “love” used here is not the typical word used for sexual activity. This word for “love” has clear political and diplomatic connotations (see 1 Samuel 16:21 and 1 Kings 5:1). Second, David’s comparison of his relationship with Jonathan with that of women is probably a reference to his experience with King Saul’s daughter. He was promised one of Saul’s daughters for killing Goliath. But Saul continued to add conditions upon this marriage with the underlying desire to have David killed in battle (1 Samuel 18:17, 25). The love David had received from Jonathan was greater than anything he could have received from Saul’s daughter. Third, the Bible clearly and consistently denounces homosexuality (Genesis 1:26-27; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:18-25). Extolling a homosexual love between David and Jonathan would be contradicting the prohibitions of it found throughout the Bible. The friendship between David and Jonathan was a covenantal relationship. In 1 Samuel 18:1-5, we read of David and Jonathan forming an agreement. In this agreement, Jonathan was to be second in command in David’s future reign, and David was to protect Jonathan’s family (1 Samuel 20:16-17, 42; 23:16-18). Obviously, these two men were also very good friends. In their relationship we can see at least three qualities of true friendship. First, they sacrificed for one another. In 1 Samuel 18:4, we read that Jonathan gave David his clothes and military garb. The significance of this gift was that Jonathan recognized that David would one day be king of Israel. Rather than being envious or jealous, Jonathan submitted to God’s will and sacrificed his own right to the throne. Second, in 1 Samuel 19:1-3, we read of Jonathan’s loyalty toward and defense of David. King Saul told his followers to kill David. Jonathan rebuked his father and recalled David’s faithfulness to him in killing Goliath. Finally, Jonathan and David were also free to express their emotions with one another. In 1 Samuel 20, we read of a plan concocted by Jonathan to reveal his father’s plans toward David. Jonathan was going to practice his archery. If he told his servant that the arrows he shot were to the side of the target, David was safe. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were beyond the target, David was to leave and not return. Jonathan told the servant that the arrows were beyond the target, meaning that David should flee. After releasing his servant, Jonathan found David and the two men cried together. Rather than being evidence for a homosexual relationship in the Bible, the account of David and Jonathan is an example of true biblical friendship. True friendship, according to the Bible, involves loyalty, sacrifice, compromise, and yes, emotional attachment. That is what we should learn from David and Jonathan. The idea that the only person in the Bible described as “a man after God’s own heart” (Acts 13:22), was a practicing homosexual (or bisexual) is ridiculous and has no true biblical basis.

The Hebrew word used in both cases is ahab or ahabah.	2
"""It will be several decades before we could work ourselves into a position diplomatically that would allow us to remove troops and support from around the world."" I don't think I follow you. Will our allies be angry with us for removing bases from their lands?  I don't think so. They might even be glad that we can begin to lower our deficit by not pouring so much money into military spending. I think our allies would prefer the US have a strong economy than a strong military presence in their country... In addition, it would improve diplomacy with countries that don't like us so much - like Palestine, Iran..."	Most of the bases on foreign soil are there with the explicit permission of foreign governments and they wouldn't be there if said government didn't want them there. In some instances it's a security measure. More often though, there are economic and political considerations. A US military base is almost an assured economic boon to the area where it's stationed. People may hate the U.S. but they have no problem taking money from U.S. soldiers stationed overseas. Also the U.S. allows allies to use our military installations. It's a tit-for-tat agreement whereby the U.S. is allowed a military presence within an allied nation under the assumption that that allied nation receives U.S. military support and that the U.S. will use it's logistics command to support allied operations. They want us there, probably even more than we want to be there.	2
It is always great to have both, but it usually doesn't work that way. Brains gets you much further in life than beauty does. Beauty can help you with some things like getting out of a speeding ticket or getting a discount on something you really want, but when it comes down to it you can't get ahead in life without brains. You need brains to pass test to get through elementary school, to get through middle school, to get through high school, to get through college, and to get a good job. I mean really your college professor is not gonna put a perfect score on your final exam just because you flirted with him/her they have hundreds of other students to think about ones that actually have brains.	yes both are work.. it depend. the brain work always but not beauty.	2

since you are a black dude I have to let you know that black people were the first humans to evolve from apes according to the leading theory of evolution.

If you have the ability to save the five teens and you do not, then you've indirectly were the cause of their death.	Ah, but this is where the morality comes into play. If you don't act, then yes, you indirectly killed 5 people. But, by acting, you directly kill one person. Very interesting.	2

I was kidding, originally, but now I'm genuinely confused. Based on the description in Chuck's debate (tracks, the speed of the trolley, etc,) I had assumed by trolley he meant trolley car, or trolley bus. The kind of electric tram thing, a cable car, or mini-train kind of deal that moves throughout a city. We have those in SF.  What you just described is a shopping cart. What we call a shopping cart, anyways.  I was kind of wondering how a fat man, regardless of how large he is, could stop a speeding cable car if you pushed him in front of it. But similarly I don't see how a shopping cart, even if it was filled with lead and bricks, could kill five people at once, and I don't see how the kids playing on tracks has any relevance to a shopping cart, though it would to a cable car.	I just got the word trolley from Wikipedia actually. Let's not try and pick holes in the hypothetical, just assume that it is a cable car, that could be stopped by a very fat man. Let's say the fat man has, I dunno, sodden clothes or something. Maybe he's a jedi, but this is more about morality than practicality.	2
No way in hell was Hitler a socialist. Socialism: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. Hitler nationalized most of the German economy, that fits the bill. Socialism was everything he stood against Then why was he the leader of the national socialist party? Why did he implement socialist policies? You are a total idiot. Aww the little boy with the single digit IQ score has to resort to name calling.	I am not a little boy and I personally advocate abolishing IQ tests altogether because I believe that speed of learning and memorizing isn't anything to do with intelligence, it is instead one of almost infinite aspects comprising it (but IQ seems to assume that this to be the only factor in determining intelligence). Hitler was neither left-wing nor right-wing. He was an economic centrist who leaned to right-wing philosophy a lot of the time (hence he had a heavy war on communist Russia as a huge advocate of capitalism).	2
I guess the reason for this is that if the guy takes his clothes off first, and the woman changes her mind after seeing his package, she can run away (cause she's still dressed) and he can't follow because he's butt naked. But if the woman takes her clothes off first, then she can't run away. Her only option is to grin, bear it, fake an orgasm and try to get away as soon as he falls asleep (which is usually a few minutes after his orgasm). Anyway, I learned my lesson the hard way but I never made that mistake a second time ;)	You paint such a romantic picture of sex Joe. .	2

I know that love goes both ways between man and dog, for all I know the dog could be just as into the sex with his owner, as the owner is. But just because the dog goes up and licks your face, that isn't necessarily a sign that he wants to have sex with you. A lick in the face, is like a hug - not a kiss or a sexual invitation. If someone could prove in some weird way that their dog truly WANTS to be married and have a sexual relationship with them, then I don't see why they shouldn't. But as for now we have not developed any technology that allows us to communicate with a dog. We have the training stuff, where we tell a dog to lie down, then he lies down. But we have not any equipment to ask a dog a question, where that answer is based on the Dog's own opinions and feelings.	You agree that love can go both ways between man and dog, and that the dog might be into a sexual relationship.  So, I refer you to my point about the empirical experiment.   Attempt to have sex with the unrestrained dog; if the dog doesn't run off or show signed of distress, I would say that proves that the dog is into it. Does it not?	2
I see what you mean. I know first hand how irrational she can be.	I thought we were cool. I am not perfect, but damn. I am only irrational when people judge me or piss me off.

"I thought to myself ""Gee, I was a fucking idiot back then."" This happens to me A LOT.

No, which is why I try not to stress myself out. I used to watch Cable News all the time (MSNBC, Fox, CNN, etc.) and I would just be pissed off all the time about shit that was happening and idiots that debated with semi-idiots. I'll admit, being pissed was fun, but it was also stressful. I've decided to get out of politics and focus on philosophy (political, Universal, etc.). The only problem is I'm surrounded by it. Hell, I come here and I read Time Magazine. I do it to get educated, but always the politics comes back. Obama does something stupid and I've got something else to be pissed about.  But still, the only TV I watch is comedy and the occasional drama (Breaking Bad, fuckin' awesome). And, I'm playing a shit load more video games (just like the good ol' days of teenage bullshit). I read like always, but I read just a little bit more. Thanks to cutting out politics from my TV, I've been able to have more time doing stupid, but awesome shit.	Yeah, I also try to watch a lot of comedy but there's hardly anything that's worth the time. I've tried the new Jeff Dunham show and it's marginal. So what are you playing now? I'm playing Dragon Age origins.	2

Yes, it is true that its unlikely limmiting would do much now(it might have small changes), however restaraunts were one of the causes of high levels of obesity.	I beg to differ, soda and candy are much more unhealthy (drinking soda on a regular basis is equivalent to smoking cigarettes) and fast food was never intended to be something you eat every day. They were supposed to serve quick food for people on the road who didn't want to sit down and spend $10 per person on a meal. It was the choice of some people to eat their food everyday. I mean, the limit would have no effect on me since I don't drink soda or eat fast food, but still, I doubt it would do anything for most people either.	2
That's what all the virgins say.	Ain't that the truth?..uh..I mean sex! I have alot of that with women! Heh...	2
"""Well, if one is under the impression they can jump out of a plane without a parachute"" In 1942 a Soviet pilot named I. M. Chisov plunged 22,000 feet without a parachute after bailing out of his Ilyushin 4 bomber. German pilots had attacked Chisov’s plane, and he didn’t open his chute because he was afraid it would allow his attackers to find him. He landed on a snow-covered slope and rolled downhill, badly hurt and unconscious—but alive. (how-to-fall-out-of-a-plane-and-live) The secret is too land on snow :)"	That's some 007 shit.

Why I think it wouldn't. 1. Rigor mortis. If they were reanimated they would either not be able to move or the animation would make their bones snap everywhere from trying to move. 2. Their eyes would decay quick, causing them to not see. 3. The only thing a virus would re-animate would be their brains and if that's the case then they wouldn't be so dumb like in the movies, comics, and books. 4. There's no proof that if one person were to come back to life that they could infect others in anyway or have a hunger for brains. Thus not even being close to being an apocalypse.

However, if Obama is disliked at the moment a successful war could seriously boost his popularity and even leave him with a good legacy. I have a feeling that is all he needs to care about at the moment, since he cannot get re-elected he just wants to make sure he's remembered in a good light.	It worked for Thatcher but at that point Britain weren't pissed off with her for sending troops out to fight wars we felt we shouldn't be involved in, I can see this doing the opposite for Obama.	2

Actually, the question is not stupid in that a woman actually faked breast cancer in order to get implants. <a href='http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33907426/ns/today-today_people/'>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33907426/ns/                                       today-today_people/  But I can see why you would think that it was a stupid question so I'll up vote you in the hopes that you get at least one reward point ;)	"First off, I could care less how many ""reward points "" I have. Secondly, I read the original article before, and I still think that the original OP is a silly question."	2
I like that song now it will be stuck in my head for awhile.	Me too... and for some reason it always reminds me of this other 80's song:	2
Actually they relinquished they'r British citizenship once it became clear the war was about independence from Britten. Just saying. I do agree this could work if the child was just born some where els but raised here because that would be virtually no different than being a natural citizen. but any farther than that it's just to risky.	"What's interesting though is that the British Crown still considered them British citizens. Thats why they viewed conscription of American sailors during the Napoleonic wars as legal. They didn't view us as ""Americans"" until we kicked their ass in the War of 1812, which many consider still a part of the war for independence."	2
He doesn't know what he is talking about, he has obviously taken in too much Coke LOL	Haha! I should have known... you're a Pepsi person !	2
I am pro abortion, we need as many abortions as possible. The last thing we need is more fucking babies.	Babies do not fuck. Your logic is suspect ;)	2
<a href='http://www.toyotaownersclub.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19377'>http://www.toyotaownersclub.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19377  That's how you turn off the airbags on toyota. anyway who said those people are stupid? Maybe they have a lack of knowledge. Its their own opinion If they're opinion is, that children are safer in the back despite what tests and facts sais and traffic experts say, then I would allow myself to call them stupid. BUT, you I wouldn't call a person who says that children should be allowed to sit in front, stupid. If he thinks the child is safer there, then he is stupid. If he just thinks it should be allowed for them to sit there, then he is not stupid (maybe he is, but not in that area .. if you understand ? ) I don't understand the first line you wrote, sorry.	The first line means that you were the one who said that you cannot avoid talking about that. And this for the website	2
The fact that you know all this makes you gay .	Takes one to know one	2
No but debates will keep being posted about in until the 22nd. 	See, we all are alive. And we are the DOOMSDAY survivors.	2
You should be aware that even in your attempts to faithfully adhere to your favorite dictionary definitions, the interpretive task is still up to you. If you don't see any value in discussing word meanings and definitions and whether they are logically tenable fine. How about this... I'd like to get your opinion on whether or not I should be classified as atheist (according to the interpretation YOU favor of what it means to be atheist) We shouldn't need to have a long drawn out debate about that, as it should be easy to establish with a short Q and A session. You ask the questions, I answer them, and from my responses you should be able to quickly and definitively explain why I do or do not fit the atheist label. Are you game?	No offence (and I actually mean it this time) but I'd rather not.	2
First of all I want to tell you that I get what you are saying. I truly do but it seems to me like what you are dong is trying to make freedom of religion and freedom from religion be the same thing and to me at least they seem to be entirely different things. To go back to your soda analogy freedom of soda would be like having a refrigerator filled with every kind of soda and you could pick any one you want. Whereas freedom from soda would mean you could chose to have some beverage other than soda. See how the two are different?	"""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" can be interpreted as being both the freedom of and freedom from religion"	2
I trust that he will be outta office Jan 2017 :D	Why is it 2017? Isnt it 2016? Or is that his leaving time?	2
I see. I woud assume that we have two separate viewpoints on this debate.	Oh definitely! Lol.	2
God, no. Don't you think religion has caused enough damage? Expanding it means more people, which means more corruption. As is, there's too much. You want to be Christian, then be Christian, but don't keep trying to convince others to believe it.	amen to that bother. LOL LOL I am dying LOL that was a good message LOL	2
Oh man, I have no idea. I know that Feinstein or Boxer got one of those big government construction contracts assigned to her husbands company.	As far as using political power to pander favors, I don't think one is better than the other.	2
lack of religion .	"No it isn't. Lack of religion is not addressed. Here is the amendment as it is written ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right or the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" I too learned in school that the firs part read ""congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free practice thereof or lack thereof"" in fact if I wrote the first amendment down on a test and didn't add the ""lack thereof"" part it was counted wrong but when I looked it up I learned lack of religion isn't even addressed my civics teacher even admitted that."	2
Yeah they know just how to hurt you the most .	They know where all the buttons are hidden .	2
Why do you think we even need a separation of church and state?	Its needed because if we let it slide the religious will try to smear there filth into our laws, we have to stop them in there tracks before it gets out of hand.	2

Maybe he's downvote..., creating more drama about himself ;)	It could be. Let's blow this popstand. ;)	2
Can I ask what you think will happen to non believers after they die?	My honest opinion is that when non-believers who don't believe in Jesus Christ and they die they will go to hell because they choose not to believe in Christ but if they repent and turn from their sins and believe in Jesus Christ then they can go to heaven.	2
I'm a fan of Chinese food, so I'll go with Cats:) p.s. It says I need to add more characters to get to 50, so I'll add that Chinese food really woks my world, LOL	WTH? Bwhahaha! Now that's some good wok 'n' roll! There's a hairball on my fork hehe	2
That's what's called cynicism, and I am not fan of it. There are such things as selfless acts...not everyone has an ulterior motive.	I don't. I try to make everyone around me feel comfortable, and many would call me a pushover sometimes, but that's only because I don't want to be seen as a jackass. My ulterior motive is pride.	2
Since when have any of your post been G ?	"I think this one is G. You look at it and you go, ""Geeee"" ;)"	2
I thought the debate was on captain planet being the greatest superhero not what superheros could woop captain planets ass :L He may lose in a fight, but he will always win when it comes to sustaining the environment.	In all fairness, I wasn't the person who brought up who could whoop ass. He is the greatest because he destroys polluters.	2
Let’s take a look on our environment, it is hard to admit, but the flora and fauna of the earth dies, and practically we can’t do anything significant in order to save extinction species. Cloning will help to restore balance between humanity and nature. And again example with cloned sheep Dolly, it is really useful discovery, because now we slightly know how to clone animal. And with this knowledge we have to move on, and learn how to revive them. Revive what we have destroyed, correct our mistakes, safe our planet.	Well, I'm not sure, how can be balance between humanity and nature can be restored?	2
Well I mainly feel enraged at these fucking assholes I don't feel that they deserve sympathy what so ever lol I really do like watching shit like this because the more I do the more loathe these bastards and I love it!	O for sure they piss me off too, but it's not all Republicans and even Christians it's the fundamentalist ones, but I feel ya for sure, I would love to punch one in the mouth !	2
logicsoup could you give me more informaition or a page about this because I have a debate on monday please	Here's an excellent page to start your research. <a href='http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=civil+war'>Civil War Page	2
Those whom commit/will commit suicide, no longer had/have the desire to live. Why is suicide then described as the most courageous act possible? People hesitate before committing suicide.  I didn't say that people can't have contradicting desires. They do, people long for non-existence all the time. For people who commit suicide, this desire for non-attachment is stronger than their desire to live. But even if this other desire is stronger, there's still a desire to live. Do you honestly think people who commit suicide are happy? If they had no desire to live, they would be happy to kill themselves. Yet they are always unhappy. The only exception to this rule is probably those deep down in the depths of psychosis, but I don't think these cases are relevant. So no, the fact that people commit suicide does not contradict this generalization.	The only exception to this rule is probably those deep down in the depths of psychosis, but I don't think these cases are relevant. Why not? Because it's a tiny bit of information it's irrelevant?  Whatever. My only point was that it wasn't a fact....since you've admitted that it's just a generalization. Then we are done.	2
Well it is OK there is nothing immoral about it. I find it quite Ironic how you had a go at me for judging people who do drugs but now you're judging people for doing the innocuous thing of having sex before marriage, most people do it.	I find it quite Ironic how you had a go at me for judging people who do drugs but now you're judging people for doing the innocuous thing of having sex before marriage, most people do it. I find it quite idiotic of how you assume that asking a question is judging, but you changed your flawed reasoning on the subject to something reasonable and that is all that matters.	2
It was theirs in the first place. They were deprived of what was rightfully owned them. They should most defiantly get it back.	What about the animals that owned it before them? What about the animals that owned it before those animals? You see how this logic is flawed? When we have needs we take, carnivores need to eat so they take the meat of animals. Herbivores need to eat so they take the life of plants. Humans need to thrive in civilizations so they take the lands of creatures that exist there. It's survival of the fittest when it comes down to basic animal nature and if we are not the fittest we lose, or if they aren't they lose.	2
Thats what's interesting, why should you care if an animal is taped or not being killed?  Do you feel a particular connection to the horse in this video? Do you know the horse? Would you feel more or less the same had it been a person, a human whom you did not know?  I would imagine humans would feel more prone to be upset if another human gets blasted in the head than a horse.  Why does filming make it more or less humane?  Humane is a very interesting topic in how it pertains to how humans view the world, and are protective, of the world around them.	No I didn't know that horse but that doesn't mean I should not feel sympathy for him. I don't know Jamie Bolger but I still feel great sympathy for him and his family. What I find worse about this is that if this was a human the world would probably go crazy about it and say how sick this person was but because its a horse no one really cares and I feel that animals also deserve the care that a human would.  I find the taping disrespectful I would hate for my death to be taped and put on YouTube for some snide point to prove.	2
Have scientists fully proven he doesnt exist by 100%? Also this debate was for the religious.	Oh my apologies, I shall leave...	2
Neo Nazis and Skinheads. The gangs (usually in prison) that are comprised of white, similar looking people, all covered in tattoos, all bald. That's what I mean, I don't think a political organization of them could still exist, what with most governments trying to propose world peace.	Do they have like any public groups or secret organizations? Also what is a neo-nazi? I have never heard of that before.	2
Your daughter will want to be raped at clubs if you go out and do it regularly! =o	What ?	2
Okay you win LOL! check out some of my debates BTW. comment filler	Did I really or are you just saying that? Has your mindset changed at all, as a result of my arguments? That's my goal. Since you assumed I was a conservative throughout a lot of this debate, I figured I'd share some info with you... I supported Obama back in 2008. However, I was younger and dumber back then. I have a better understanding of politics now. And I'll check out some of your debates.	2
I have never made a debate stating my departure just one saying that I would not be posting until the trolling was resolved because every argument I made was getting spammed and mass-down voted.	Not like you were <a href='http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/throwing-a-fit.gif'>throwing your toys out of the pram or anything.	2
Reality is purely conceptual and the word conceptual is purely conceptual so we might as well just say this about everything then and in the end realise the definition of 'yes' and 'no' is purely conceptual and this side is conceptually capable of being the right side.	Reality is purely conceptual and the word conceptual is purely conceptual so we might as well just say this about everything then and in the end realise the definition of 'yes' and 'no' is purely conceptual and this side is conceptually capable of being the right side. That right there is a snapshot of everything that goes on in atypican's brain.	2
Individual biases should not affect a properly structured group of individuals. Obviously if there is no structure and the decisions are purely relied on a democratic-voting-like system then biases will dominate the decision making process however this is irrelevant for a structured mass as their ability to provide diverse and unique arguments assist the logical process more effectively than a single individual's wisdom which once again falls to pray of bias.	"wrong.... check the structure... council-mayor senate-president board of directors- CEO member of a group-leader see! although it is acknowledged that a group can ""help"" in the outlining the path for the right decision, it would still boil down to an individual to litigate, moderate and ultimately decide based on the consensus. a leader will always have the power to escalate or veto an idea simply because he was given authority to preside- proving that an individual is still the end-point of producing good decisions."	2
so you're saying he DOES play favorites but only because he has too.	I am not saying that God plays favourites. I am saying that whatever bad happens, the devil is keeping things in balance and whatever good happens, god is keeping things in balance. No good can happen without some bad. I say it again, life cannot be all rainbows and sunshine.	2
Yea that divine right was all well and good, until believers of other religion comes along, then you have people fighting against one another while any outsider can look for the weak spots and attack. Or in the case of America and Britain could end up leaving. I'd weigh the power of these two all powerful governments by the victories of modern day. Monarchies have the British. Dictatorships have North Koreans. North Korea never had any major parts defect. Britain did.	King Louis XIV of France didn't have this problem. He reign for a long time because the base religion was wide spread. So other religions wouldn't matter. Also absolute monarchs were quite well of and didn't have many problems. As for North Korea.....they keep starting some. I do see a point in your post though.	2
Depends on the type of vampire if it was vampires from twilight ya it would be a problem because people would die laughing after seeing them sparkle in the sun.	Twilight vampires are not vampires. I do not know what the fuck they are, but they are not vampires.	2
Part of the reason is because girls generally have shorter legs than guys, so we have to walk faster to keep up. Usually.	And also because guys have longer arms so they can drag themselves along by their knuckles? ;)	2
Of course, of course. I know I don't have a master mind. I would like to have one tho.	"Cool! And ""tho"" is spelled ""though"" English sucks balls.............."	2
Was there a master race? We are all practically the same with traits specified to out environment so that's false. Was he German? He was in fact Austrian. I think he was not only wrong in his pursuits he was wrong in his reasoning.	Well, he was a born in Austria and had Austrian citizenship, but when he became Chancellor of the Third Empire he got German citizenship.	2
Yeah okay. I just know that I do not support bestiality, because I don't see how a dog could sign a contract, where he'd agree to stay with his owner for better or for worse. Also, when you are allowed to marry, you are also allowed to divorce. How should a dog ask for a divorce? I mean come on.. there is no direct communication.	"The dog could, ""file for divorce"" by running away. Many would say physical communication is much more direct than verbal communication.  When you are in a close loving relationship with someone, is it not often true that you can sense something is wrong before they tell you in words?"	2
We have two parts, at least, to our being: the body and soul.	We have a great number of parts. But ignoring obvious logical contradictions, If we were created in the image of the trinity, why doesn't each individual consist of three distinct/identical persons?	2
There are thousands of accounts - if not millions - detailing things from aliens to pyrokinesis.	Of course there are. Serveral are unfounded, however. Reguardless, all it takes is one indisputable account. Which there are several. I have my doubts, as any, but I also have my experiences, which prevent me from wholly denying the paranormal.	2
Okay listen, from now on I will not abuse the down voting option. I am going to tone the down voting way down. Not completely, but I will no longer abuse it.  I would like to publicly apologize for my actions. I messed up, and I am sorry.	Apology accepted Jake. Just try not to let your temper get in the way of well thought out voting. And look at the up votes you just got for being honest about it. Well done bro!	2
No because he has been caught in many scandles. Even things people wouldn't be too mad about he kept secret. The IRS picked on people he didn't like and he knew about it! I don't trust him!	I wonder who he's pointing at? Didn't his mother teach him it isn't nice to point?	2
I can not speak for God, you are correct, it will be hes decision and his alone but I would not want to be in the shoes of the Nazis.	I wouldn't either. I've enough cousins who died in the war under Hitler - one was even SS.	2
Do they do the dirty sanchez? ;)	I don't know what that is. It sounds gross though. LOLZ. ;)	2
Gross.... Yeah, not worth it! Vote for president Jacob and I will bribe Andy to let you get away with all sorts of trolling! A president we all can trust.	Okay dude, I'll vote for you but Andy pretty much lets me get away with trolling anyway.	2
I've been reading Playboy since I was 12. Which is probably why my eye sight is going bad. I remember something about going blind..... hmmmm ...... that reminds me, I need to renew my subscription ;)	Playboy is some good stuff eh? I'm not even talking about the pictures either. They got all kinds of interesting stuff, from cars, to Jokes, to celebrities, all the way back to short stories. Pretty good stories too :)	2
I wouldn't have agreed with this until I watched the video. It's quite shocking to see the positive effects the drug could have on people's lives. Of course the negative effects are still there, but a compromise in the law allowing controlled use in extreme situations could be a really good thing.	"i agree, but if you open a box of paracetamol, or prescribed drugs the doctors gives you, the amount of ""side affects"" that are involved with what you are taking are terrible. some can cause ulcers, vomiting internal bleeding, yet these drugs are legal. There is SCIENTIFIC PROOF that the pure form MDMA helps the problems above. why are we not funding this!"	2
Ew. .	it happens is all i'm saying just dont have sex right after eating a giant burrito	2
Next thing you know the government is going to tax the air I breathe ;)	you are so right in what you said, its a dam shame the government dont tax their staff alot more, make them sweat abit more.	2
I didn't watch the video, so if that is important then sorry lol. But anyways... What do you think a world without money would be like?	in a nutshell true freedom. Freedom to unlock everyones full potential and excel us all, I and many of us feel that the monetary system is outdated and is no longer needed, yes we needed it to get to this point but it spiraled out of control and it's a major problem and will eventually kill us all if we don't change our social structure.	2
Ismalia, it seems as though you thoroughly enjoy flaunting your ideals and characteristics to prove.....what?	I flaunt nothing. I merely stand up for what I believe in. All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men (and women) to do nothing. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Those who stand for nothing will fall for anything. I sir, am not content to sit on my ass and watch things happen. I am going to take action, and make a difference in this world if it is the last damned thing that I do. I hope that is okay with Your Highness. Besides, I was making a point that not all Christians are bastards, and that it is wrong to stereotype. Excuse the Hell (pun intended) out of me for giving a damn (pun intended).	2
I have to go to a lot of sketchy places for work. I try to work a little faster when I'm at those places.	The sketchiest place I've ever been was Alexandria, Egypt. We were in a taxi on the way back to the cruise ship and I thought for sure the taxi driver was going to murder us. I will never go back to Egypt as long as I live.	2
Does it matter that the CD community establish that NewLee is a coward or not? The clear answer is no.	I concur it doesnt really matter per se, but where I'm from we call out bullies	2
This cartoon is misleading. Yes, the two terms are separate, but they are actually equal. The only difference between a traditional marriage and a civil union is the name, there is no actual difference outside of the title. This isn't like it was in the 1950's when white kids went to nice, clean schools with good teachers and all the black kids went to dirty, rundown schools with bad teachers.	The separation of the two, made one worse for wear, and one better by comparison. The reason the schools for black people were not as good as the schools for white people was because of prejudice. People didn't like blacks so they treated them and their property as still unequal. If people are equally together, but separate in title, then the prejudice of people will remain and they will act when they see the title. After the two were mixed (the schools) the prejudice remained for a time, but was slowly defeated. If gay people are equally married like straight people the prejudice when finding out they are gay, will remain but will hopefully also be defeated in time.	2
I can agree that it is geographically real, just not the fact that all the incidences of death are linked to the triangle itself as the Bermuda Triangle is only unique of its compass difference of the northern direction. Otherwise, I agree on its geographical output.	"LOL Yea me neither. I was just kind of being oblivious so that the debate creator would clear up his meanings a bit more.  This happens often, a statement thats really vague that could have a huge range of answers. like the commonly posted ""Do guns kill"" or ""Are guns bad"""	2
In other words I am not specifically antisemitic, just anti religion. Give me any religion and I will argue to my fullest extend against it. The other debate was on Israel. Being anti-Israel is not antisemitic.  And someone tell GuitarGuy that I was wrong, it's not only when people insult me I get offended, it's when people label me too :P	I bet you'd shove a Jew into an oven if you thought you wouldn't get caught. ;)	2
..................................Hellno                                         i thank you i am not GD i an somebody you know.	The subspense of not knowing is killing me.  Who are you Mic3?	2
LOL, right, that whole other side must have never done BMXing.	I have tried doing tricks on a bike. I indeed learned that speed is only necessary when you want to ride with no hands for a period of time but I have gone sort of slow and maintained balance without using my hands. A wheelie does not always require speed. However on a sports bike I think keeping your bike in balance is necessary if someone wants to do random tricks like standing on their bike or sitting backwards or laying down on their bike.	2
The harm transgenesis CAN do outweighs the good it could POTENTIALLY do. When a transgenic organism is created, it has been altered on the fundamental level. When the basic genetic make-up of an organism is altered, scientists have no way of controlling or preventing maladaptive genes from developing. Harmful mutations can occur regardless of the scientists' efforts to help the organism. It can also change what genes remain dormant or active in the organism, creating a phenotype that the organism did not previously have. Tampering with the organism's DNA through transgenesis has not been proven to consistently help organisms, but always puts the organism in danger of harmful mutations or genetic changes.	This can create new species but also completely wipe out old species ruining the food chain and messing up everything.	2
"Well I couldn't click on the 'jump to debate'; button because I would get lost looking for your comment. But if this is about the "" i liked that last sentence"" then no it wasn't sarcasm.

"I woke up. I had coffee , a smoke , a coffee. (aka breakky) Scrunched ;) , not folded! Showered. Job searched. Went to visit nieghbour. Had coffee , had smoke , came home.

Had coffee , had smoke , had coffee. Spoke to other nieghbour about the same topics as the day before , as the month before , as the year before. (had two smokes and a coffee in the process) Gave cash to nieghbour to get me two cans of ""mother"" while they were at shop. Waited for return. Had coffee , had smoke , another smoke. Got ""mother"" .  Came here to check CD. Drinking can of ""mother"" Typing this.... .....going for smoke. EDIT; Been , done that ."	I woke up. Thank God for that! She's alive! I had coffee , a smoke , a coffee. (aka breakky) Were you awake before your coffee? Scrunched ;) , not folded! Who in their right mind would fold it - where is the fun in that? Had coffee , had smoke , came home. Can't live without that fifteenth cup of coffee in the morning, now can we? Spoke to other nieghbour about the same topics as the day before , as the month before , as the year before. (had two smokes and a coffee in the process) Oh! What repetition! What stability!	2
Mic is still here just in the form of another account. 	mic is prodigee, right?	2
Oh, you're just teasing me now ; ) Next thing you'll be telling me is that you're a red head and you have a twin sister who likes to join in on the fun and you two share everything. Who put you up to this? Cartman? Wait.... I didn't tell him that fantasy.... ;)	God, I wish I was a red head! I've always been jealous of them and they are hot. And I am actually a twin but sadly my twin is a he. And the idea of doing anything with him disgusts me.  Lol, I'd never lie to you.	2
Not much... been pretty slow... When's your B-day? We'll have to throw ya a big CD Birthday bash! ;)	Blah on it being slow here. You and I need to shake things up ;D It's Tuesday, but he's doing something for me Saturday. I'm probably doing nothing on the actual day XD So we should totally have a bash to cheer me up Lol	2
Please elaborate. Describe a hypothetical situation.	"The old "" would you steal to feed your family"" queston. From the perspective of the thief, he sees himself as justified. From the perspective of the baker, he see the thief as hurting his own ability to feed his family."	2
Maybe I should rephrase the title.... When I say God I don't want you to think of the Christian God, I'm going to change it to creator... Because that's more broad... Wait.	"Hmm... Well, I haven't really studied any other religious documents, so I don't know if they refer to their god/s as a specfic gender (except the Greek and Roman gods, but most accept the fact that they don't exist), so I'll stick with ""God has no gender."" :p"	2
Please share some of your genius with me then. I'm dying to hear how this can work.	Imagine a species is divided, for whatever reason. Perhaps a flash flood has changed the flow of a river, perhaps a drought has caused the species to range further for water and divide themselves, perhaps a food shortage has done the same. Perhaps there is a combination of multiple reasons that cause a species to divide into two separate populations that are physically removed from one another. They are still the same species. One group of the species is living under very similar conditions to the original biome; the other group is under somewhat different conditions. The former group is already fairly well adapted to the biome, but the latter group struggles to survive. The latter group is shaped by stronger (relative to the species capabilities) and more importantly different selective pressures. Now, give it time. As the different conditions favor different traits, the two populations begin to diverge. Given enough time, the group under different conditions will eventually change to the point where they are no longer genetically compatible with the original group. Now, we have two different species- one evolved from the other, while the ancestor lives on.	2
It's real, and it does make you feel better... but, it does not have a relation to actual physical health. It has only a relation to how you feel. While this is good in situations involving purely psychological problems, such as pain and addiction, this is NOT good in situations pertaining to actual physical problems. Consider the possibility of someone experiencing organ failure, but they do not know their organs are failing because of the placebo effect from faith/mind games/etc. In such a case, of course, the placebo effect is a bad thing, for it obviously is a mental trick that is an ultimate detriment to your health.	The example you've given is not a placebo effect, it's a patient not understanding and diagnosing their own disease when they need to.  The placebo effect cannot be used to describe a situation where someone is being ignorant of their own condition with faith and mind games, as there are no physician(s) providing that deception.  Of course, a competent doctor would never provide a placebo for something like an organ failure. I believe placebos are only used in minor ailments, otherwise it would be providing alternative, often unproven medicine. If placebos are indeed used in such cases, it would only be to relieve pain and suffering, not as a treatment to get rid of the source of problem.	2
Well really it's better than a sitting army. Who's going to take them seriously if they were?	Dang. I wanted a serious debate and its gone. WHO CARES?!??!!!? I just want the points.	2
Yes. That's what natural selection is for. Chill it out and let evolution do its thang.	That's only assuming that what we define as intelligence is beneficial enough within our society structure to disrupt our evolutionary stable system, which I doubt.	2
Why not offer him a drink and find out? X) And I wonder who you could POSSIBLY be talking about ;)	LMAO! Actually, if Garry could stop all his hatin' on America long enough to have a drink or six, I'd bet that he'd be a very fun person.	2
Yes they can.	Please share some of your genius with me then. I'm dying to hear how this can work.	2
Obviously life can't be explained in a few experiments. There are several of them. These 2 new developments in tandem with experiments in the past should collectively prove life's formation. We have: 1. Replicated, mapped, created (in various parts with relatively simple methods to that of most technology today), anything-else-ed life in various forms. 2. There is an extensive fossil record with plenty of transitional fossils. 3. We've documented all of the necessary processes of evolution in action and seen natural selection take its course countless times. You all forget, experiments like this take place in what represents a puddle or so in a few days of testing, imagine the probabilities involved with the surface area of the ENTIRE GLOBE over EONS. Seriously. Guys. It's like Wheel of Fortune where there's one letter left, just solve the damn puzzle.	I don't think Pyg (and Cerin for that matter) was objecting to evolutionary arguments. He was more saying that we can't draw such a full conclusion from limited data. Just a call for logical parsimony. We can't prove that life was created in such a way. We can only prove that we can create life in a lab setting. Seriously. Guys. It's like Wheel of Fortune where there's one letter left, just solve the damn puzzle. Although that is the phrase of the year. I'm gonna have to use that.	2
We're getting close to successfully creating a healthy clone of a human being, if that counts.	Scientists are able to create a human. To create the human body. That is incredibly awesome - but what they haven't done yet are to give life to the human body they made. That is still known as impossible.	2
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. May or may not have been intentional :)	Ooopsie, I did it again!! Guilty of another up-vote for you! :)	2
God didn't give you the gift of curiosity, just to get mad when you use it.	How do you know God gave you this gift? Maybe Satan gave people the gift of curiosity???	2
"Nah, I mean, this is like the cigarette tax. It will only deter those who aren't super serious about it, and those people don't really need to be deterred, anyway, and will likely continue their routine. I very rarely eat ""junk food,"" but, for example, I visited McDonald's at 2am on my way home from an AC/DC concert. Even if there were a tax, I would've stopped. These ""punishment taxes"" really don't seem too effective."	They're not effective at all. I completely agree with you. I almost never eat fast food, but when I do, price is not an option. It's the cheapest food around to begin with and if I'm so hungry that I have to eat McDonald's (which I haven't in years :D), I'll just get the healthiest item on the menu, whether that's a chicken sandwich or a salad or whatever.  And cigarette taxes don't deter me from smoking- health risks deter me from smoking and I'm sure most people who don't smoke would say the same.	2
My point is that the majority of the people around you ARE Christian and they DO celebrate Christmas... unless you live in Asia or the Middle East/North Africa.  You made it seem as if Christianity is a minority where you live.	You may have read that into what I wrote, but I never said that nor was it remotely my intention to imply it. All I ever said was that the majority of the world was not Christian.	2
No thanks, a link should have been supplied.	<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest'>Here.	2
Troll debate?	Look like it. 	2
LOL! Dude, you park it in the yard ?	Well in the garage covered up I take good care of my girl.	2
Our way of life is broke and outdated it's time we evolve to the next stage of human evolution before it's to late.	I didn't watch the video, so if that is important then sorry lol. But anyways... What do you think a world without money would be like?	2
As I said, it is a mixture if the two. We know better and don't want to do it. The reason that we don't want to do it is because we think that the things that are not better are actually better. For example, person A knows that stealing is wrong. However, he has a desire for it. He steals something because he wants to steal it and thinks that it is good in some sort of sense: let us say that it will make him feel powerful. Therefore, he knew that it was wrong and knew better; however, he did that which was not better because he desired something that he thought would be better. It is a mixture if the two.	"That it's a mixture of the two, is a given. Otherwise the debate title would have asked ""which statement about humanity is true"" instead of ""Which statement about humanity is more true"" If you think wrong doing is almost always accompanied by a lack of understanding of the depth of the consequences (and it seems from your arguments that you do), then it follows that you believe statement ""A"" is more true."	2
Don't worry, I've overlooked many more obvious things before, I just felt the need to say why I left that one. And it was kind of funny that you took him seriously, to be honest.	I'll accept that one. I can't believe I missed the little face on the end of his statement. I need a nap...	2
Ah, duh! New Years EVE LOL! I don't know why I looked at that and thought New Years DAY? The Holiday season is from late November to early January, right? So, Thanksgiving (which has religious roots) but is often celebrated in a secular manner. Christmas and Hanukkah. I believe there's also an Islamic holiday in December and New Years in January, which also happens to have religious roots, since it was originally dedicated to the Roman god Janus, who also happens to be the god who the Romans named January after. Either way you look at it, these holidays have religious origins and were once or still are, Holy-Days.	Weeeellll...those are pretty valid points actually. But considering that several of these are practiced secularly (hell, even Christmas can be), I always found the term Happy Holidays to be essentially secular in meaning. I kind of thought that was the point of it. But I can see the connotation you are highlighting. Jace appears to feel the same way. Its weird, you are the first two I have ever encountered to look at it that way (that I know of, of course). I wonder how common it is. I kind of want to poll people on this now...	2
If you crashed into something, your mom would never have a chance to hold you in your seat. You become really heavy when you are moving, the faster you move, the more you weigh. So if you fly out through a window of a car when it crashes, you probably will weigh over 200 pounds - even if you are a little kid. So your mother would never have been able to hold you back, at the weight of over 200 pounds.	I guess she was also jerking forward, so would she be about 1000 pounds to stop him.	2
That maybe true, but where has it occurred? 	In you. You experience it. You are currently experiencing emotion. If you are asking me a question you may be experiencing an emotion only you cam define.	2
If everyone was to demand that those who injure them in any way receive punishment in the form of the same injury, yes, that would be extremely detrimental to society. Luckily, that's not the way most of us live. In theory, an eye for an eye would make the whole world blind, but that's not a practice that most put to use.	if an eye for and eye makes the whole world blind, then none of us would have any eyeballs left to see if anyone else were blind. anyway, i agree with you. living like that would suck.	2
That's silly. Just give them Jobs .	OK. Can we then take out the ones who refuse to work ;)	2
I think Christianity describes a group of people with varying beliefs who for whatever reason wish to identify as Christian.	I do Believe Church is Important For Christians But It is Not A Matter of Salvation.	2
Obviously, why wouldn't it be? Exterminating this group would lead to a better universe because no longer would Jews be looking for a homeland that doesn't exist because nobody likes them.	Quite true. Though I think his initial plans to send them all to Madagascar would have been a little less drastic :L   Though obviously I am completely opposed to what the Zionists are doing to the Palestinians and am not gonna bother hiding it just because some lanky twat somewhere says I'm 'racist' for not liking a certain religion. Not that I particularly like any religion :L OFF TOPIC so I think most of what Hitler did was wrong, but in schools they all teach that Hitler used the Jews as scapegoats for the first world war, even though all the leading bankers of the time were Jewish and all responsibly for the banking crash. In that aspect he was right. But killing them all?? Too far.	2
No way. That would be brutalic especially since lots of things can bring you cancer like the sun, cigarettes, etc. Also how would you prove that it was or was not hereditary?	Good point.	2
"For sure. I mean, of course it would be better for people to actually go through the trouble of searching if a debate has already been created, but most people just stick to the homescreen.

HITLER WAS A RIGHT-WING FASCIST ANY HISTORIAN KNOWS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I'm sorry you can't use facts or logic to convey your point and have to resort to typing in all caps like a 5 year old.  Allow me to reiterate, Hitler was fiscally liberal, Hitler was a socialist and Hitler nationalized most of Germany's economy. None of those are right-wing.	2
Oh come on! That is so childish! Better idea: spam her debates by posting random things in ALL CAPS and links to animal porn. Much less childish...	I'll support that except the animal porn. This is a family site ;)	2
I hold natural rights to be inherent to a rational human being. By which I mean that a human being properly using the faculties of his mind to assess his well-being naturally comes to conclusions about means to promote that well-being when in contact with other human beings. If we are not dealing with a rational individual who isn't concerned with his well-being, than no, natural rights are not an inherent part of how we interact with him.	I'll take it. I 100% agree with and applaud your statement. :)	2
I was bored on an online class, and so I was searching debating websites. Because I enjoyed a debating class I had a year before, plus I wanted some perspective on my senior project. And this is what I got. Well, the second thing I got. I was first brought to debate.org, but liked it here better :)	I was also brought to debate.org but I was there for a few days and then decided to search for a better debate site and sure enough this one is better than debate.org.:D	2
Looking at your profile PA, you do pretty well in the down voting department too, LOL!!!	I've been having to lately! But I don't just downvote all willy nilly. For things like that guy who added an argument in my debate that was all text speak and no substance, and pygs arguments that have no actual facts or reasons in them, just opinion. And opinions are fine, in opinion based debates. Also I downvoted joe for spamming... But I upvoted him too.	2
Lol. That one dude looks likes he's flying.  Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No!

It's still murder, but the punishment should not be the same as the punishment for cold-blooded killings. It's a very different situation that requires a much less severe punishment, meaning not death. :)	But why shouldn't that person be charged with manslaughter? I mean they killed someone. I can understand if it was an accident like as in me and you are having a fist fight and I punch you in your head and you fall and bust your head open on the corner of a table, and die. To that I would not charge with death. But for someone to murder someone they love no matter how mad they are is just wrong on all counts and if you can kill someone you love you could kill anyone. I say a crime of passion should be considered as manslaughter.	2
Well, I'm not sure what you're disputing here? But, no, I didn't know you were Muslim.	Because its a Yes and No situation. Its not always gonna be Muslim or Muslima. And so, Ismaila is right that females are called Muslima but just not all the time.	2
That doesnt do anything. It just melts the ice and drops you into the freezing cold water.	You owned him. xD	2

Well when you look at their capabilities, they both seem extremely powerful, but there are several ways to get around their abilities. Kururai mainly uses his speed to get around, but Koguja has clairvoyance. Kururai follows the laws of physics (for the most part) and has a hard time being able to see where he's going. He must predict where to stop, etc.. Also, in the RP, you can be extremely powerful, but the moderators on it limit how powerful you can be. For example, there is one person who can copy other's abilities, and turns into glass right before dying :/ Kururai actually obtained a lot of those stronger abilities throughout playing the RP, eventually learning things. Koguja's name means Collector, which hints at his multiple weapons with sealing capabilities. He essentially collects weapons with the ability to seal another's ability. The fairest I can see the battle happening is: Koguja uses his Zanpakuto and seals Kururai's speed. He uses another sword and seals Kururai's aether control. After, Koguja seals Kururai's instant heal. All Kururai has left is Dragon shouts, luck, teleportation, and a vast amount of weapons (and of course, basic things that come with his weapons, like Kido (Zanpakuto) and Keyblade Magic (Keyblade)) Koguja still has spell casting, dragon shouts, arrancar/SOLDIER physique, and clairvoyance (basic other stuff such as Keyblade Magic and Kido)	The sad thing is that one spellform would take both of them out from my character. And he isn't even overpowered. However, I'm sure that wouldn't be allowed. As for both of the character, I still say they're too overpowered. If that's the premise of the RP, fine, but it can't really be that interesting in any case. There's no room for character development.	2
What does that mean, sorry I don't get it. Can you please explain by what you mean.	Really On The Floor Laughing My Ass Off	2
Edit: Ignore this, I realize the error of my ways __--_____----- - - - - - - -	"I don't really think there's any proof that he did unless he admits it. If you click on his score (next to his user name) you get a full breakdown of his activities. You'll see that recently he has downvoted 4 arguments on the ""Is prostitution the ultimate victimless crime"" debate, without having added a single argument of his own."	2
it helps prevent racism because it will create more mixed children which will mean everybody is basically the same So you think the solution for racism is to make everyone the same?	I am not sure which part you don't like. I believe it is obvious that if everyone is the same that there won't be racism. Please let me know if you are disputing that. I think that solution would work, but I don't believe that is the solution we should use to get rid of racism. I think that interracial marriages are good and having everyone be the same would get rid of racism, so interracial marriages should be supported for that reason. I don't know how to get rid of racism. Education is a working well. But, I think the best thing for racism would be uniformity. If we have a bunch of different groups who don't want to assimilate with each other I believe we will have more racism. So, I guess I do think making everyone the same is the solution.	2
I just picked a side so I could comment. .	So, do you agree or disagree that this was a racially based attack? 	2
Actually, they both killed about 25% during the war. Then when you add in the gulags, famines and purges from the USSR, Stalin (and Lenin for that matter as well) did far more damage to the Ukraine. Also, I'm not just making this up, my family has some roots in the Ukraine and some of my relatives were there during WWI and WWII, the Russians were worse.	"My dad's girlfriend grew up in the Soviet Union, and her mother was AAA gunner in Stalingrad.  Though, the ""Russian's"" weren't worse than the Nazis. They did not systematically exterminate entire races, the gulags were more rehabilitate, though they were ghastly. P.S. Stalin was a Georgian."	2
That is a view I can agree with.	Good, someone WHO agrees. Edit overspending and saves. Damn smartphone keyboard.	2
I sure hope so. Religion is a tool of oppression. People should believe in God, not religion.	Why did you delete your challenge debate? I was adding an argument.	2
Yes it is going to fail based on what happened at E3 and how the NSA is going to be spying on you when you have the kinect on and when you're on skype and you make calls. I would laugh so hard if the Xbox One got hacked.  PS4 will be the best selling next-gen console and will outsell Xbox One on day 1.	You have no idea how happy I am to see that the Xbox-one is failing. I hate Microsoft. It has always been my life long dream for them to stop making consoles. No seriously it is. Why you may ask? Well first off with Microsoft out of the console Market competition,Nintendo and Sony's consoles will up in sales. Not only that but I heard Sega say that if one of the competitors leaves the console market. They said they would work on making a new console.	2
Lol, we finally agree on something. First time for everything.	Well shit me not. That is cool. .	2

The rapture is one of the many ideas of Christianity which make me dislike it. I dislike that mortals with a limited lifespan and no access to this all powerful being in this limited life, should be punished for eternity for not blindly following. It's counter-human to do such, leading me to believe this all powerful entity really doesn't like his creation, would rather us be something else. Faced with proof that what I see now as fanciful human imagination, were true, would not make the fundamentals of what I dislike of this religion any different. If anything the fact of such a thing happening would increase my disdain for this tyrannical being. The truth of it increasing my ire more than fantasy could.	Indeed; arguing on purely logical grounds as well, why would God select some to be assumed to heaven and leave others behind when (assuming the rapture to be physical), transporting all humankind there would serve as definitive, absolute proof of God's existence; isn't the selective nature of the rapture a kind of penalty for disbelief in the first place?	2
So are you a communist? If so what type ?	No, I am not a Communist, but I am a Socialist. Communism seems too difficult to achieve, though different forms of Socialism can be done. I like Democratic Socialism, and some of the models used in Tito's Yugoslavia.	2
Where did you see me trolling in this debate? Until you point to it, you're just a bullshitter.

I dissagree, fear is the root of much evil, but greed and pride do a great part of it as well.	fear is just one factor that leads to evil. other factors are ignorance, greed, anger, past wrongs, and circumstance	2
No, not necessarily. I usually try to understand things, but some things are worth hating, and it's not ignorance. I hate the devil. I hate evil and cruelty.	Soooo.... we have a new spaghetti head on CD. Kudos.	2
You can't blame your self for your fathers doing, I don't know your family condition's maybe he was doing it because it was the only way he knew. I couldn't say too much but kids failing on their parents? I can see this in a way, from what I know of my father and his kids, they are very unruling and don't listen much. I think they really need a wake up call I wish I had a dad to be there for me. They had both their parents their entire life that took care of them and I had only my mother that I had to take care of my entire life. I've always thought children like that needed more discipline but maybe they just need more love. Maybe they feel they aren't really loved by their parents for some reason. Which coming from me seems surprising when it feels like I got love from neither of my parents. Everyone only has one life though they can't possibly see things like I do through my life.	I agree with you. I just feel like I could have done something. Just about anything different. Anything. I feel like there is burden on me for not stopping him or trying to distract him that day.	2
I'm agnostic and I've never claimed to be more moral than anyone and I also am not one of the people passing out all the down votes. I'm conservative and most of my friends are Christian... That's fine by me. Not all Agnostics and Atheists are as radical as some on this site.	What beliefs somebody has doesn't matter. What does matter is when one's belief is as self-righteous as some of the atheist here, the difference between them and the religious extremist is none. Al qaida with a different name. An extremist is an extremist.	2
You seem to be under the common misconception that marriage is a religious term. It isn't. If you do a quick search on the history of marriage you'll find that it predates recorded history. There are records of marriage as old as 2350 BC, long before your religion even existed, and it has taken many forms throughout history including polygamy, polygyny, polyandry, endogamy, exogamy, common law marriage, monogamy, arranged marriage, and same sex marriage. It wasn't until 325 AD that Christian churches became involved in marriage. Before that it was thought of as a primarily private matter with no religious ceremony being required. Even today marriage is not strictly tied to religion. No religious ceremony is required to get married.	I do agree that marriage existed before say, Christianity. But religion was the precursor of, and existed before, government. Shamans ran the tribe through superticious mumbo jumbo. And the concept of marriage existed then in order to maintain the tribe united. You can't have in fighting among the men over the women. Even in ancient tribes that exist today (in Africa, and the Amazon jungle), which are more like single family communes that interact with other family communes, they too have a concept of marriage and no government. Government is only needed to maintain large societies.	2

Really? Being close minded has nothing to do with you accepting the common views of this modern society. Its really about if you change your mind easily or how well you analyze another person's point of view. You being pro all those things doesn't make you open minded, it really just says that you easily accept whatever theory floats around in the atmosphere and then cling to it until another movement comes.	Bull fucking shit. You do not have the right to judge me. I believe whatever the fuck I want, not what floats around. If you respond to this, I will report you.

"Yep :) You need the seedling first, and this takes nutrients from the soil. But soil cannot produce this on it's own. Trees die, decompose, and this is soil. Trees on their own can turn to soil. Soil on it's own cannot turn to trees. If you think otherwise, please state why, instead of just asking if "" I'm sure"" or not.."	"If you think otherwise, please state why, instead of just asking if "" I'm sure"" or not.. So it's wrong to ask for your reasoning behind the statement? >.>"	2
"The literal way to understand that statement doesn't imply a value judgment. Specifically, saying that you have a certain amount of points doesn't imply that it's good or amazing to have that amount of points. The implication that the amount of points is good or amazing can be the intention of the teller or imbedded in the tone of how the teller says it. However, the sentence itself ""I have 23,600 points"" includes neither of those elements. The statement is merely a claim on a fact about the world."	So it's OK that I'm a point whore as long as I don't do my little happy points dance where everyone can see ;)	2
Yeah, yeah... I know that... that slut Mary... but I'm talking about God! Who gave birth to him?	No one gave birth to God because He has always been there.  	2
Yes, because if a woman can choose to kill an inconvenient child, then why not make a loved one? If a woman has a choice of when and how she has children, then she has the right to make children she wants and can afford. We allow women to terminate pregnancies that are unwanted. We allow them to give away unwanted children through adoption. If a woman can choose to kill an inconvenient child, why not make a loved one? Why not allow a willing woman to carry her sterile sister's child? Why not allow an older woman to carry her infertile daughter's baby? As long as all parties consent, voluntary surrogacy is as much a woman's choice as abortion. Until there are viable and successful artificial wombs, surrogate motherhood is the only option for a biological family unit's creation in some cases. Why deny them that choice, when killing unwanted children is allowed?	AigerimKul, I completely agree with your statement! there are a lot of horrible things allowed, so I also think that somewhere in a deep, surrogacy is a kinda volunteering, helping interfrile couples to fell yhe joy of parenthood, by the way, motherhood in general is the best quality which characterizes all women in the world, no matter how they want to realize their motherhood, more important is their willing to do it!	2

Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	Can I ask what you think will happen to non believers after they die?	2

True, however that's not the point of the debate. The point is that she's taking offense to a prayer and has taken specific action to make it not be allowed. However, if a Christian takes offense to an atheist and even thinks about saying something they're all of a sudden a bigot.	You are correct, the government cannot prohibit a person from exercising their right to pray, but only if it is private prayer on their own merits. The constitution also prohibits the establishment and/or endorsement of any religion at the state or federal level. If a politician wants to pray, thats ok, but to mandate christian prayer at a political conference is violating the establishing clause in the constitution. How would you feel if they had a mandated Muslim prayer?	2
I feel that you're making some sort of a point here but I can't be sure what it is. However I don't think you're on topic. Can the assassination of a dictator be justified or not?	My point is off target a little because the point that I was trying to make is the opposite of assassination of a dictator. The United States Government sponsored the removal of a Democratic Socialist, Salvador and replaced him with a dictator, Pinochet which in turn Pinochet killed about 4000 and tortured 30000 Chileans because they were left socialist and rebels against the coup, yet he died recently before he faced any repercussions.	2
Ha! Well according to the video that goes with that link Martin is 320 pounds... I just rounded it off. Once one reaches 300lbs I didn't think the extra 20 really mattered.	It sounds a lot like what I heard about Ryan Leaf. The veterans go out to eat and run up the bill and have the rookies pay for it. I guess these guys went too far.	2

I think it could help, but people will always find something to be prejudiced about. I really don't understand why the world hasn't adopted a common language by now. They tried it once and it failed miserably. I forget what it was called.  It seems like English is the predominant language, but the English language is a mess. For every rule there is an exception, and for every exception there is an exception. Multiple letters have the same sound, and multiple sounds have the same letter. There are too many words that sound exactly the same, but have completely different meanings. It's just a disaster. We need a language that has consistent rules and an alphabet that has only one letter for each sound. Schools should teach the current language for each country along with a new universal language, so eventually one day in the future we will be able to go to any country and still be able to communicate with each other.	Yes, people will always have their discrepancies, I think deep down we're savages who like controversy. I actually made a mock debate about that. lol. I think a universal language wouldn't work for a few reasons. People like their own, and they wouldn't feel a need to learn another language to speak to people they'll never meet when they already know their own and speak to people they know. The exceptions bit about English made me laugh also. There are so many silent letters, and homonyms. As for this part :Schools should teach the current language for each country along with a new universal language, so eventually one day in the future we will be able to go to any country and still be able to communicate with each other. I love that idea, and I love the topic. You should make a debate of that, I'll visit it and leave my views.	2
Yes if you are defending your self and someone is trying to kill you.  	Again yes I would agree that would seem to me to be morally right	2

I completely agree. And I also simultaneously know that Israel has already finalized its plan to strike Iran with nuclear tipped missiles. What I don’t know, however, is what will trigger the execution of that plan. Obviously we are not, as a country, troubled by Israel’s plan to bomb Iran, with nuclear weapons, but we certainly are troubled by Iran’s intention to finalize the necessary parts for a plan to bomb Israel.  Did I ever mention that I am impervious to fear and war-mongering?  Also, did you know that there is a population of about 25,000 Jews in Iran who are quite comfortable living in Iran? It’s as though 25,000 Jews are telling the world that they feel safe and sound in their home, Iran, despite what the world press and media fills the air-waves with. Hell, the damned constitution of Iran protects, specifically, Jews. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews  Note: Without taking the time to cite the source, I do know that Israel will pay Jews to move to the mother-land. Yet, there are very few takers. Take that for what it is worth.	Israel attacking Iran with nuclear tipped missiles would be a disaster. They should be able to achieve their goals with conventional weapons. The trigger is the tricky part. When they attacked Iraq's nuclear reactor, it was above ground. Iran will build it underground and fortify it. The U.S. is troubled because the we don't want a disruption to our oil supply plus we are already deeply in debt and can't afford another war. Especially one of that magnitude. I think that if Iran got the bomb it would probably give a dirty bomb to the terrorists instead of taking out Israel. A war by proxy is better than the condemnation of the world if they were to attack Israel. They are already bitching about the 4th round of sanctions. ;)	2

"I'd like to thank my opponent for his response. I will now reply to his second round. My opponent begins his round: ""You may have pointed out some of the flaws I had made, but it seems that you do not have a strong conviction to support mixed races, you are just someone with a neutral will."" I'm not the one attempting to affirm a resolution here, you are, so my position on the matter is irrelevant. I do not need to prove mixed race couples are beneficial, I simply need to show that your arguments fail to affirm the resolution. I can take a neutral position (even if it's against what I personally believe) and still do so. ""I do not see any benefits being made from mixed races. No matter which races are merged in, they are inferior due to the fact they lack loyalty in their country."" Firstly, the resolution seeks to deny the ability for mixed race marriages, therefore it is incumbent upon my opponent to show why these marriages are harmful, not why the alternative is beneficial. Secondly, my opponent needs to show why they are inferior in any way, and why loyalty to country matters and how being in a mixed race marriage in any way shows one is not loyal to their country. Furthermore, for example, the United States is not a ""white people"" country. It is a country of more than one ethnicity. One could certainly marry outside of whatever their ethnicity is, and still be extremely loyal to their country. This is true of any other country as well. ""These men are from First-world countries, therefore they go overseas to work."" Who are these men? What exactly are you talking about here? And why does it matter? ""If these men have opportunities to work overseas, that means that they are both rich and on a prominent position."" Once again, how does this pertain to the resolution? ""Do you want these good men to make children with women that does not have value in position or occupation?"" Why not? ""The child is not going to belong in the fatherland that has provided all for him/her."" The child will belong to whatever country he/she was born in, if one can say that a child ""belongs"" to any country at all. ""Populations of first-world countries are decreasing due to the fact that men go overseas without making children with his own people."" We'll need to see some data, otherwise this is just a random assertion that doesn't back up the resolution. Even if we assume this is true, it doesn't necessarily advance the resolution regardless. ""Everybody loves these children just because of how they were born. They are likely to escape unemployment, because many people are wanting to hire them for their education, talent, and so on."" We'll need to see some data for this assertion to be backed up and relevant to the resolution. ""This makes the people born in unfortunate circumstances hard to find jobs."" Being a child of a mixed race couple does not make it inherently more difficult for one to find a job. Provide some data on this please. ""Thus the children of these people are in such fortunate state that they can evade military service and poverty."" I'm not sure how this follows the assertion just before it, but it certainly doesn't advance the resolution. ""Think of all the soldiers that fought for their country. Do these children have the same loyalty as they do?"" Why wouldn't they? Ethnicity/race is not the same as nationality. Because one is of mixed ethnicity does not mean they wouldn't have the same sense of national pride as anyone else. Even if they didn't, it still wouldn't justify banning mixed-race marriages on a local or global scale. My opponent has the burden of proof in this debate to show that we should ban mixed-race marriages and to provide good justifications for doing so. So far he has not done that, he asserts that mixed race children will be unemployed and will not be loyal to their country without providing any evidence for this. I will conclude my round here and I look forward to my opponent's final round."	fuck it im forfeiting someone else argue with this guy i can never dispute him	2

Really, when we start being honest with each other, what most people resent about abortion is that the system not really fair. I mean you have the right to kill your kid before he's born, but I don't have the right to kill mine afterwards. I mean if you can't kill your own kid, who the hell can you kill. First, you try reduction of privileges. You take the car keys from him, but that just doesn't work. And it would be so much easier to kill him, because he's really fucking up my life now. I mean think what I could be if I didn't have this kid up in my grill. I might even go back to school and get a law degree. Save more money. Retire better. But I got this government telling me that he has rights and shit. I can't kill him, because it's immoral, etc. etc. What a bunch of horse shit!	It's much worse than that. Let's say that you (as a man) kill your unborn fetus by punching your wife in the stomach. Now..., you would expect that you would be charged only with assault. But you would be wrong. You would be charged with murder. Now let's say that the reason you punched her in the stomach was because you wanted her to have an abortion and she refused. Well..., you are not allowed to request an abortion. Only she can. Now let's say that you wanted her to have an abortion because you did not want to provide child support. Well..., if she wants to keep the baby, you are required to pay child support. Let me put it this way..., Men and women are equal but women are more equal than men. ;) Here's another way to look at it..., men are forced to take responsibility for their actions. Women..., are not. ;)	2

Genesis 1:14-19 KJV And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. God used the lights he had already created to signify light and day. In Hebrew creation is the creation act. Made is a purpose declaration act.	A firmament never existed at any time. Light cannot come before the sun. A God didnt poof the world into existence. 2 people didnt give birth to the entire lineage of the human race. The world was never flooded. THeres no evidence for a god poofing anything into existence ever. A pile of dirt cannot form into a man nor the ingredients in dirt. Likewise woman cannot come from 1 rib bone. Evolution does not in any way corrolate with genesis nor does the big bang. You made that up and are wrong.	2
Pope Francis is wrong. You can't get into Heaven if you believe God doesn't exist, believe in mohammad, buddha, allah, etc.  Jesus Christ said, No one can come to the Father but through ME. Basically saying you only have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to get to heaven. It sickens me how people try to twist God's words and make it sound that its easy to get into heaven. Its very hard to get into heaven and only a few find the path there.	"Actually, although believing in God and that Athiests will not go to heaven, I must dispute and declare that God, Allah, and Muhammad are the same person. Different religions just praise Him in different ways.  Back to the Atheists thing, I don't think that Atheists go to heaven, but I don't think God would put them in hell if they were good people. I think they would go to a ""purgatory"" like setting where they would repent for not believing and eventually get into heaven."	2

If it's started it hasn't hit me yet. I have noticed increasing gas prices, but that's always been constantly going up.

Before taking any step towards the beginning of a sex education in Brazilian schools, it is necessary to have an educational policy involving the Ministry of Education and Culture – MEC –, Psychologists and Psychotherapists and parents, as well as the schools´ representatives, in a way that a joint action is set within society. Today’s Brazilian schools do not have enough resources and support to introduce the sex education subject in schools, because there is no adequate support material neither a general standard established on what the teachers would use in class. Besides, as they are not always trained how to properly teach sex education, they start to pass on their own morals and beliefs which may go against the individual's moral and religious beliefs, as well as differ from family values and background education. Sex education should be taught at home by the children's parents since having it in schools does not substitute the family’s role on that issue, and at the same time both, parents and educators do not believe in the co-responsibility work. Some say that sex education encourages teenagers to start their sex life earlier than recommended. These so-called “classes”, for instance describing step-by-step how to use a condom, would instigate their curiosity impelling them to having thoughts and actions not proper for their age. How many teachers and instructors feel prepared for this task?  Isabela2E Simone2E	Sex education is a role for the children's parents, It's something natural but personal.  In schools they should only teach the science involving sex.	2
I would prefer to live under a dictator. Lets take Fidel Castro, a good person, but technically a dictator, given when he roes to power he was not elected.

"Why would the Jews follow him if his miracles didn't happen? Their were many self proclaimed Jesuses before and after, but only Jesus of Nazereth moved the Jews to the point of conversion. Except the Jews who didn't believe him... the same argument can be used for Muhammad, in both cases we have people following someone, that doesn't mean they are divine or ever did anything supernatural. All you keep saying is ""I don't know therefore he was God.""  It is much more probable that Jesus was a wizard who mislead people, even more probable is that he was raised by a mother who told him he was the son of God, and he acted on how he was raised.

Hello. I believe that it is bgitoed to deny gays rights, but at the same time, I believe that it is bigoted to force people to live a certain way if they are not truly hurting anyone.

"Monks meditate to center the mind so that its not storming around, in complete stress due to reality's circumstances, (work environment, financial issues). The whole point of them meditating is to calm themselves down and see things from another perspective that isn't stuck in the moment, that would let them live healthy and stress free, which in turn promotes longevity of life. Its not some mystical power they spew out that gives them an advantage. In addition, not all forms of ""meditation"" are exactly ""healthy"" nor truly help the ""longevity"" unless its applied under scientific theory, otherwise its just ""assumption""; trial and error.  As for traditional herbal medicine, this came from first hand experience, that humans said over time ""this and that, remedies this"" they did not ""mystically"" figure this out. They had to learn it by a common hypothesis and conclusion, that if so and so herbs are applied to this symptom, it will cure it."	Most people meditate to calm themselves from worldly problem but not monks. Some (and some non-monks) meditate for spiritual enlightenment by achieving nirvana or eternal peace as achieved by Buddha. Most consider him an exception with unspeakable talent beyond normal grounds. Not mystical? My friend, mysticism is a field yet to be validated. Consider 'silly'. Shaolin monks trained on meditation as much as the art of fighting. Using trained inner energy their punch could reach three fold the amount of a human with their same muscle mass. If science (dominated by the west) could spend more time on it then it would be such a big deal since we are not just made up of a sack of meat.	2

The bible does not prove everything, it is a book for Christians about Jesus and other Christian related things. There are no science facts in the Bible, therefore no conclusion of whether dinosaurs exist or not can be found in the book.	He was just playing devils advocate, as well as parodying a bible thumpers response. It was entirely facetious on Cuaroc's part.	2
childrens need to do more exercises and study well , not only to watch T.V .	I strongly believe that TV does more harm than good because due to TV there are some kids that are lacking focus in life and in school and this is blamed from TV. This can be due to not completing homework because they want to watch TV or that TV teaches us things that are wrong like influencing people to do bad things.	2
People lose their ability to trust from being hurt too much and just give up. they have no fight left in them. They are numb, merely existing.	I agree with her, the idea of attaining 'true love' drives some people crazy and when they do think they finally attained it they are really attached to that person. Not that being overly attached is a bad thing but it affects one's judgement for sure	2
I would tell you to your face but you keep hiding from me :P	Well, you keep finding me so I must not be hiding very well ?	2
An absolute monarch had much more structure in its power. The divine right was passed down by heritage keeping that belief strong. This opens your span of control.	Yea that divine right was all well and good, until believers of other religion comes along, then you have people fighting against one another while any outsider can look for the weak spots and attack. Or in the case of America and Britain could end up leaving. I'd weigh the power of these two all powerful governments by the victories of modern day. Monarchies have the British. Dictatorships have North Koreans. North Korea never had any major parts defect. Britain did.	2

Good point.	She does make a good point. I think some cancers may be identifiable such as maybe lung cancer from smoking or skin cancer from UV Rays but other that that I am not sure.	2
You don't have a clue what I was referring to. 	I guess I dont could you please clarify for me. .	2
Mmm... I'll have to look up what obamacare means. I like the NHS system in Britain where our taxes pay for the upkeep of hospitals, so everyone can afford healthcare.	I like the idea of working with hospitals. Here we change the system so we can work with insurance companies more.  Do you have a harder time affording things by paying more in taxes?	2
I don't think the creator meant a few spelling errors. I'm pretty sure you're safe from being 'broken', as you used proper punctuation, and seem to be the kind of person who would type in paragraphs. As for the argument, I believe that poor grammar can destroy respect, especially on a site like this. wen u teyep like ths w/out ne cair 4 spling or gramar its hard 2 take u srsly	That's exactly what I meant. I've recently seen someone on here type like you demonstrated and I seriously didn't care to decode it because I thought what they were saying would be ridiculous like her grammar.	2
I really like Darker than Black, hence the profile picture. It's the small, meaningful series' I like, Death Note, Utawarerumono, Vampire Knight, Sword Art Online, etcetera. Cartoons are mainly just childish from the ones I remember. They didn't convey a deep storyline... more animals wearing clothes hitting each other, really.	WHY'D THEY HAVE TO STOP PRODUCING SWORD ART ONLINE! Cries xD	2
Why women in particular? I was introduced to Hydrogen peroxide as bleach at school.	Because, it is commonly used to remove bloodstains from panties and is just one example I was using. I apologize if any offense was taken. Comparing hydrogen peroxide to commercial bleach is like comparing chemical cleaning supplies to water + vinegar. It is the safer alternative. If you read the E-book i have linked up in the debate description you will notice that I am not saying to drink a 35% hydrogen peroxide solution but 0.006% which is saying a drop of food grade hydrogen peroxide into a big glass of water and drinking it down. This stuff is powerful and needs to be studied before used and respected.	2
"I can't get past   ""A revision of the Nazi heirarchy...in 1944 increased productivity by some 30%, which really gives an indication of the waste within nazi ranks. Of course, by that time, it was already too late."" I wasn't referring to something as abstract as organizational waste. I was referring to the ruthless efficiency involved in murdering human beings and disposing of their corpses as cheaply and quickly as possible. Generally, that's what people mean when they use ""Nazis"" and ""efficiency"" in the same sentence."	Yeah... but I was originally refering to organisational waste....	2
"Looking from the perspective of an etymologist, I'll have to take the ""no"" side. They can form a union, but ""marriage"" is not the accurate word for that. Marriage comes from the Latin words (rather, word-forms, for they both are derived from the same lammata) marita/meritus meaning wife/husband. Matrimonium essentially is that state from whence comes motherhood - an homosexual union precludes parenthood.  So, whilst I support the marriage-like union of the homosexual, I cannot support the actual marriage, for such is inconsistent with the etymology of marriage."	"Do you mean it is impossible to ""marry"" any way? because marriage derived from all that stuff you said?"	2
Moral questions cannot be proven or disproven, they are essentially feelings. So, my apologies, I still don't see how perspective apart from logic, evidence, or proof justifies a belief or helps us determine right in the meaning of fact or correct.	Sorry for the miscommunication,I thought we were talking about how moral questions are viewed as right or wrong, I agree that you can not deffinately prove one or th other.	2
I am just trying to clarify, do you think that you being christian is a Should be able to stop Gay people getting married?  If not I don't think you have a good argument against Gay marriage.	Well how about gay marraige isn't good because why do you need to get married it isn't like you can make babies, why not stay dating	2

A large group of informed people will have better judgment than an equally informed individual. That said, the masses tend not to be very well informed (although the internet is helping to change that).	"""A large group of informed people will have better judgment than an equally informed individual"" FAULTY ARGUMENT! INTELLIGENCE IS NOT DEPENDENT ON NUMBERS A GROUP OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE TENDENCY TO OVERRIDE OR UNDERMINE OTHER'S CONTRIBUTION FOR SELF-ADVANCEMENT... IT'S A DIFFERENT STUFF TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND TO BE WISE... THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE 1 PRESIDENT, 1 PRIME MINISTER, 1 DRIVER, 1 CEO.... YOU GET ADVICES, OK! BUT A BETTER JUDGMENT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE WITH INSTINCT.. AND THAT SELDOM HAPPENS IN A GROUP WHERE COMPETITION AND SURVIVAL IS COMMON HIDDEN AGENDA.."	2
"uh a gay person doesn't want to marry someone of the opposite sex. OK, so that's like saying, ""The law is that you can drink all the alcohol you want. But I don't want to drink alcohol. I want to smoke marijuana. My rights are being violated!"" Again, there are no two different rights. Marriage is not a right. It is sanctioned by a religion and a priviledge that the government can take away. That is why you need a marriage license to get married. You need a license because it is not a right. In order to adopt children, you must be a male and female couple. It does not say, you must be a heterosexual and a heterosexual female couple. A single heterosexual male cannot adopt. A single heterosexual female cannot adopt. It is not discrimination against gays."	OK! try to get this now, you said marriage is not a right, and government can not take away, well then how come only few states are allowing same-sex marriage, thats because it's more of a right then anything, that's the government rules over America. People save up for there weddings and stuff, but they don't want to over spend by leaving the country to go get married plus if they come back to the USA then there marriage is not legal. Have you ever heard of people getting married for the benefits? That's because the GOVERNMENT gives them those benefits because they are now a married couple!  and for the adopt thing. I'm talking about gay couple. not a single father or mother. two fathers. and for the whole alcohol and marijuana thing, wtf! those are to different things, so your comparing gays and str8's to beer and drugs... well either way, beer and drugs are one again two different things	2
From a debate website, this place has decayed into a trolling spree	yeah and it's sad that the 2 trolls Chuz and Prod made it so. 	2
If they do make a drug like that I doubt it would ever be made illegal.	That's the point XD lol, but there's also Shrooms, which are technically harmless depending on the amount your taking. And some other drugs are still useful for other things, such as medical marijuana.	2
Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. If you are able to safely close the distance between yourself and an attacker (which is required to apply an armbar), and the situation is life or death, there are other techniques (that also are not Jiu Jitsu) that would be more advisable. In a true rage...a hyper-extended elbow can be ignored.	Yes, there are other techniques but they are not as much fun ;)	2
Lol. Well it is what it is.	<a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Is_it_what_it_is'>Is it?	2

"Neither. The question should be: ""Which is Worse: Titanic or 2012?"" But i am assuming that is what you meant from the beginning. Well i am going to say, Titanic is worse. For one reason, 2010 has not happened yet. Second, 2012 might not going to happen."	"Oh man this was rich. For one reason, 2010 has not happened yet. You do realize that 2012 was a movie right? And just to let you know ( so we are on the same page ) we are in the year 2011. Second, 2012 might not going to happen. Well the year 2012 is inevitable, whether or not we as the human race make it their is what you could make an argument over. And it would be ""might not happen"", so take the ""going to"" right out of there."	2
I worship logic. Logic is everything that can be and is. Therefore logic is God. Logic is my religion.	"Methinks you are on to something with this line of thinking. The only issue that I see is your contention that you worship logic. I guess if we use the term worship very loosely, worship can refer to devotion to not just beings but principles and systems, but I tend to think of worship as maximal (I'd say excessive) valuing or devotion to a specific real or imaginary being. As an atheist, I have found no being that I consider to be worthy of worship, but I do recognize a ruling -principle- that I regard as being worthy of utter devotion. This principle is love, and is THE philosophical first principle. If love was ordinarily understood as the first principle of one's ""ruling logic"" or theology, and this principle was understood metaphorically as god, I think that today I'd be identifying as theist. What I'm wondering is...Can you articulate your ruling logic....or..... can you introduce me to your ""god""? :)"	2

Do you know why he stopped? Was the show cancelled or did he just throw in the towel?	From what I understand the network stopped the show due to a conflict of interest between Dave and the network that hosted the show, he just up and left to Africa, walked out on a 50 million dollar a year contract.	2
If they do make a drug like that I doubt it would ever be made illegal.	The legal status of drugs has very little to do with the harm they do to their users and the people around their users, otherwise there's no way alcohol and tobacco would be legal. Drugs that are legal are legal because of someones special interest, political gain, tradition, or greed. Drugs that are illegal are such for much the same reason, but you can also add fear and prejudice to the list.	2
No, the son of God is the only one that fits. His miracles cannot be denied by historians or philosophers of the time. The only reason he would've been followed by the Jews the way they did were if they saw his miracles and how he healed people physically, emotionally, and spiritually. He was the son of God because the demons themselves called him so.	There are no contemporary writings to the life of Jesus, the gospels weren't written by the authors they are attributed, and were written at least 30 years after the death of Jesus. I'm not saying Jesus didn't exist, only that textual evidence isn't sufficient to support the claim that he ever did miracles. You keep appealing to ignorance, you create a list and because he doesn't fit anything on the list he must be the son of God. That is a logical fallacy. Argument from incredulity/Lack of imagination Arguments from incredulity take the form: P is too incredible (or: I cannot imagine how P could possibly be true); therefore P must be false. I cannot imagine how P could possibly be false; therefore P must be true. These arguments are similar to arguments from ignorance in that they too ignore and do not properly eliminate the possibility that something can be both incredible and still be true, or appear to be obvious and yet still be false.	2
If we, without acceapting Jesus, sin. Then for those who don't will continue to sin in Heaven.	Well I guess that counts, if not accepting Jesus is a sin.	2
I do realize that, but I am not sure what your point is.	My point is that the majority of the people around you ARE Christian and they DO celebrate Christmas... unless you live in Asia or the Middle East/North Africa.  You made it seem as if Christianity is a minority where you live.	2
I don't disagree with that except that Turkey would be pissed if there was an independent Kurdistan and the Kurds would be pissed if they were handed over to Turkey... then what to do with Baghdad and how to split up the oil reserves... the whole Middle East is more big fucking mess.	I agree, the issue between the Kurds and Turkey is a little more complicated than the other areas, but given that the other areas were being broken up, something would have to be done with the Kurds, and I think giving them to Turkey is better than giving them to Syria or Iran. I also hadn't thought about Baghdad, and don't have an answer for that, but I also don't think one city should block a resolution that is good for the rest of the country. Even though Baghdad is diverse, I think the land around it is mostly Shiite (I'm not sure of that, it's been a while since I last saw maps that showed this stuff), so I think Baghdad would go to Iran. As for the oil reserves, I think they should just follow the land. There will obviously be a lot of arguing over borderline areas, and this is probably one of the reasons they didn't go this direction. However, I think the biggest reason we didn't divide up the country was that we're enemies with Syria and Iran, and we didn't want to give them anything. All in all, though, I agree with you that we could have avoided all of this mess had Iraq never been formed in the first place. I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it obviously hasn't worked out well.	2
First off you have to define what's a religion. A religion is man's way to get to god. Atheism is a belief that there is no god so it is not technically a religion since they don't believe in a god.	"Only one type of atheism holds a distinct belief that there are no gods. Most of atheism simply a label for those who reject the belief in a god. Other than that I pretty much agree. ""Religions"" that do not have a god are more philosophies than they are religions. But I guess by legal and dictionary they are still religions."	2

Hellno has severely bullied me, made fun of me, accused me of being a multi-accounter at a time when I was brand new, down-voted arguments of mine that deserved up-voting if anything, has engaged in gang bullying on me and others on this site and has acted like a complete ignorant Libertarian fucktard for his entire time on this site as far as I can see. I have every fucking right to hate him and just because YOU individually feel there are too many of these debates perhaps you should be posting this message on all of the 'I hate Prodigee' and 'Prodigee is a loser' type of debates that are far, far worse in both morality and validity.	"Actually, yes. I agree with you. I should and intend to post similar comments about how silly all these ""I hate X user"" posts, including those which are ""I hate Prodigee"". That said, it's to your benefit to ask yourself why are there so many posts which deride you."	2
Awwww, thanks hon You told me you hated that talk? Hmm, methinks we have a porky-pie in the house ;)	I don't like that talk when people are trying to be rude.	2
"This, ""Do you realize the fultility of debating whether or not god exists?"", does not follows from  this, ""God's existence is purely conceptual, or something more"" These are two completely different notions. God's existence can be purely conceptual and it can be non-futile to discuss Him (philosophers say that the exercise of any critical thought should be done, simply for the good of the mind and of reason; this is to be done regardless of the reality of the world, which is why we have an entire branch of logic that deals with possible worlds). God existence can be more than conceptual and it can be non-futile to discuss Him (if God does exist, then talking of Him is important). Simply by being capable of discussing God we find that God is at the least conceptual (siding with the ""Yes"" side). However, as shown above, the discussion of God is in no way futile (siding with the ""no"" side)."	"This, ""Do you realize the fultility of debating whether or not god exists?"", does not follows from this, ""God's existence is purely conceptual, or something more"" As far as you can tell. :)"	2
All of this prove to be a huge of time and waste where nothing will result into anything. Isn't Zimmerman Hispanic?	The media labeled him a white Hispanic. This is of course the only time that term has ever been used, weird.	2
So what else do you do to show compassion? Do you volunteer at the homeless shelter, or the senior center, or help inner-city youths? Are you adopting children in need?

Ask around buddy, there's plenty of nuts on this site that believe that	I'm a Christian and I believe in the facts of the old Testament... the thing is, some of it is opinions of the bigshots of the time and therefore 'has to be taken with a pinch of salt' as my mum says (that means that you shouldn't believe everything because some things in there are not true). Most of it is historical documentation and therefore is perfectly believable... the other half is rather dubious.	2

"Very interesting. Again though this is still saying that we didn't evolve from apes. It is more along the lines of ""retrovirus is what propagates evolution"" or at least higher forms of it in complex organisms."	Yes, I suppose if we keep to the exact wording of the debate title, then this probably should have been on the other side of the debate. I went more with what I though was the actual intent of the debate than the exact wording. I assumed he was more interested in knowing if humans and apes are related, but that may be an incorrect assumption.	2
They have the Teen Titans. I loved that show. I also loved the comic. Robin is such a stud.	Yeah, DC work together so damn well whereas Marvel are amazing solo. The problem with marvel characters is that, other than Hulk, most of them are just in it for themselves.	2

The scenario also describes the fate of the victim's family, a whole innocent family died because of the gangsters actions. Also if someone kill your child, it is likely the justice system would do justice, in the scenario the justice system failed, so the people thought they had a right to deal justice.	no, we have free will, the entire family did not die because of the gangsters actions, yes the mother and infant died due to the extreme tragedy, but the father didnt have to commit suicide	2
That is my point. I want people to leave it as a possibility. Let people believe what they want. Do you get what I am saying? I wouldn't care if Gid didn't. I just want to be able to do as I please.

If changes to materials are made without consideration to how they're being used in classroom teaching, the very purpose of changing the materials would be defeated. The purpose of making changes to materials is to adapt the it to the learner's interest, ability, and at times, to the limitations of the classroom. Ultimately, it is to provide students with the appropriate material that could bring forth maximum productivity. Without considering the usage of the materials in the classroom, any changes made to the materials would be pointless as they would not cater to the needs of the students, and thus not lead to a better understanding and learning. Therefore, i concur that changes made to materials must consider how they're used in classroom teaching. A misapplication or suitability could not only hinder students' learning but also possibly confuse them further.	So, which aspect of classroom teaching do you think must be taken into consideration? Use of a particular strategy (eg DRTA etc), use of group work etc?	2

Well, I already Hold a Design Aesthetic in mind that only requires about 27cc of U, which is apprx. 0.5Kg. The Security issue I present is more so one of Public Acceptance, which you acknowledge. I dont think that a Uranium or Plutonium Car Battery is more harmful than the Lead-Acid Battery you have in your car now. Besides, its not like it can explode. Its encased in more lead and security measures than you can imagine.	I would imagine that no uranium product would enter the public domain without employing the utmost security. The argument I gave for kilograms of uranium regarded the possibility of extracting said uranium for mischievous or malevolent purposes, and that, would be the main concern. As I understand it's illegal to possess uranium; what would it mean for a drug cartel to invest a few million into your uranium devices, and extract the contents. Furthermore, the legal, military, and ethical complications would be astronomical.	2

"Slavery was first of all not supported by God. In Leviticus 25:44-46 god says, ""Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly."" If god doesn't support slavery why did he tell people ""you may buy slaves"" and that they are ""property"" that you can pass down to your children, and that you can make them ""slaves for life"" as long as they are not Israelites? The rules he instituted for slavery only applied to Israelites. God established humane limits on an already evil and cruel system. How about instead of establishing humane limits he tells them to stop making people slaves. It's funny how god has no problem telling people silly things like don't wear mixed fabrics and don't eat shellfish but he doesn't seem to think that slavery is a very important issue. He tells people that the punishment for picking up sticks on the sabbath is death, the punishment for not being a virgin is death, the punishment for cursing at your parents is death, but there is no punishment for owning slaves or beathing your slaves as long as they survive the beating. Doesn't that strike you as a little odd? They were given a day of rest (Ex. 20:10). This wasn't for the benefit of the slave. It was because god considers work on the sabbath unholy and anyone found working on the sabbath was to be put to death. Even if it were for the benefit of the slave does it really make a difference. Is slavery somehow not so bad since they are allowed to rest one day a week? They were to encouraged to attend religious services (DT. 12:12,18;16:11). So not only were they forced into slavery but they also had to grovel to the god who said it was okay for them to be made into slaves in the first place. Why didn't these religious services include the message ""don't own slaves"" instead of ""make sure your slaves attend church with you."" Israelites slaves were to be treated with extra benevolence, being freed after 6 years (Ex. 21:2; DT. 15:12) or in the Year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:40-41). Yes, god plays favorites with the Israelites, which in itself isn't fair, but if you're not an Israelites or are female then it sucks to be you because you can be made a slave for life. Female slaves who become wives to their owners were to be given all respect as a normal wife (Ex. 21:8-11). How come you skipped verse 7? ""If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do."" Why would a benevolent god say it's okay to sell your daugthers as a slave and say that she can be made into a lifetime slave, unlike males who are set free after 6 years? So not only is god okay with slavery, he's also sexist. When a term of slavery ended the slave had to be a gift (DT. 15:13-14). Only for Israelites. All others are slaves for life. If a slave receives excessive physical abuse they are granted freedom (Ex. 21:26-27) and is considered a crime.  Only if they lose an eye or a tooth during the beating and are Hebrew.  Through these measures we see moses, by God, meant slaves were human beings and granted rights by their creator. Again, only for Israelites. Since you used Moses for your example, lets see what else he has to say about slavery. Deuteronomy 20: 10-15 ""When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby."" So not only are people forced into slavery by gods chosen people, the women are considered plunder. So in context I believe the allowed physical abuse is like that of disciplining a child and yes I day and agree this is fair. This isn't just a minor discipline like a spanking a child. It says, “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."" It doesn't say beat them gently like disciplining a child. It says as long as they survive the beating there is nothing wrong with it. It even mentions a rod and recovery time. Do you think something as minor as disciplining a child takes a day or two to recover from?  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFmC6BD1B4'>This video shows just how ridiculous the Biblical god is when it comes to slavery."	I admit I struggled with this one so I looked at an apologetic site. I came up with the same answer but without scriptural support, they gave it. Here is what I found: The laws for servants who were non-Hebrews were slightly different. For them there was no automatic release, either in the Jubilee year (Leviticus 25:44-46), or the seventh year of debt cancellation (Deuteronomy 15:3). These foreign indentured servants were outside the covenant community, and did not receive the benefit of debt cancellation. The Hebrews were permitted to pass them on as an inheritance to the next generation until their debts were repaid, which is the meaing of ‘olam’ in Leviticus 25:46 (translated ‘perpetually’). The text does not mean they were permanent possessions, but is an explanation as to why they do not go out at the seventh year of release or the Jubilee as the Hebrews do (the reason being that their debts are not cancelled). However, the Law of Moses still maintained their personal legal rights relating to physical protection (Exodus 21:20-21, 26-27), freedom of movement, and access to liberty (Deuteronomy 23:15-16). Any bondservant purchased from the Gentiles had the right to flee their master, and receive the protection of the Law of Moses if they did so: Deuteronomy 23: 15 You must not return an escaped slave to his master when he has run away to you. 16 Indeed, he may live among you in any place he chooses, in whichever of your villages he prefers; you must not oppress him. Thus even for bondservants purchased from the Gentiles, servititude was not a permanent institution. Importantly, the Law of Moses made no provision for any slave trade. It was permissible to purchase men and women who voluntarily sold themselves into indentured service, but not to sell them (Exodus 21:2, Leviticus 25:39, 42, 45, Deuteronomy 15:12). Taking men and women and enslaving them against their will, or selling them into slavery, was expressly forbidden on pain of death (Exodus 21:16, Deuteronomy 24:7). <a href='http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/slavery-in-the-bible-25/'>http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/slavery-in-the-bible-25/ 	2

Other than debate and Jiu Jitsu both being part of a large group of activities that share a common philosophy, what leads you to believe that debate is the highest form of Jiu Jitsu?	Oh, I don't know, I just thought it sounded good. :)	2
Yes, electronic cigarettes should be brought on. Ii has no damage on human, it does not have nicotine. It will help to people who is addicted to cigarette to stop.	Actually, they do have nicotine. But nicotine itself does not kill. It's all the other 1999 carcinogenesis that give people cancer. The nicotine just addicts you. But all electronic cigarettes have are nicotine and flavorful chemical solution that is 90% water.	2
Nothing at all. They just change them to private so no one else can reply.	"I saw one that was a private religious debate with the title ""I'm tired of Athiests, blah, blah, blah."", something like that. So it obviously isn't a debate. It's just a group of people with the same opinion talking about why they hate Athiests."	2
"I think Stalin just cared more about his power than anything. There was this one time where someone came into his office and he said: ""Why are you eyes looking so shifty today comrade?"" The person he was talking about was then sent to gulag for 10 years. At least the bad things Stalin was responsible for didn't last forever, and he did stop Hitler."	"To be specific, Hitler stopped Hitler. Germany could have beaten Russia, however, Stalin began to give his generals power and allow them to fight the battles strategically. Hitler ignored most of his general's advice and made terrible decisions. And when Stalin ""stopped Hitler"" what did he do? Did he liberate the oppressed areas? Did he make their lives better? Nope, it was just like exchanging one dictator for another."	2
I think you should review the definition of sarcasm.  Propaganda surely plays a role in the negative perception that persists around pot. As does Hollywood and the way they present people under the influence. Those who have never tried it may believe that the Hollywood high is the same as a real person would experience, when in truth that is rarely the case (some movies do a good job of presenting being high realistically).  I'm not arguing that stoners are too stoned to make a stand. The point is that they are just not motivated to be politically active for the cause.  I think that if there were a strong grassroots movement, change would certainly follow. There are enough people who don't smoke weed who understand it's not a big deal and the US government is fully aware of the lack of danger.	"By ""sarcasm"" I mean I'm pointing out that too often on this site we don't allow our opinions to be changed and end up head-butting our opponents.

Define the term 'just'. Describe the meaning of the phrase 'morally responsible'. If it means what I think it means, then I should imagine that most soldiers - whether the war was just or not - feel responsible for the deaths and the suffering they cause.

Your debate is invalid because you assume there are only two choices: gold based money, or Government printed currency. What are you talking about? This isn't a debate about any type of fiat money...

Christianity was wrong then, it is now, and it will continue to be dead wrong about religion. In fifty years, Christianity will be completely refuted and humanity will finally move on. you really make it too easy.	Yeaaah. It's so easy to shoot down religion. I mean, it helps that it's 100% false, but still, most lies are at least somewhat defendable. I mean, the only way to deny evolution is to brain damage yourself and believe that the world is 6000 years old. If evolution didn't happen, what did? Creationism? hahahahahahaha' It's not funny.

"Uhh..? Lul wut?  How is the answer 'yes' relevant to the question "" Why Can't We Be Friends""?  Surely either the question should be "" can we be friends"" or the answer be "" because...""

Eve was made from Adam's rib. Please, show me a human that can rip out a rib and make a woman. Other wise desperat men would have women. Go ahead. Explain. Evolution is not supported by the bible. I think I understand more about evolution that you do. I study bacteria, viruses, plagues, fungi, etc. I have to study their origin as well and they do source back to a logical origin of their birth. Eve was made from a rib. Enough said.	"I believe man and women were made divenly but the rest of creation was evolved. Man did not have enough time to make the intelligence leap needed even on the most recent and closest homo-sapien relative given by carbon dating. The Bible says the forms of life came from the water, and the land. Each cstoagory of animal came ""after his kind"". The actual or literal Hebrew to English translation us by means of or agency of succeeding species. Evolution is an evolution of a species to another, but the evolution is kept within the species. Their comes a point where the great x 20 grandfather is a different species, but the current and next generation are the same. The bible basically says evolution with a combination of life coming from the water and land and the literal translation of aftrr their kind. Also the Hebrew word for day, bara, can mean an unspecified amount of time."	2
Much better and you made me think! But have you ever experienced really strange dejavu ?	Yes I have. Dejavu is natures way of telling you that you're doing what you were destined to do. It means your life is on track. ;)	2

"You want to announce to the world that you have objectum sexuality and feel some deep personal commitment to an object, you go. If you want the rest of us to accord your relationship with that object the social or legal standing of a marriage, forget it. First off, a relationship with an object cannot fulfill the social functions of marriage. You cannot set joint goals with an object because an object has no goals. You cannot contribute mutually to building a life or future because an object has no volition. You cannot procreate because an object is not alive. You cannot care mutually for your community or extended family because not only does an object not have a family, but it just friggin' sits there. And while a person may draw a sense of emotional comfort from an object, you'd be hard pressed to argue that the object ""feels"" the same way (all theories of animism aside). It is provable, though, that the object does not ""respond"" to the person in any meaningful way. So a relationship with an object does not fulfill any of the social functions of a ""marriage."" Objects do not have the legal status of persons and it's just goofy to suggest that they should. Eija-Riitta Berliner-Mauer, who considers herself ""married"" to the Berlin Wall, describes tearing down the wall as an assault on her husband by a brutal mob. Obviously most of us do not think of tearing down a public object as an ""assault,"" because an object is not a person. Should she have had the right to insist that the wall not be torn down (and that Germany, incidentally, remain two separate nations) on the grounds that the wall is her ""husband"" and that trumps the fact that her ""husband"" is also an inanimate demarcation of an international boundary and is owned by someone else? I don't think you'll find many supporters for that position. Imagine what this might do to private property rights. Say, for example, that I ""marry"" your house. What rights over your property have I suddenly obtained by declaring myself married to it? If the answer is ""none"", and you can continue to exclude me from your property and modify your house or knock it down, or anything else you as a lawful owner of property might do, what does that do to my ""marriage""? If the answer is anything other than ""none"", what does that do to your property? Personally, I think that if you have objectum sexuality, you should consult a psychotherapist about whether or not you're having difficulty forming relationships with people. But if you want to go on being in love with an object, it's your life and that's fine too. Heck, if you want to hold a personal commitment ceremony with your coffee cup or the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Panama Canal or whatever, I say invite all your friends and have at. It's absurd to suggest that your relationship with the object be given any official status, though."	"I think the main problem with this objectum sexuality is that the objects do not get the option to say yes or no.  The woman in this story is just funny though,  ""I love him as much as women love their husbands and know we’ll be together forever,” she said.  Miss Wolfe first fell for the ride when she was 13: “I was instantly attracted to him sexually and mentally.  She now sleeps with a picture of the ride on her ceiling and carries its spare nuts and bolts around to feel closer to it.  She claims to believe they share a fulfilling physical and spiritual relationship and does not get jealous when other people ride it."" At least, if you're going to marry an object, make him/her/it be faithful!!!"	2
Athiests are obviously so much better. There's nothing in the world out there that's non-religious AND bad at the same time. It's just NOT POSSIBLE IS IT??	But the point is does religion cause violence, hatred and ignorance? Yes. Does athiesm? No. Yes there have been many killers, dictators and evil deeds commited by both athiest and religious people alike - but does religion in some cases inspire people to slaughter, hate and discriminate? Yes, ofcourse it does. Does athiesm, no. People are quick to point out cases such as Stalin, Hitler etc. when denouncing athiesm as being just as bad as religion in inspiring such things, but Stalin wasn't inspired by athiesm to be such a absolute cunt, he was inspired by ideals such as Marxism, as Hitler was inspired by his vision of a super-race. That is simplyfing things, yes, but it does get to the heart of the problem, which is that a beleif that your serving a God (the true and only God, mind you, your God) can lead to, in extreme cases, terrible atroscities being commited. Can a beleif in a Godless and random universe, combined with nothing else, inspire such things? No.	2
This reminds me of this ancient book called The Art of War by Sun Tzu. One of the primary principles proposed in it is that the only way a general can get the best out of a conflict is to avoid it. This seems in tune what you have been saying about Jiu Jitsu. Another interesting (and self-evident) points is that to be most effective, the entire army and the general must work with the intention and order of one mind. To be the best, an army needs to know what its job is, and it must work together at all times to achieve that goal. There's no room for internal conflict. Translated into debate terms this means that one ought to know why one is writing an argument. You shouldn't go into a debate without being fully aware of what you want to achieve. This relates to the Jiu Jitsu mentality of always seeking an end to violence. You never stray from that goal. Now, I might be talking over my head here, but I would assume that flexibility in strategy is an integral part of Jiu Jitsu as well. By that I mean that it is wrong to be enslaved by pre-determined strategy. The general has to make the best out of the information he has in the present; if his initial strategy was to make a series of six complicated moves, then he shouldn't stick to that plan if he could see that he could end the conflict in two. This is thickly emphasized in The Art of War. Related to debates, this means that you shouldn't plan two or three or four pairs of answers ahead and blindly stick to that idea, if you can see that things aren't going as anticipated. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't plan ahead, it just means that you mustn't stick to your plan when the present scenario contradicts what you had hoped for.  One of the things I like the best about The Art of War is that it teaches a general that he must give his opponent a noble exit. If the general can't 'take whole' the enemy (i.e. disarm, make the enemy surrender, or exterminate without losing any of the general's men (like 3 men surrounded by a hundred)), then the enemy should be able to back off. Directly related to this is that the enemy mustn't be cornered or they will fight with desperation like people who has got nothing to lose. I have seen that roughly the same holds for debating. Unless you have irrefutably arguments (both in a rational and rhetorical sense), then it simply won't work not to leave things open-ended. Unless no one can disagree with you, you shouldn't insist that someone is invariably wrong. You must always give your opponent the opportunity to back off, even when that involves your opponent taking a cheap shot at you.  Jiu Jitsu seems like a fascinating art. I have practiced Aikido a small bit, but I lost interest because the time frames for getting good at it (Sensei used to say that true masters will call aikidōkas beginners, even if said beginners has practiced for twenty years). Do you know if Jiu Jitsu is just as hard to get good at?	"This reminds me of this ancient book called The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Many gems wait to be mined from this book :) One of the primary principles proposed in it is that the only way a general can get the best out of a conflict is to avoid it. This seems in tune what you have been saying about Jiu Jitsu. Actually The philosophy of Jiu-Jitsu isn't really about avoiding conflict, but engaging in conflict in as honorable a manner as our skills allow. Many, if not most mammals, tumble around and play in a feisty but gentle manner with each other. I have a small kitten and a puppy who are awesome Jiu Jitsu training partners. Avoiding conflict is by no means always the wisest option. Much of the beauty of Jiu Jitsu is the ability to overcome brutality with artful and gentle technique, and where you can, you should. We JJ folk get excited at the prospect of getting into conflicts where we can showcase our arts beauty and effectiveness. This relates to the Jiu Jitsu mentality of always seeking an end to violence. You never stray from that goal.  it is wrong to be enslaved by pre-determined strategy. Violence cannot be part of the strategy. The general has to make the best out of the information he has in the present; if his initial strategy was to make a series of six complicated moves, then he shouldn't stick to that plan if he could see that he could end the conflict in two.

It doesn't mean that you shouldn't plan ahead, it just means that you mustn't stick to your plan when the present scenario contradicts what you had hoped for.  A serious thing to realize is that many of the most important lessons we learn are through extended conflicts. Conflicts are definitely not something we should attempt to do away with because they are a key means of growth and development. However we would be wise to quickly bring an end to violence in conflict. The spirited contest is a fountain of truth, that is poisoned by violence. With violence out of the picture, conflict is to be savored. One of the things I like the best about The Art of War is that it teaches a general that he must give his opponent a noble exit. If the general can't 'take whole' the enemy (i.e. disarm, make the enemy surrender, or exterminate without losing any of the general's men (like 3 men surrounded by a hundred)), then the enemy should be able to back off.

Unless no one can disagree with you, you shouldn't insist that someone is invariably wrong. You must always give your opponent the opportunity to back off, even when that involves your opponent taking a cheap shot at you. This is interesting as it applies to training in JJ. There are some interesting dynamics at play in the training match. In my classes I start students in specific advantageous/disadvantageous positions (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_mount'>such as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_control'>and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(grappling'>and)) and instruct them to do their best to either escape or maintain these starting positions. It's much harder work to escape the disadvantaged position than to maintain the advantaged position and I find that training is more effective the less you are -allowed- to succeed and the more your opponent makes you earn it. Strangely enough, this means that they are better off training with someone closer to their own skill level than directly with me because they would get extremely discouraged trying to improve position. There's been many times that beginners ""fight with desperation"" trying to escape these positions, and I simply love being involved in training desperation out of people. In fact, I must admit, this brings to light how training Jiu-Jitsu on the mat is superior in a sense to the ""verbal Jiu-Jitsu"" of a debate. On the mat, poor technique is almost never effective. :) Do you know if Jiu Jitsu is just as hard to get good at? People who make their living teaching Jiu-Jitsu (And Aikido as well) have a vested interest in slow advancement of rank. However, I can tell you that it is possible to become proficient in Jiu-Jitsu in a relatively short period of time. I'd estimate about 6 months to a year if you aren't in bad shape, and you have access to good training partners. If you are seriously interested in taking a class, I can give you advice on how to get the most for your money, as prices are generally kind of steep. My unfettered opinion is that Jiu-Jitsu (And I heavily favor the Brazillian variety) is what Aikido pretends to be. Please do tell me if you decide to try it, as I'd like to dump some information on you before you sign up."	2
I'm sorry to say but yearly temperature fluctuations in your state are hardly relevant to rising mean global temperatures.

I don't think there is anything wrong with it. My best moments are with my friends partying, I don't want to trade them for anything. I don't know what you mean by ''young age''. I am 18, is that ''at a young age'' ? If so, then I think it is up to her. If at a young age is 12, then no. I don't want her to party at a young age.	Shouldn't your best moments be spent with your child?!?! When I say young age I mean before college.	2
If you down-vote something and don't dispute it, that comes across as pretty weak. There are some particularly bad posts that really do deserve to be voted down, but as a courtesy you should at least tell the person why you did it. When I get down-voted but my post goes undisputed, I usually assume someone disliked or didn't agree with that I said, but doesn't have adequate brainpower or will to refute it.	Yeah, I agree. I actually feel kinda annoyed when people do that. Not because I lose a point, I don't care about the points. I'm not here to get points. But I get annoyed because I'm really interested in hearing their opinion, and why they don't agree with me. I think a comment should be voted down when it is amusing to someone, or just are idiotic.. racist and so on. You know what I mean right?	2
Dang. I wanted a serious debate and its gone. WHO CARES?!??!!!? I just want the points.	lol, well here's another for you.	2
If English means anything, then it really means nothing. The whole point of a language is to convey ideas. If you can interpret someone's words any way you want, then it's safe to say their original idea was not conveyed at all and the whole point of their paper/speech/artwork was lost.	"""If English means anything, then it really means nothing."" ....Whhat!? ..If you want to say something, freaking say it.  You should think about being an english teacher."	2
What experiences? I should love a lesson in the history of the great Akulakhan.	Nothing I'd like to discuss.

Let's just say it prevents me from revoking the entire world of the paranormal and religion.	2
Students should complete studying because university or college certificate can give the person more opportunity of career so they will have a better future .	Yes, this is true, although students will have more experience to about their future after graduation.	2

I have many flags and I find them to be very interesting. People tell me this all the time. Since I made this video, I got the flag of SFR Yugoslavia, Poland, and Macedonia.	Good idea, never thought of it. In fact I shall start ze collection of ze flags!	2
This kind of problems are most famous amongst us! It is like this: When we concentrate on environment, We forget terrorists and then they attack us! When we concentrate on terrorists, we are perturbed by this pollutions and others!	You are very right in saying this one! After all, in our fight, We are killing the nature! We can live without anything but nature! HAIL NATURE!	2
I say yes in the events of terrorists threatening our country, or if someone kidnapped or did something to my kids or family members, I would torture them myself if I could get to them.	I have to agree with you... Don't mess with my family !	2
That is why I won't touch Fate/Stay Night. Black Lagoon is good, if you like female characters that are not helpless, mafia wars and a lot of guns.	Oh, I'm more into the sci-fi fantasies, but female characters who are not helpless are cool.	2
YES, Joe, it is you are getting the guy while we are all alone. <a href='http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/674041/674041,1292506674,1/stock-photo-the-envy-of-girl-to-friends-happiness-the-envious-girl-is-looking-to-friends-on-white-background-67315300.jpg'>Girl	I was thinking maybe people should get a share of all the points generated by their debates. My joke debates don't generate much discussion. ;)	2
I don't like liberals, but I find it fun to watch them as they screw up the country.	I don't like liberals, but I find it fun to watch them as they screw up the country. You are free to remove yourself from our internet.	2
Stalin was particularly rough on the Ukraine, he killed about a quarter of its population, but Hitler regime killed half its population.	Actually, they both killed about 25% during the war. Then when you add in the gulags, famines and purges from the USSR, Stalin (and Lenin for that matter as well) did far more damage to the Ukraine. Also, I'm not just making this up, my family has some roots in the Ukraine and some of my relatives were there during WWI and WWII, the Russians were worse.	2
"It does need to be discussed at home, but just because something needs to happen, it does not necessarily means it will. How many households in Brazil have supportive parents willing to hold this kind of difficult conversation with their children? Not many, that is for sure. It is also the school's duty to educate - not to take over the parent's hole, but to aid them. And why would the fact the Government would need to spend money with this kind of important tool to educate our children be an argument against sex education classes? It is not a waste of money, it is money used on what it should be used. And I see no connection between the exposition of the students' sex life and sex education classes. In fact, if nothing, sex education classes are supposed to make children more comfortable with the subject. And I completely disagree with the last point made. As said by Joyce and Daniella, children are exposed to sex all the time, be it in magazines or outdoors. I can assure you that sex education classes will not introduce them to what sex is. These classes are, on the contrary, supposed to educate and prevent against any kind of ill behavior related to sex children might have. They are already exposed to it, might as well educate them.  In order to discuss this issue, it is important to know what is in fact taught in sex education classes. Putting ""sex"" and ""children"" in the same sentence does not need to necessarily mean something bad at all times."	One thing is true, the psycological aspect of sex education classes would not only help diminish the prejudice but also the misconceptions about specific matters in this kind of relationship. Dealing with questions like sexuality would help students accept themselves and each other in a healthy way; developing a view on emotions and feelings would provide certain maturity for the growing affective life; these lessons would also be an accessible help for those who suffer with sexual abuse, since victims usualy don't seek for help, due to insecurity, a professional would easily be able to find traces of aggression and for this reason give the apropriate assistance. Nevertheless, the fact that sex education classes would make children more comfortable with the subject, would probably push them to experiment having sexual relations earlier, because of the familiarity with the theme which is bigger when you learn and talk about a subject then when you are sometimes exposed to it, a point that should be defined is: at what age it should be considered natural the exposition of such a theme, since there has to exist, in some level, maturity enough to understand consequences of their actions, after all pregnancy possible and it is a matter of responsability.	2
and youre a piece of freaking salmon fodder!!! so what?	Good dolphin! :D	2
Should we abandon all endeavors in which we originally fail?	In this case, yes. Our educational system has enough problems as it is and we can't afford it... and it's not necessary.	2
So you don't like it when someone wishes you Happy Holidays? What does it really matter?	I don't mind if they do... it actually makes sense, especially if they're taking part in a different holiday around that time, but this isn't about people putting a religious label on a celebration... it's about people trying to take away a religious term out of a religious holiday, yet still celebrating it the same way (minus going to church and so on). I guess what I'm trying to say is that after you decorate your Christmas tree and put up your Christmas lights while listening to Christmas music, it seems kind of unnecessary to ditch the term when referring to the actual event.	2
I mean - there must be something powerful that made us right? Why? Lets examine what we know. We know that we exist. We know (or we will assume, as we both agree on this) that all we know, space, time, and all the matter that we can observe, came into existence from the Big Bang a few billion years ago. That does not require that a higher power created the singularity that came before. It certainly does not require that a sentient higher power (God) created the singularity. Essentially, we just don't know. We just know it's nothing ordinary: that does not mean exceptionally powerful. Also, how you use the word is somewhat relative. In an existence of many more dimensions than we know, no time or space or matter as we now know it, anything would be seen as 'powerful' to us. That does not require that something is a higher power. Because human have NEVER succeed in trying to create life - and by that I mean a living creature with a consciousness. Didn't we do that with Dolly, in 1996? Cloning is quite a common procedure nowadays, it was recently in the news that the Olympics will accept cloned horses into events (and it's likely that there will be cloned horses in 2016. Cloning humans could definitely be done if it were allowed (they may not be healthy, but they would be undeniably human).	Why? Lets examine what we know. We know that we exist.

I really don't understand the process of a clone - and can't really tell you if I think that, the one or the ones who created Dolly, created life. I doubt this - but I am not so clever in the subject, so I'm not gonna state anything :p	2
please ban me too Enlightened...	lol this guy is a host abuser and probably will never get participants in any of his other debates.	2
How would they know if it is merely hearsay? No evidence at all.	The fact that someone reported you for it is pretty strong evidence. Either it's true or the person who falsely accused you is psychotic. It would be pretty obvious who was lying.	2
I'm not sure what you mean, but usually, when I see the shadow of something over head, I jump backwards and crash into somebody. Once I pick my head up, whatever was flying overhead is usually gone.	Check the other side over <---- there and you'll see what we mean. Then switch sides ;)	2

1. Good things. 2. Comedians on television... also in recently years, television commercials. Or, well... the prank plastic tongue?

Whatever floats our boat of prosperity.	A plastic tongue can add to our prosperity? ;)	2

If all the folklore was assumed correctly about vampires, humans would adapt in never going outside after dark, carry crosses and garlic at all times, never allow total strangers into their homes, and install ultraviolet lights in everything.

I don't know why so can't explain it but I have a problem giving an apology to anyone whether right or wrong. I eventually do it	You should never have to apologize for being right. You may apologize for the way you may have made the person feel and maybe even explain your position, but apologizing for being right makes no sense to me.	2
Yes! The site should be more media friendly... I've asked Andy about this many times but he never replied back to me? ;(	Ok folks, where do you want the pics to post? If you are speaking of a debate, there is no issue. If you are speaking an argument posted to a debate, I haven't looked at it yet as I have had other priorities for the site... Which one are you speaking of? Thanks, Andy	2
I hope you're not going to have Killerbee beat me up? ?	Shit just got real.	2
I'm sick and tired of all of these special interest groups trying to extract special privileges for their group. If God wanted us all to be equal, he would have made us equal. That picture just goes to show the problems that arise when you try to give special benefits to a group of people. :)	Joe, I went to an all boys high school for 4 straight years... you don't understand how amazing that picture was! I think we couldn't even go a day without a racist, sexist, or mom joke. LOL	2
Well since their are no completely harmless drugs completely harmless ones should be legal.	They are actually experimenting a new drug that is completely harmless, yet still gives you a good time. But your point is very valid lol.	2

Lol. touche.  	Thank you. ;)	2
"Yes. Though, we'll never know will we? There's always the chance a very charismatic person could convince an idiotic government official that homophobia, womens rights, or anything else is potentially threatening a so-called ""perfect"" society. I do believe that we should try to stop that before it can get very far, but of course, the United States does not ike to interfere untill too late."	"I think that one of these days there will be a person that will try to be the ""homophobic hitler"" There are millions of homophobes and most of them will stop at nothing to get rid of homosexuals. I just think that, now, they probably wouldn't get very far because theres so many homosexuals nowadays and they aren't afraid of a little fight between right and wrong."	2
That is basically what I said about managing.	No it isn't. It is 20 times harder to manage your money when you have 1/20 the amount of money to live off of. I described situations where the people can't help it because of outside influences.	2
That's a relief.	I totally thought it could be true, until I saw that it was just a map of America. I have no faith that we can find stuff on a map. :(	2
No don't use nuclear power because when the us got it others got it and it became a big mess bigger than we wanted look where we are with north korea right now	It's nuclear power, not nuclear weapons like North Korea.	2
"No it's preparing for the day that you might go bankrupt and then can beg them for assistance, increasing the probability of them feeling guilty for not helping you by saying ""Hey I helped you when you were poor""."	There we go! In preparation of yourself potentially becoming impoverished is a non moral reason to help fight poverty. In other words to lay a safety net in case you fall.	2
And now another down vote? Who are you anonymous cowards?	It's Gummybear22... she's psycho crazy about The Hunger Games and thinks the character Finnick is a real person.	2
I think you'll find it's exactly the thing an evolved species would do. Having the intelligence that we do, along with our over sized adrenal glands, inevitably leads to conflict. Look at any other species on the planet, and you'll see identical behaviour. And stop using evolution for ethics.	Basically the point I was going to make, I would add though that those that think we are some sort of evolutionary pinnacle are greatly deluded, and lack a serious understanding of what evolution or more natural selection does.  Also, have an upvote.	2
Yep, too many consumers brainwashed by the producers of mass-media.	ugh true! and what's worse is that allot of people refuse to believe the fact that terrorist as a word, does not mean muslim....oh god~	2
"""We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equally."" Sorry Srom, but God didn't write the Decleration of Independence..."

"I think that W.O.W. for Xbox 360 will be like, Wow! ;) BTW, we don't call it ""sucks balls"" we call it ""Tea Bagging"" ;)"	lol joe you tool..... i shall tea bag you!!!! duncer runs up and teabags joecavalry	2
I like this kid. No offense.	The Bible is Christianity worst enemy, after all.    	2
I would like to add that the war was about slavery but only from the NORTHERN perspective. The south was fighting for independents from the union.	Well, it really depends what northern perspective you are looking at it from. For some of the North it was about slavery, for most of the North it was about preserving the union. For Lincoln it was mainly about the union.	2
Ron Paul isn't a reliable authority, the figure sounds absurd, and by definition killing people isn't terrorism but flying planes into innocent civilians is. Besides, we all know that the life exchange rate for Iraq is 10000 Iraqis for 1 American.	The IBC (Iraq Body Count) actually estimates closer to 100,000 (http://www.iraqbodycount.org/) and about 19,000 of that are insurgents (http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-09-26-insurgents_N.htm).  I have no idea where Ron Paul got 1 million.	2
Story is retarded BS stolen from Gilgamesh. How in ship long 135m, wide 22m, tall 13.5m you could store seeds for 275 000 plants and more than million of different animal species.  How did they feed them?  What they lived from after the flood? No plants anymore just swamp?	no offence to christians but this is just a story,and is somewhat like a fairy tale,cows who jump over the moon and Santa Claus.	2

Your science did not create Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional herbal medicine and yoga. Millions practices it while others consider it silly. Like I said, it is only valid when you experience it. Why do monks spent so much time meditating? It is their key to longevity relying little none on vitamins and modern medicine. I dont suppose you can explain 'chi', inner energy do you? I may make this sound funny but it is to show you the limitations of scientific explanation.	"Your science did not create Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional herbal medicine and yoga. Why not? Modern science, no. But a form of the scientific method, I think yes.  How else did the person who created Tai Chi learn of it? Through trial and error of course. He figured out what worked, and what did not work, and continuously refined the practice.  Qi Gong  is a practice of aligning breath, movement, and awareness for exercise, healing, and meditation. Again, how did they learn how to align their breath, adjust their movements, and awareness without trial and error? Some form of the scientific method lead them to discover Qi Gong as well.  Traditional Herbal Medicine is the same thing. Perhaps someone was cooking some type of dish and decided to throw a certain herb into the dish, and discovered the medicinal properties of the herb and then began experimenting with different herbs from that point on.  Yoga is the same as Qi Gong and Tai Chi. Someone had to refine the technique, try new things, and learn more once they discovered the tip of the iceberg known as Yoga.  I dont suppose you can explain 'chi', inner energy do you? Care to explain what it is exactly so I can attempt to answer your question? I may make this sound funny but it is to show you the limitations of scientific explanation. None of the things you listed are outside of the ""limitations"" of scientific explanation."	2

Possibly. It depends on the disability. Usually it would hinder the evolutionary process but if the mutation ends up being beneficial for the organism then great.	And here I was thinking you were just some sweet kid. Turns out you've got a pretty solid grasp of evolutionary theory! Saya kagum!	2
No. I am not willing to be hurt again. ;'(	I meant not to express your soul to everyone, but passively look for the people who like you as you're. As usual, we know those kind of people; we just do not let them close us. We have various types of reasons for that: but the issue is our unjustifiable wishes and just it is.	2
Damn auto-correct ;)  OK, I fixed it. I think you are describing agnosticism. Atheists are dead sure there's not God ;)	To be sure that there is no god doesn't necessarily mean you believe he doesn't exist. It just means you don't believe he exists. I am trying to think of an example of this. Believing a thing. Is not the same as not believing a thing does not not exist. Is that confusing? I think it is.	2
Fiscally liberal = right-wing Being fiscally liberal means that you support greater government role and control over the economy. That is not a right wing belief. I personally don't view hating drugs as being socially conservative Being anti-drug is very large part of being socially conservative.	He was fiscally liberal meaning he wanted LITTLE CONTROL! You have a misconceived view of Hitler's economic ideology. My only aspect of social conservatism is drug use.	2
Thanks for proving my point. :D	The point that you don't know? But you've already proved that yourself...	2
I got it from some site called Answers in Genesis or something.	Sites run by fanatical christians aren't usually reliable sources of information of any kind, definitely not any statistics.	2
So Arabic Christians that call god in their own language are not Christians then?	Ignore him. Arab Christians say Allah because Allah is the only Arabic word for God.	2
It should be legalized because it only hurts the people who want it to hurt them. It doesn't physically or psychologically hurt your body. it only hurts people who think that it's a horrible drug, and are watching their loved ones use it. Marijuana doesn't hurt the user, it hurts the ignorant people around the user	"I do not support this persons ignorant argument that Marijuana hurts people! Cannabis cures cancer as proved by Harvard researchers, ""Heavy marijuana smokers are 70% less likely to get cancer"" say A scientist on Science Friday radio show. Therefore you can not say that marijuana hurts them if their loved ones smoking pot are actually living and not dying of cancer or suffering all the other 16 ailments it is as yet been found to cure."	2

I agree that music does sometimes help people concentrate it just depends on the person.	Yeah exactly, its definitely a benefit, for those who can use it for something good.	2
Nope. I would say that you exercise/eating habits or lack thereof would lead to obesity. You could sit sat the computer for 8 hours a day at work, but if you had a healthy diet and exercised you would be fine. It's parents spoiling their kids, I find, that more often lead to obesity. Technology can be misinterpreted as an indirect cause because spoiled kids often have such technology. Because they're spoiled. I will stop now before I start rambling and making wild theories.	Yeah, i agree. as computers and autamation itself could not lead to obesity.it's all about parents who indulge their children's every whim and let them sitting and playing the computer games during the all day without any physical exercises and health diet	2
What do you mean by corrupt? One who does immorality? Or one who usurps the Constitution? Or what? What I define as corruption, which is immorality and the support of immorality, falls to the Democrats.	Let's stick to usurp the constitution. Let's consider dereliction of duty as corruption. Let's consider abusing power as corruption. Let's consider not following through on your ideals as corruption.	2
No offence (and I actually mean it this time) but I'd rather not.	If you don't want to be shown how the manner in which you currently interpret the word is illogical, so be it.	2

Wtf kind of sick shit is this? Seriously do you also go around killing them yourself?	I think this is ridiculous that you get knocked down 2 points while penis boy still has his. I did the best I could and bumped you back up to zero from a -1.	2
That hits the nail on the head. .	Thanks :)	2
just for the record, I got confused by the title and immediately switched my response to false after I realized what it meant. So people aren't confused.	Uriel Sebree (1848–1922) was a career officer in the United States Navy. He entered the Naval Academy during the Civil War and served until 1910, retiring as a rear admiral. He is best remembered for his two expeditions into the Arctic and for serving as the second acting governor of American Samoa	2
I'd like to point out that this is the reason that vigorously yelling at religious people and calling them dumb and blind is about as smart an idea as running around with a metal stick hitting beehives 'for kicks.'	That may be true but where else can one obtain so many kicks?	2
very funny mithoo. :P	i know right..!! :D	2
Most Americans = apathetic airheads Marijuana Smokers = microcosm of America - (old - (old with glaucoma) + religious right) <a href='http://people-press.org/report/292/who-votes-who-doesnt-and-why'>link now these are the people who vote most of the time, from 2004 because last election was an anomaly. So yes, most pot-smokers are apathetic airheads. No more so than the general population though, it just so happens the groups most likely to either not approve of marijuana, or simply not care, are the same people far more likely to vote.	I could not agree more. I'm glad you made this point. Political activism is more or less dead. I was impressed to see the grassroots efforts for Obama, but since the election, that's dropped off entirely.  Although I would say that the pot-smoking community may be more prone to apathy than the rest. I think most are too comfortable with the current laws and too hopeless that they can bring change.	2
What happens if the person farts? Do you have to smell it ;)	Of course, the nose is supplanted into that area.---------------------------------------	2
"Well not really, I can see how people can come up with ""well God did it"" because we have no proof of knowing what happen before the big bang or what created the elements for the big bang to even happen in the first place, however just because we don't know it's not logical to say ""See it must be God because we don't know"" Now as for everything being created in 7 days, one could argue with a scientific view point in this way ""now this is pure speculation"" but one can argue that at the moment of the big bang time itself was compacted ""seeing as how space and time are intertwined"", so 7 days when space and time was no bigger then a football field time was accelerated so 7 days back then would equal 14.5 billions years now seeing as how the universe is expanding and time stretches with space itself. But we have no proof of that or if that is even possible scientifically, so in the end we have to stick to the facts that we know as if now, and now we have no proof of God as a creator, but it does not mean there might not be one."	"Day in Hebrew is ""bara"". Bara can mean an unspecified amount of time nor age. Not limited to 7, 24 hour days anymore.  I am not saying the Bible lining up with science is proof of it being correct. But many atheists and agnostics dismiss Christianity because of the fundamentalists interpretation. Also because of this they go from ""open-minded"" to close minded bigots. Make sense? I am trying to clarify other interpretations and defend them."	2
I think students should complete their high studies , because they are too young for work . However they don't know any thing about the real life behind the school fence .	Ofcource Eman student will face alot of challenges and they won't be able to face it if they didn't study in college.	2
Freedom fighters don't fear for their life and hide in caves, while forming a cult and designing a scheme to kill a ton of people. Therefore, he's a terrorist and he's a pussy.	Just to play the devil's advocate, if I were fighting the world's greatest military power, I'd be doing it from a cave too. Crazy though he may be, he's not stupid enough to attack modern militaries head-on.	2
No, it's the stock market that I'm talking about, was that what you were talking about?	"What I meant was the country as a whole, like the quality of life here, the corruption in government, etc. By saying ""Either America has always been falling, and that's why I never noticed it, or it's not."" I'm relating it the country it'self to falling off a cliff. If you are always falling off a cliff you won't know what not falling off a cliff is like because falling is natural to you, so if America has been waning in it's quality for as long as I've been alive, I wouldn't know that it was because that'd be normal to me. Yet since I don't feel that it's waning, I can only assume that it's not."	2

How is being a kid unfair. Everyone must be a kid at one point in their lives. That is just life, plus being a kid isn't that bad.	Everyone must be a kid at one point in their lives My logic agrees. However, logic can be wrong. That statement may seem true but it isn't guaranteed.	2
Damn! This is a tough choice but I will go with Indian... mainly because Indian is newer to me so I haven't been eating it as long but I still wish they'd through some beef around in there every now and then.	Theres many beef dishes, are you going to the vegetarian places?	2

Prohibiting the free exercise thereof. That means the practice of religion which Atheism is the opposite of if I'm not mistaken.	"To me ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"" sounds more like freedom from religion and ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" sounds more like freedom of religion. That's why I said it could be interpreted as both."	2
"There are definitely a ton of parallels between the two. Whether he's a ""rip-off"" of Horus or not, I don't know."	The Jesus myth derives directly from the Horus myth and there are about 10 other gods which pr-éxist Jesus with the same story..see HESUS.

Well forgive the disabled for not pandering to your needs. As for the rest of it, I did address your issues. Whether you choose to see through my eyes is another matter. I am saying, according to Christians, the rules were made by God, and they were intended to be broken. No human could ever live up to such standards as they would need to be absolutely perfect, which is impossible. Thus they are all guilty of sin, and then they go to Hell because of that. Perhaps the confusion comes from your misunderstanding of the religion itself. I won't educate you on this, but I do advise you look into it a bit more. You might learn something beneficial, who knows. And yes, I meant that last part in the nicest way possible.	I am saying, according to Christians, the rules were made by God, You also said the opposite, nice debate skills. and they were intended to be broken. No human could ever live up to such standards as they would need to be absolutely perfect, which is impossible. Not exactly relevant. Thus they are all guilty of sin, and then they go to Hell because of that. So, you actually believe that everyone goes to Hell no matter what, and you attacked me for saying this, when I didn't actually say it. You might learn something beneficial, who knows. Why the hell would I want to learn about a crazy ass religion that believes that everyone goes to Hell. I see why you left. My original argument was disputing that Satan is the one who condemns people to Hell. As far as I can tell God is the one who does this. Satan doesn't decide who goes to Hell, it is only God.	2

I'm glad to see people making allowances like you are. Anyways The Spartans and the other tribes in the area of Sicily worked to oppose the Athenian Empire but only domestically. With one exception they in the union with Sparta against the Delium League joined forces against every major non Greek invader in their history. So your half right about them not fighting as one unit until they where concord. But they would fight as 2 separate forces to oppose non natives.	Ya..no. I have no reply to that, I tip my hat to you. Upvote for you!	2

This is right-wing. To be Fiscally conservative its to rigidly force the economy to obey your ideals and views (as opposed to fiscal libertarianism). You are confusing liberal with a capital 'L' to the adjective liberal. Hitler wasn't socialist. This was Stalin.	I am not referring to the oxford dictionary of two separate words I am using a term used to describe political ideologies. In American (and European politics as well) liberal used to mean libertarian until the progressive era when the term took on a new meaning. Here is the definition of fiscal conservatism: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism  Hitler was a socialist, tI suggest you do some research before you blurt out random bits of information that you made up.	2

"If customers free willingly purchase access to private theme parks, then taxpayers shouldn't have the burden of forced purchase of parks of city, state, and national parks. The only legitimate justification for the government to interfere with the free market whenever one's actions have neighborhood effect.  Thus, if A does something which will benefit B, and B does not have to pay for it, this is a ""defect"" in the free market, and it then becomes the task of government to ""correct"" that defect by taxing B to pay A for this ""benefit."" Even most museums are either non-profit or profit."	I agree. It would lift a burden off of tax payers. This would be a great relief especially now a days. With most states' budgets in the red they are closing some of their state parks. If they were privately owned this might not happen as frequently.	2
I think the completion of the study first and then think about the work because college is very important to choose the right work and help students learn more science.	Yes Afra you are righ students Should complete their study so they can depend on them self	2
Physical abuse usually leads to emotional abuse... alright, lets say your raped, thats physical, but I can assure you, your emotions will be harmed.	Physical abuse frequently leaves emotional scars. Emotional abuse does not necessarily leave emotional!	2
Despite being an atheist, I have personally come across mostly condescending ones in my life. And even though it's the side I'm not on, self-righteous Christians don't bother me as much as condescending atheists do. Still, that's not to say we don't still need atheists to have a good debate.	I find that they sometimes ask religious people to 'open their minds', when they never do.	2
But the Obamians are NOT a protected minority group. Hell..., they are not even the minority...., wait...., are you saying the libs stole the election ;)	Not yet. That's why I said I hope he didn't get in trouble. Wrongful termination lawsuits can be filed.	2

"""Hence the reason people who believe in any god are a theists and those who don't are atheists."" ...You literally just agreed with me...? My argument is that if you don't believe in God(Noun), then you're Atheist. If you believe in Zeus, then you're Theist."	You can be an Atheist and still believe in the Olympic gods, for example. That was your argument.	2
I'm going to post over here because, like Joe, I have not be a victim of this either... But I was the victim of Cerin's downvoting whorefest a while ago. But he left the site for good (I think) :D As a side note, was it really necessary to make a huge debate about this? That's really low-class. I see your argument about how you've pointed it out and everything, but maybe it would've been best to gather a few people and get them to all tell him the same rather than publicly humiliate somebody like this. :(	Essentially that is what I did. Low class, yes, but it's not a lynching. He obviously got the message and took it like a man. Overall I think he really learned something from this, and we all learned something about his ability to grow. So boo frickin hoo.	2
Oh sorry :) But I guess its a compliment to be called a scientist when you're not right ;) Probably not by a 17 year old girl. But the reason why I did is because .. almost everyone I debated on here who are atheists are also scientist. Sorry though :) I guess I used the wrong word. Magic is not it.. Magical is a proper word. The universe is magical .. how can you not think that?! You have to be seriously depressed to not think that ;p Because seriously.. watch a documentary about the history of the universe. It's so amazingly ridiculously beautiful.	"Well, yeah, it is a compliment, I just don't want to misrepresent myself. I do think the universe is ""amazingly ridiculously beautiful"". I think life is a precious thing. I bask dumbfounded by the complex yet graceful majesty of nature and the cosmos. However, I do all of this fairly certain that there are naturalistic causes for all that I see. I have seen many incredible things happen purely by the laws of physics and chemistry, by the cause and effect cycles that permeate every single thing. If I ever saw anything that happened completely outside of the laws of the universe, perhaps then I would call it magical. But so far, I can only count natural occurrences, not supernatural. Which is fine with me, because I do quite love nature.."	2

I definitely don't think she's the world's sexiest. Didn't they crown Lindsay Lohan as the world's sexiest one year? Kunis is even way hotter than her.	not sure about lindsey being crowned at one point, if she was she never should have been lol plus i don't think they can call famous people the worlds sexiest anyway.. unless they check every woman on the planet how do they know? there could be a working woman somewhere who's way hotter than both these girls but because she's not famous she won't get a vote	2
"One thing you need to consider is yes the women is going thought the pregnancy but the guy is the one who has to put up with what is essentially a 9 month long period on steroids (not to be rude) women say ""you don't know what it's like"" oh no? I bet we have a pretty good idea."	I agree with you there. The pregnancy is hard on both sides. No one side can claim absolute responsibility, and I was not factoring his strife into the my answer on the question. Yet when I do, my answer is the same. My reason is this. He has the strife, but that is the strife of being a good husband and provider. He's staying with her when the child is born, that is both of their hard work put into the creation of that beauty. Yet if he decided to leave, which he can at any point, he would deal with that strife. Her's is physical and unavoidable. Well avoidable by one choice. So I change my overall answer only slightly. If the man is staying he should have a say. FInal say must go to her, if she wants to end it before the hard work comes, she should be allowed to, but after hard work has begun, and the cravings start setting in that she send him out to please, the child is just as much a product of his strife as it is hers.	2

I would try to help with input if I knew what he was doing! lol But I'm pretty simple to please. I'll be happy with whatever they do.	2
I think it would just be better if we could separate the debates from the drama is all, a place where we all just chill and talk to each other, can respond to each other but more tuned for drama and chit-chat than debating, while debates are only for debates. I am not saying to try to rid this site of drama, and honestly that is not going to happen, however I kinda like the drama in the sense it allows me to really get to know people, sometimes it all gets a little bit too ridiculous, and decreases the quality of the site from distracting from it's original purpose.	Understandable. I see your point .	2

I actually am told by my friends that I am a major optimist because I will only look for the good in any situation.	Enlighten me, optimist, as to where the good is in the following scenario: An enraged lesbian gorilla has broken into your house and starts violently face-sitting you and you begin to almost suffocate bar the few times when your nostrils are free to breathe. Then when you've finished licking her out and she squirts into your mouth a male gorilla comes in and rips the head of all your family by slowly plucking at it and you hear their spine snap, disc by disc until their entire neck-spine has been torn ont he inside and finally the entire head is ripped as they scream with their decapitated voice-box. Then the gorillas hump one another and pull out the nukes that they'd left outside and blow your whole city up but somehow you survive as a trapped ghost there for all eternity and beyond. P.S. You felt every bit of you blowing up beforehand.	2
No, I deleted that debate myself... I did some looking around and I think I was wrong... I don't think that JustIgnoreMe was a troll after all so it wasn't fair for me to make that accusation.  I honestly did think so at first he was but after further review I think I was wrong... I have had people from the former site I was on target me so I tend to be a little paranoid... that's my problem... as for you? I have never had a problem with you therefore I would not ban you. My banning rule here is the same as it has been on other sites... I don't ban, but I will make exceptions for trolls(fake accounts) and children... I'm not arguing with kids.	"Thanks. Hopefully part of the rule will include ""some looking around"" before banning next time, but it's a start."	2
I completely disagree with that statement. If its useless than why is there NHL teams? Why do people spend their money to go watch the games? Maybe is it because your not an active person and don't enjoy sports? That is no reason to say that hockey doesn't have an importance. It's like me saying that a catch and release lake has no importance.	The Minnesota Wild sell out nearly every game. They're nicknamed the team of 18,000. The facility fills at game time. You must be a minority who doesnt like sports, sad. And Siouxrock....GO GOPHERS!	2
It comes to a butting heads battle. She does not want a kid but has to hold it for 9 months, while he does want a kid but only gave sperm for it. That being the case whose vote do you think should carry more weight? Because in the end, they can't do a half and half thing, it has to be all or nothing. All his vote, or all her vote. I say all her vote because she is the one putting in work after the sex cells have been given.	Yes but my example is a typical couple who ate both either for or deciding not to. Those are his cells in her body making up half that baby and bringing it to life. But I am only talking about what I have been for a while now.	2
""" I think it is important that Americans voice their opinions (resonably) so that we keep other people's perspective on the matter in our minds so that one group is not under/over-Representative."" Maybe it's just the lack of reasonableness on both sides of the American atheist/theist debate that I'm picking up on. And with so many internet users being American, I feel like I'm being exposed to (and often stereotyped as a theist) by their unreasonableness. Still, good point you've raised."	America has a lot of bat-shit crazy Christians. So, naturally, we also have a lot of atheists who are used to putting up with bat-shit crazy Christians. This doesn't mean that our atheists are also bat-shit crazy, nor does it mean that their arguments are likewise impaired. I think you might be confusing a high percentage of single-brain-celled, born again, evangelical, Republican Christians in this country for a lack of intelligent religious discourse in this country altogether, and I can tell you you're dead wrong. A) because this religious insanity says nothing about the opposition to it, atheism, and b) because we have a large number of highly respected and fiercely intelligent Christian apologists in this country, so even the religious side isn't all ignoramuses.	2
Our curriculum sounded nothing like that at all. Honestly they never told us what president was great or not. We just had to know what happened. Maybe because I was in Advanced Placement but I dont think all curriculums work like that.	Show off. :P	2
Education can also be propaganda and brain-washing. So it's not ALWAYS the answer. But basic education is necessary.  Also, individualism is very important. Teach people to fend for themselves or die. Teach people not to be dependent on a higher power, and take away any encouragement of such dependency. That's another good answer.	I'm not for the individualism part. People in individualist nations tend to be less self sufficient and more dependent on higher powers than those in collectivist countries. But I do agree that education does tend to be propaganda and brainwashing. Even maths and sciences are based on euro-centric histories. History is also eurocentric, but that's obviously OK since you wouldn't want to be learning about the history of Saudi Arabia when you live in w/e country... but it's when they say that a European was the first to do this and that when he obviously wasn't. Religious studies was the one that pissed me off the most.. specially when they were 'teaching' 'Hinduism'. BUT what I'm pissed off about now is how nearly every single year we studied Christianit and Judaism like they were the only 2 religions in the fucking world. Christianity I get, but why Judaism?? We barely touched upon Islam... learnt some BS on Hinduism... Touched upon Buddhism... and scratched on Sikhism.. nothing on taoism or confunacism. Really annoying.......	2
Why don't we admit both sides are taking heat. You can't celebrate publicly, well neither can Satanists. Everyone is being discriminated against because everyone has an opinion on which side is right, and neither side wants to give an inch.	Yeah you are technically right about that I just feel Atheists are taking more heat and people like warrior think that Christians are taking more heat, but this still makes for an interesting debate.	2
Well I would be happy that they got to do what they wanted. I probably should have chosen a better area to live in because I wouldve had no guess that a gorilla would break in. So that would be my fault. If I were a ghost I could explore things and study the stars further so I guess I would just be a lucky astronomer. Also if I felt every bit of the blast I would be the only person to truly know. So when more humans evolve over millions of years I will tell them all I know and become the ruler of that planet.	I stated that you'd be a static ghost, not a mobile one. 	2
Care to elaborate??? .............................................................	Suicide can be seen as cowardly by both the one committing it and those whom it affects. If anything the fact that it's cowardly will add to the bitter taste of depression required to enter the suitable frame of mind to commit it.	2
Yes, of course, because of the effect of mass-media, it propagands that Islam is connected with terrorism, but it is not connected with each other. All terrorists who commit suiside just because of the religion, are not exactly real muslims, they believe in other course of islam, even I believ that they just pretend being muslim, in order to some people's profits. Islam never teachs people to sacrifice themeselves just because of religion, it is just delusion of people.	exactlyyyyyyy! that is so true! nd it is shameful too for them to do such thing!!!	2
"The education system will bombard them with ""evolution is fact"" so it's either your religion or atheism."	Just out of curiosity then, do you see evolution and religion as incompatible?	2

The reason Batman would win is because one: he's a badass who has managed to defeat foes who have both physical and supernatural powers.

"But like I've said before, you're going on the assumption that you know what is meant by a beneficial evolutinary trait. Evolution only works by adapting an organism to become successful within its environment. If our environment ""artificially"" maintains organisms that would otherwise have been wiped out, that just simply means that the selection pressures have changed. It's still evolution, just not as we would have expected. What is meant by an evolutionary stable system is where we reach a point of equilibriam where evolutionary changes and mutations don't cause the organism to have a better chance of survival. For an extremely crude example, whist in the wild we may expect an animal who would grow a third eye to be far more sucessful than other animals, could you also say the same for a human. Would a human with three eyes: A) Have a better chance of survival than a two eyed human, or B) Reproduce more often than a two eyed human? If not, then we have reached a point where evolutionary beneficial mutations are not causing those who have received those mutations to benefit over others. The evolutionary system is therefore stable, and it will take a change in our environment rather than a change in ourselves to cause evolution to take us down a different path. But just to reiterate, saying things such as ""People who would normally have died off are artificially maintained"" simply means that that fact is a selection process, and what you would classically have expected to be beneficial traits, such as strength and speed, are no longer beneficial within our environment. This doesn't mean we are de-evolving or that evolution has stopped though; it is simply operating in a way we were not expecting. Society is our environment."	"If one creates an artificial environment, then I don't consider the organisms living inside that environment to be ""evolving."" It's more like ""artificial evolution"" or a genetic experiment. Especially if the organism that results is unable to survive in the ""real world."" Such inviable organism is an abomination because it goes against everything that is ""natural"" and thus we shouldn't lift a finger to help it survive."	2
Very interesting. Thank you.	It's all part of the services I provide. And for my next trick....	2
Crocodilians are not dinosaurs. They are their second closest living relatives though.	I've spoken to experts in this field who have told me that according to fossil records apart from size the crocodilians we see today have hardly changed since the time of the dinosaurs but that they also share the same common ancestor with birds	2
I've had ''competitions'' with my friends, who could stay away from facebook the longest. I think I lost one time and won one time. I've never taken breaks from facebook for other reasons than that.	"I deleted everyone on my Facebook that I no longer remain in contact with and then decided ""eh, fuck it"" and deactivated my account. It's nice not feeling the need to check it anymore."	2
Reporting is not strong evidence, it is HEARSAY. No proof unless witnesses.	In elementary school, maybe. But this guy is an adult. He wouldn't make up something like that. Or, if you don't like that answer, what if the witnesses are all lying? Do you need to wear a wire? What if the tape was altered?	2
Not agreeing with you on everything does not mean that I fail to see the point. Right, failing to see the point was when you failed to see the point. I don't understand why you argue with people you agree with I guess. I mean, are you even reading these Your stuff is unreadable. You spent an entire paragraph discussing something that was summed up in the first and last sentence. hat seems like a good way to miss the point fairly frequently, as well as a way to take any given debate off on some ridiculous tangent- not that I'm at all innocent of that, mind you. I'd say you miss points at least as often as I do. That's because you bury your point in a mountain of text. And you're right, I probably went on about it longer than I needed to, and I probably could have summed it up in one or two lines- certainly not JUST the last line as written, though, as it doesn't properly represent my position on the subject. See? Unreadable.	Circular reasoning is circular! One can agree with someone generally but not agree with them entirely, and I often find myself curious as to the reasoning behind a point that I agree with and question that. Details matter. The thought process matters. Debate isn't just about one side or the other winning, it's also about learning for all of those involved. As to my text being unreadable- it's wordy, but far from unreadable, and I've had numerous discussions with those who didn't seem to have any difficulty following what I'm writing. I'm not certain if it's your reading comprehension that is lacking, or if you just can't be bothered to read that much, but it's immaterial; neither case constitutes a problem on my part, and both cases are marks against you within the context of a debate forum.	2
I think this video would be good for spamming and scarring... But it makes me so uncomfortable for some reason.	Why I really don't see what the big deal is about this video maybe it is just because I have a lot of His movies and seeing His face so much it until it doesn't have any impact on me whatsoever.	2
If it ends the misery of another human being than arguably it is more moral in my opinion. Though we should have consent, otherwise we have opportunity to abuse that.	But the problem is that people may not always be able to give their consent. People in comas for example or in excruciating pain. What if you're screaming so loud you can't even hear yourself think? What if you got your tongue cut out? I think it is an extremely hard decision to know when the right time to pull the trigger is, but an essential one to make.	2
"I'm not even going to ask who or what a ""flying spaghetti monster"" is."	It was actually invented to mock religion or at least mostly used for such.	2
Assuming it actually God who was telling me to do so, then yes I would, though I don't think He would.	Assuming it actually God who was telling me to do so, then yes I would, though I don't think He would. How would you determine whether or not it was actually God telling you to kill yourself? How does any nut job (such as Abraham) determine whether or not it's actually God telling him or her to do or not do anything?	2
When I was in School we had kick ass meals, the reason is I went to a tech school and the kids learning to becomes chiefs cooked us gourmet foods like steak even sea food, we just had to pay a bit extra for higher priced food but only like $2 bucks, I loved my high school lunches : )	We had a awesome culinary arts program too, but students were not allowed to get food from them. It was a teachers only thing. They even had hospitality students to wait on them.	2
I agree that you can't have creativity without intelligence. I would say you also can't have intelligence without creativity.  Intelligence:  a (1) : the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations : reason; also : the skilled use of reason  (2) : the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (as tests)	You can pass the test without any need for originality. Term papers are written with facts, not fancy words.	2
Xbox 360 is better. It has a much better online community than PS3 does. It also has developed Kinect, an excellent motion sensing addition that allows you to play games similar to the Nintendo Wii.

If you're dying to play online, you might want to hold off--the PS3 will have ... but has significantly more functionality, chiefly in its motion-sensor abilities.	2

Is it actually locked or can you fit a screwdriver in it and pop it open... actually, now that I think about it... is it on a ground floor?	It is in the basement. The lock is an odd one. We tried to pick it but it wont budge. I havent seen one like this before.	2
I agree with you ...........................................................but......................I  also agree with Pyg...........................:)	I guess it depends on the level of maturity in the case of words and it depends on the age in the case of broken bones. For example:  A child is not very mature and so certain words may hurt him but the same words would not hurt a mature adult. Broken bones are more serious for an elderly person but not so much for a child. Now, are you going to agree with me too ;)	2
iamdavidh, Been here for a year and call others lame. Lame is clearly the words of loser. Your opinion is just that and nobody really cares about it. To know it most be such a burden.

They are born to be in wild not in human created jails. may be zoos take care of them. but they cant take care as the nature does .	It is true that they are exposed to the danger of the outside when they are in the wild, however the wild id their natural habitat. These animals are not meant to be caged in side zoos for show just to satisfy human curiosity let alone be force to learn 'trick' for human entertainment. It is just not fair for the animal to be separated away from their homes. Instead people should preserve animals natural habitat to ensure their safety. In addition they can also observe the behaviours of animals in their natural habitat.	2
It would also be immensely useful if schools would teach students the difference between porn and real-life sex (e.g. don't switch between ahem orifices without giving your instrument a rinse first, the Kama Sutra is only suitable for professional acrobats, most guys can't really last the whole night, etc...) It might reduce unwanted pregnancy, STDs, injuries from dangerous sex practices, and feelings of sexual inadequacy/dissatisfaction. And it'll leave moral guardians with less anti-porn ammunition.	The Kamasutra clearly illustrates a man with a strap on. Then again, that is a lot of girls. ... More on topic, I think it would be useful, but despite all the good stated by Peekaboo, the paladins do not really care about welfare. The care about offence and not being offended. This idea is to offensive so for whatever reason it must be wrong.	2

The vast majority of cops are good people who honestly just want to help their community and improve the lives of their neighbors. The problem is the job comes with power power attracts sociopaths and despite intense screening some always manage to slip through the cracks. and then they go out abuse their power because they can't handle it and make all cops look bad because civilians only see uniforms.	The cops that helped me when I was raped are angels. <3	2

"Ave, I think you misunderstand me. I agree with you, the supernatural is unreasonable. All of religion is unreasonable.  The supernatural is unreasonable because it is defying logic, physics, and reason. Therfore any religion is then automatically unreasonable. I agree.   And why do you say ""OUR unjustified lucky guess about the existence of the supernatural""? The guess I was referring to was the guess theists make. They could be right as likely as people who think unicorns are real, could be right, but either way in the end it was all a guess.  And you then you attempted to give the supernatural a scientific hypothesis as to what it might be. But the supernatural by definition defies physics, science, logic, ect. It's not a matter of us not being advanced enough to detect/test it, it's that it's literally opposite of how everything works and is therefore pretty much 100% false. I was giving an example of what a reasonable religion could look like.   A reasonable religon isn't possible. It's dependent upon supernatural entities/forces which cannot coexist with what we know about the universe. I agree. The only thing we might disagree on which was the main point of my post was that if a religion could prove itself scientifically somehow (which I highly doubt), then THAT would be a reasonable religion at least as far as in it being a rational thing to acknowledge as true. Religion and spirituality is BS. you remember me don't you, I'm one of the biggest atheists on here."	Ave, I think you misunderstand me. I agree with you, the supernatural is unreasonable. All of religion is unreasonable. Ok I agree. Ok The guess I was referring to was the guess theists make. They could be right as likely as people who think unicorns are real, could be right, but either way in the end it was all a guess. Then specify that is all. Dont make it seem like humanity as a whole make that guess. I was giving an example of what a reasonable religion could look like. But the problem is, as soon as you explain the supernatural scientifically it ceases to be supernatural and thus becomes natural. This would then make the religion containing it no longer a religion. I agree. The only thing we might disagree on which was the main point of my post was that if a religion could prove itself scientifically somehow (which I highly doubt), then THAT would be a reasonable religion at least as far as in it being a rational thing to acknowledge as true. Religion and spirituality is BS. you remember me don't you, I'm one of the biggest atheists on here. Okay but again once it becomes explained by science it wouldnt be a religion anymore but an accepted scientific theory. A reasonable religion literally cannot exist.	2

"Is there a universally accepted standard which isn't completely arbitrary by which we can define an act as ethical? No. So it logically follows that there is also no universally accepted standard by which we can define an act as unethical either. Therefore, eugenics is neither ethical nor unethical, it is in a state of ethical uncertainty, just like every moral act that is taken. Personally I don't see the point in coercing or forcing people into eugenics, seeing as the science behind it is shaky, to say the least. However if two people willingly want to have a child purely for the purposes of having a ""designer baby"", then they're welcome to."	"""Is there a universally accepted standard which isn't completely arbitrary by which we can define an act as ethical?"" No there isn't, hence why we're debating on the matter. People have different guidelines for ethics, like Christians use the Bible or judge ethics by using their conscience."	2
I think expulsion is a bit harsh, its not as if he brough a real gun to school but I guess it all depends on the school's rules on what's allowed into school	I do not think expulsion is the appropriate course of action, but punishment is necessary. Guns, whether fake or not, are not allowed in schools as far as I know.  The big problem here though is that he pretended as if it were a real weapon, there are laws against this.  According to <a href='http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/menacing/'>Menacing.com :  Menacing is a crime governed by state laws, which vary by state, but typically involves displaying a weapon or a course of conduct that intentionally places another person in reasonable fear of physical injury or death. As you can see, the person at the school used the gun in a way that would place another person in reasonable fear of physical injury or death. He committed an actual crime, so he is fortunate charges were not filed.	2
To act the same way and look the same way are two different things. Which of these are you suggesting would be the solution for racism? I'm just asking - of course making everyone look the same would be a solution. But personally I don't think it's a proper one. I think that is like sweeping the dust under the carpet.	I think act the same is my solution. What's the proper solution?	2

"Humans have many senses beyond the basic or most obvious five senses. The sense of balance is referred to as ""equilibrioception"" and includes both angular momentum acceleration and linear acceleration (i.e. balance and acceleration). ""Thermoception"" is the sense of heat and its absence by the skin. ""Proprioception"" provides brain with information on the relative positions of the parts of the body. ""Nociception"" or the sense of pain alerts the brain to nerve and tissue damage. ""Chronoception"" refers to the perception and experience of time passing. Add to this, there are a number of internal senses which we are unconscious of (e.g.l chemoreceptors in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of suffocation if carbon dioxide levels get too high)."	What if you can feel your body's position in a dream? Would that be InProprioception!? What if you feel your body in a dream but it's disturbing to people around you? Would that be InaPropiateoception? What if you can feel your body, in a dream, and people are disturbed by it, and it's preventing babies? Would that be InaPropriateContraoception? What if you can feel your body, in a dream, people are disturbed by it, it prevents babies, and it's exported into a country illegally? Would that be InaPropriateContraoceptionBand?

"There are two issues I see with a ""junk food"" tax. Number one, bad food is not unhealthy in moderation. If someone runs a marathon, then eats a bunch of cheesecake, that's fine for them, and they don't need to be punished. Many people are perfectly healthy by balancing bad food with exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general. Number two, it is very difficult to determine what is junk food and what is not objectively. Sure, we can all say ""oh, well obviously McDonald's is bad"", but creating a USDA regulation off of this is quite difficult, and encourages cheating to evade an extra tax."	"This is in addition to your second comment.  The USDA is also a very ineffective institution, along with the FDA , if you look at the last 50 years of their history they've teamed up with the heavy hitters that are actually creating a lot of the ""unhealthy"" choices masked as healthy.  Taxes will not solve the problem. People need to make healthy lifestyle changes themselves. Education is one key element. Preventative health is the most effective means to eliminating and or preventing future disease and health problems."	2

You also oftentimes try to find middle ground, or compromise, or mediate, so words like ""that we can all live by"" in your debates give it away.

My apologies, i thought this was centered around America. My main question then is this: What would an army do? Imagine a million or so soldiers just sitting around. What would they do? Wouldn't it be a waste to have them sitting around? They wouldn't really benefit society in times of peace. That is why an army reserve/militia is the way to go. Unless you plan on flexing your military muscles in other countries, there is no need for a standing army. A good example to look at is Switzerland.	My apologies, i thought this was centered around America.  It isn't a big deal. I just want some points. What would an army do? Imagine a million or so soldiers just sitting around. What would they do? Wouldn't it be a waste to have them sitting around? They wouldn't really benefit society in times of peace. They would probably be much more well trained and would be able to have a permanent career since thats what a standing army does.  A good example to look at is Switzerland. Many, and I mean many, countries have a standing army. The are well trained and better suited for any situation they may encounter.	2
Not at all! Reading expands your vocabulary and intelligence!	I support this completely, but I think if people were to argue on the other side, they would be thinking about false literature poisoning peoples' minds.	2
if a population wants equal rights that population does not deserve special treatment. hate crimes legislation is an old legislation that needs to be put to rest, there is a new generation coming up, people are no longer seen by color in the vast majority of the population, excluding small groups usually associated with the south... therefore, i say no more hate crime legislation, let those that seek equality truly have it, in rights and in punishment.	Well said! I agree !	2
"Things like racism and patriotism hold humanity from from being more then mere territorial animals. If we want to progress in evolution beyond the common beast, we have to, over time, become less hateful and competitive and be more cooperative. There will always be enough resources in the universe for all life to share. War and murder and competition solves nothing unless you are a beast. I can see where you get the idea that patriotism and racism can be a good thing for warriors during war... but frankly, war is pointless, idiotic, and barbaric. Innocent people are killed and raped. What is the point? Genuine human evil does exist... but killing more innocent people to stop it does not accomplish anything. And even if war is somehow necessary in the eyes of the genuinely good, something, at the very least, needs to be done in all world culture that will, over time, eventually stop people from becoming evil in the first place. ""Is doesn't matter what you think or do or believe; as soon as you enter a battle, you will always be in the wrong."" - Quote by, Kyoraku Shunsui. Perhaps... it is a fairy tale to believe that humanity will one day be free of malice and vice and selfishness... but I do not believe that evolution has a limit that will stop it from happening one day... one day that is an incalculably long time away from today."	racism is so bad wat kind qustion is that is rasicm good with patriotism think di ditty	2
Well.... you don't see me running around fighting for gay rights... I'm pretty apathetic on most social issues but:  Those people disgust me That's a pretty hateful statement to make. I hope if you have a gay child some day, you don't tell them that they disgust you. EDIT: to add... who cares about the up/down votes?	The reason why I said those people disgust me is the people who wanted to learn about the history of it.  Even if I did have a gay child I wouldn't accept their lifestyle and I would constantly pray for them to see that they made a mistake.	2
Too bad they already do. 	Your mom doesn't count :D	2
I'm inclined to believe so. They want the citizenry to believe they're uber-concerned about deficit spending, but the issue with them is always how they can play on your emotions to justify tax increases.	Basically, all the games that politicans play is an empty box given to the citizenry in all attempts to exproriate property from private individuals to them.	2

He was fiscally liberal meaning he wanted LITTLE CONTROL! You have a misconceived view of Hitler's economic ideology. My only aspect of social conservatism is drug use.	"1.

I agree with her, the idea of attaining 'true love' drives some people crazy and when they do think they finally attained it they are really attached to that person.

Not with the actual person.	2

If women are so worthless then why not just get rid of them all? Because if you did there would be no humanity for much longer? Two sausages, or however many, cannot continue our species. Considering that women give birth and God essentially gave birth to our universe then... should be obvious which one. Or was our creator just like us, simply a lot more advanced species, and in another level of existence? And had the knowledge and tools to make all this happen?	Two sausages, or however many, cannot continue our species. True, but they can make it go on for longer than two tacos!

"I find it interesting that the only people who try to deny evolution are fundamentalists. It's never any real scientist with credibility. It's often people like Hovind with a degree from a Christian degree-mill college who advocate it. To be honest, I don't even see the point of denying it. Seriously, what does it gain you? Are you seriously comfortable believing in... creationism? I mean, it just seems so incredibly stupid. It's like, there's no point to it. You can still hate gay people and and believe in your god and stuff. I mean, really, it's just so dumb I find it difficult to even think about. 6000 year old universe? That's so dumb and illogical. - ""Creationism is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. I might just puke."" That's a famous quote from a famous scientist endorsing my view."	"""You can still hate gay people and and believe in your god and stuff."" Christians don't hate gay people..... Just clearing that up!"	2
My belief is that if we keep changing taxes, we will always have problems. It's like a car, one month I put in 4 quarts of oil. Next month 5, next month 3. Who would expect that to work? The question shouldn't be what percentage of wealth is owned by the highest tax payers, but what percentage of the wealth is produced by them.  He said taxes are high, look they pay 52%. If they are making all of the money, you would expect a lot more than half the taxes. I think you may have been asking the same question I was trying to ask. I am not saying that if a guy made a million dollars last year he should still pay taxes this year just because he has more than everybody. I was strictly talking about how much they make in the year. Taxes provide dis-incentives. Income taxes provide a dis-incentive to produce. What are you talking about? Every time I see my paycheck I am thrilled to see how much Uncle Sam got ;) /endsarcasm	My belief is that if we keep changing taxes, we will always have problems This is an important point. With no way to plan what taxes are going to be over the long run, it is difficult to account for future costs, and no way to be sure what or how to invest. Confidence is key, we have none.	2
Because I know right at the point where I'm going to die, I can take it off..! Besides, blistering heat may be bad, but I can stand it.

Then you're quite screwed, am I right?	2
Guilty of what? If he's a thief or a jay walker it's not that bad but if he's a murder I'd rather him not be walking free. Sure it's bad for that one guy in prison who could be killed, but that's one guy. The murderer walking free could kill seven more.	Totally true, obviously an innocent man sent down for a crime he did not commit is a huge injustice. How can his time in prison be repayed to him? If a man is wrongly imprisoned for, lets say murder, then he is unfairly serving another persons time, and in certain parts of the world he could be facing the death penalty. A loss of an innocent life. Though what's worse is the actual murderer is free and could commit a massacre in a shopping mall. Say if that happened and 80 people died. Simple maths, i'd rather one innocent person died than 80.	2
I recently read lord of the flies. to me is seems that most of the charaters were not savage, just stupid (as most young children are). they were blindly following Jack. There were of course those who opposed him, such as piggy and Ralph, who did they best to remind the younger children what must be done in order for them to be rescued.  If you look at is from a metaphorical perspective, Piggy represents a sane person, jack a misled person, and the young children represents an uninformed public. While there is a man speaking with reason, the one who is speaking more about desires than reason that gets the attenion of the public. the media will focus on people like jack, leaving the good ideas in the shadows.  the book is not my favorite, but it does have a good message; Man's greatess enemy comes from his own ignorance. not that man is evil.	The characters were indeed savage, but they were not at all stupid. The problem with Ralph and Piggy was the fact that they could not stand up for there cause (the fire for rescue). Ralph was in unfortunate position as Jack already had followers of him ( the choir), therefore Ralph didn't have alot of trust in the beginning. I do agree with you on the media attention though, and its the medias fault for causing problems.	2

violence is not bad it is just teaching us who to kill people in the not so far future	That sentence made no fucking sense. Stop acting like you are retarded and type out a lucid response, jackass.	2
That is definately true, but I still do not think it is going to happen. NK is to small with to little amount of allies, compared to the US. Both countries could start WWIII but something could happen to another country that could start a WWIII but I think that it will not be in the next 10 years.	Well, if something were to happen that would prevent the U.S. from waging war (like..., the U.S. going bankrupt, for example) then they may go for it. I think that it is a possibility that we will go bankrupt if we keep on printing money and bailing companies out.	2

It's like four in the morning here. lol	"lol ok :P well in that case, emotional abuse is far far worse than physical abuse, they both have psychological damaging effects but im pretty sure attacking someones emotions is a more ""effective"" way of abusing someone, i mean dont get me wrong, physical abuse is damaging and can have permanent effects, but so does emotional abuse and if youre emotionally abused you feel like no one loves you, whereas physical abuse you just build up rage and hatred towards the abuser... i think... idk, it is pretty early lol"	2
I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although I have never seen god, that makes more sense than evolution. What kind of an argument is that?! The evidence for evolution has primarily come from four sources: 1. the fossil record of change in earlier species  2. the chemical and anatomical similarities of related life forms  3. the geographic distribution of related species  4. the recorded genetic changes in living organisms over many generations. <a href='http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm'>http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm  Had you taken the time to do a little RESEARCH you would have stumbled upon evidence that suggests evolution is more likely than a being that decided to create our Universe.  By the Way, you have been misinformed: it's not apes, it's chimpanzees.	Correction, it's an ancestor of both chimpanzees and humans.	2

Animals do not need to marry to have sex so why should we? We are animals after all."	"There is nothing wrong with sex before marriage or ""fornication"" as you zealots call it. Sex is a natural thing and marriage is a humanly constructed thing. Animals do not need to marry to have sex so why should we? We are animals after all.  But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.  -1 Corinthians 7:2"	2
Down vote with no rebuttal. Obvious depiction of how I'm right and someone is too frustrated by how much smarter I am than them to explain themselves. How sad.	I've drank enough booze to disregard the debate. But, I will state that most all women want to be victimized.  Why? Do females want to screw or do they rather want to have their brains screwed out? (no explanation) Who is being penetrated? (no explanation) See, women want to be ravaged, they just don't want anyone to know that they like it. (No, I am not refering to a rapist, I am refering to a female who loves being ravaged by a man of her own liking, while at the same time having reservations about not being ravaged well enough.)	2
Downvote and no explanation?	So did I so apparently everybody got down voted. Been here for 3 hours and not having any fun	2
Ok. I know you exist, but I don't really know you. Lol  	He Is The Owner	2
I notice that you make a lot of debates in one day and you are ranked as number one on this site. Do you make these in order to gain points? Is there a goal to reach for having a lot of points?	He needs them to remain as number one. Otherwise he will lose his ranking.	2
Oh, I didn't know that .	Oh, I didn't know that . I suppose it's rude to up-vote without posting a comment, so yeah, that was me.	2
I never did, you did. Jesus never preached that for the gentiles, and that's what we are.	That's what I am saying he said. Jesus said there is no need to cut off your dick, that's why they followed him.	2
I'm going to post over here because, like Joe, I have not be a victim of this either... But I was the victim of Cerin's downvoting whorefest a while ago. But he left the site for good (I think) :D As a side note, was it really necessary to make a huge debate about this? That's really low-class. I see your argument about how you've pointed it out and everything, but maybe it would've been best to gather a few people and get them to all tell him the same rather than publicly humiliate somebody like this. :(	I thought the same thing when I first saw the debate but sometimes exposure in this way does justice to those who have been harmed by not down voting properly and then taking a hike so as not to face it. My down voting was just recent, like within a day of this debate so mine was fresh in my mind and his stats proved true to what I stated.	2
I agree with you on atheism being the exact opposite of theism. As fro the picture, it was a stereotypical view on the subject, to try to keep things mellow. I did the same with the picture representing this debate.	Ha, leave it to me to take the mellow out of a debate. It just seemed like a good jumping off point so I went for it.	2
"HAHA I wish these guys could just die of every fucking disease, Republicans don't give a shit about minorities If you were alive many years ago, you probably would have supported the Republicans. Up until 1964, Democrats were viewed as the ""Southern"" political party. Do you know which party ended slavery? The Republicans. The Democrats supported slavery. The KKK was actually created by a group of Democrats. Times have obviously changed, but the fact of the matter is that the Democratic party, as well as the USA, would be very different if they had gotten their way regarding the abolishment of slavery. In a sense, the Democratic party that you (I assume that's who you support) and many others support, was created by the Republicans. There are without a doubt, some conservative nut jobs out there... but the same goes for liberals. What it comes down to is who is the better candidate. Choosing someone because of the letter that appears next to their name is retarded. That is why we keep getting shitty presidents.  Carter(D) sucked, so we elected Reagan(R). Reagan was good, so we elected Bush(R). Bush wasn't so great, so we elected Clinton(D). Clinton was impeached after a lot of controversy, so we elected Bush(R). Bush was a mess, so we elected Obama(D). Do you see the pattern? It isn't the party that matters, it's the candidate."	Screw knowledge. .	2
Cartman was looking for a cool comic. Nailed it ;)	Yes you certainly did.	2
It's virtually impossible for America to pay off its debt in the next few years. A more reasonable goal would be to balance the budget in the next few years.	America will collapse as a nation before the debt is paid off, balancing the budget will probably never happen.	2
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that kids under 2 years old not watch any TV and that those older than 2 watch no more than 1 to 2 hours a day of quality programming. The first 2 years of life are considered a critical time for brain development. TV and other electronic media can get in the way of exploring, playing, and interacting with parents and others, which encourages learning and healthy physical and social development.	I agree, but then that would require parents to have parenting skills that don't involve plopping thier kids in front of the TV and having it raise them for them.	2
Ha! I actually remember this skit. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. This is totes funny.	Lol yeah I loved his shows, man I wish he was still on TV making them, he loved to push the envelope with his comedy that for sure.	2
Not points but the efficiency meter, were it says your percentage, it goes down when someone down votes you.	You don't have a clue what I was referring to. 	2
Of course not, Darwinian Evolution doesn't include enough evidence, even Darwin admitted that. He also assumed a lot of things.	I think that evolution, regardless of the insane amount of errors and faulty science, will continue to gain popularity. I agree also with Cuaroc to an extent as well. By the time I die, the only real battle will be between Islam and the atheists... Christianity will be almost completely wiped out.	2
Only problem with that idea is that we as a species are really good at screwing with natural selection. If nature had its way then every time some idiot did something that has the potential to kill them then eventually they would die and the species would be better off. However, with advances in medical technology these stupid people have to try extra hard in order to possibly kill themselves and that has caused their genes to stay in the gene pool. Then they reproduce at a faster rate then people who are not stupid and it starts to get to the point where evolution is not even the correct term to describe it, it's more like reverse evolution.	Exactly. One up vote. We are experiencing de-evolution. Or devo for short ;)	2
Having flashbacks!!! LMAO !!!!!	I know, right !	2
What they want is the right to marry, not be legally united, whatever that is. That is all marriage is under the law, being legally united. A traditional marriage and a civil union are the same except for the title.	Yes, but the title comes with benefits. People will definitely look differently on your resume if they see 'legally united' over 'married'. It's all well and good that everyone has a water fountain, but if that separate water fountain isn't really the same, then it's not fair.	2
I agree with that... problem is most people don't want to hear the bad news so the way the system is set up... it encourages the candidates to lie to us so they can get elected.... then we get disappointed with the results.	Yes, I agree with both of you. But I don't care if it is total honesty or all lies. It just has to be all one or the other. If this is the case, then you will at least know how badly yoo are going to get it!	2
"Stitch in the side ? I'll tell you what gave me a stitch in the side; my gallbladder surgery. When my doctor told me I needed surgery; I said ""he must have some gall, to tell me that"".  And speaking of my bladder; I must go to the bathroom seventeen times a day. And why do they call it a bathroom? I mean any room with a toilet and sink is called a ""bathroom""? I don't know about you, but I have never bathed in a sink."	you know what i mean. -_- and wow. i mean. i'm not really sure to what i should feel about your surgeries and bathroom trips. :/	2
"That guy would be more like ' that homie just chaffed my new white nike airs F* THAT MO FO!! ' He would light him up. Then they would have a "" homie "" war and it would end up in a lot more deaths than if those 2 "" gangstaz "" those "" OGs "" had just had a fist fight."	you have to pass a jail and sanity test first	2
Oh there'll be fun soon enough :) Once you weather the trolls, drama and general craziness.	Trolling? I am kinda familiar with that. How does drama start? Isnt that impossible on this site?	2
"""It was a joke, get a grip."" I know. ""I always thought Iraq was a bad idea "" Fair enough, that still doesn't mena you didn't support it. ""I didn't know that you spoke for all of Europe and the Islamic world?"" NOt just the Islamic world, and Europe, you forgetting all of asia, africa, and south, and central america;-) ""I hope you get paid well for that."" If you think what your country did in Iraq didn't lower your repuation wolrdwide, and also severely damage the credibility of the international community to adjudicate on matters of international security then you really delluded."	As I said, I always thought going into Iraq was a bad idea.	2
I think they should be camouflage. It might make it easier to hide from crazed gun-men. Urban camo for school uniforms.	How about this , Make them wear UPS uniforms. That would be very camo in urban areas LOL	2
"1. That statistic is not true. They found that more high school students smoke weed then cigs. With adults, more people still smoke cigs. The majority of the demand for these products doesn't come from teens in school, it comes from adults with money to spend. 2. You're idea that ""If both are illegal, I think the people who are in the less category will transfer over"" is really quite ridiculous. Marijuana is by far the most popular illegal drug, did people switch over from other drugs to pot and shut down their markets? No. Did people decided to only take LSD or shrooms? No, they took both. If people want it, they'll supply it."	Then I rescind my argument.	2
When I look at your avatar I see a Doobie Brother with a dash of Jack Sparrow and a splash of the Grateful Dead, LOL	Yeah... I uploaded this one a couple days ago but it didn't appear on my end until last night.	2
How about this , Make them wear UPS uniforms. That would be very camo in urban areas LOL	That just might work... lol	2
No, he's going to be up there for healthcare reform. It will save us billions and allow for a longer and healthier life. It's something we should have done when Nixon tried to do it. In the short term, he will get huge credit for not allowing this insane congress to push the U.S. off the fiscal edge and completely ruin our credit rating. But people like yourself who cannot accept that anything this president does is a great accomplishment will do as you are doing, say it's about color of skin.	also delighted hes at least fighting for tighter gun laws, better enforced and hopefully getting the military style asault weapons from our streets. also obama understands his healthcare bill has more chance of finding and helping these mental health issues which sees these maniacs grab a gun and kill innocent people. its a sick joke that the far right are suddenly demanding help for mental health issues, this takes government involvement to weed out the millions with mental health issues in such a massive nation of 330 million is beyond the private sector, it takes government and it takes taxes. something the far right wont pay.	2
You say setting the example, what example are you talking about?	Well you are now in charge of someones life. You get to set the rules and example that they live by. Do you want them going out and partying at a young age?	2
I think the American Justice System is alright. I mean we stick it to some of the criminals. I think that sometimes it could be a little tougher. Sometimes many people do get away with crimes and find ways to get around many things.	I agree. And I would add that anyone who criticizes our justice system should offer an alternative or suggest improvements to the system. It's a lot easier to yell from the peanut gallery than to try and enact positive changes.	2
Please understand we KNOW George killed Trayvon. He has admitted to it. What I am trying to say is not if Geroge was justified in killing Trayvon, but was George motivated by race?	I just picked an answer so I could comment. I just want to forget this artificial race stuff. Our religion teaches in Acts 17:26 that we are all one human race. I has a a sad. :'(	2
Yup. 	Gravity can alter time... Time goes slower the closer you are to Earth, and when you are in motion.	2
I want to bumfuck you.	I dont want you to do that.	2
Sell Texas. You'd be killing two birds with one stone. You'd be raising money and getting rid of the Texans.	Uhm..., you do realize that I would never advocate selling a red state...., right? ;)	2
"Is this any different than a Christian-in-training ""crying out for the lord"" in church and ""feeling something"" afterwards? The quality of a trip is largely dependent on mental processes. Think bad thoughts, you're gonna have a bad time etc.. Were you to have engaged in a mental exercise of breathing in green energy and breathing out black energy, you might have experienced the same change in trip. Oh, and you know, god's will seems to be inexorably tied to the laws of man (it was once ok to kill, and now in our soccer mom-led society, Christians are little more than harmless bible readers). I think this is proof of the power of our thoughts on our bodies :)"	"And if you French fry when you should pizza, you gonna have a bad time.  I think that a lot of people can't/aren't taught to understand the power of positive thoughts and energies as more formless ideas, so they have a need to attribute these things to a more concrete form. So, religious people who will mock meditation as an effect form of positive change will turn around and praise the power of prayer.  I wouldn't say that ""Christians are little more than harmless bible readers"". Granted they aren't conducting crusades anymore, but fighting using laws and policies can be very harmful and fatal too. (of course the previous statement does not apply to most Christians, it's the severe outliers I'm referring to)"	2
Not more so than you .	Are you a Poe (or being satirical) or do really believe what you're saying? (Talking to God, redefining words, etc)	2
Socialism! Only junk food is free market! Healthy food means the government is going to steal your first born! Just kidding. Of course there should be healthy food. In fact, they're kids, they should only have healthy options and their freedoms be damned. These fucking kids are getting too fat.	In fact, they're kids, they should only have healthy options and their freedoms be damned. Depending on the grade, I suppose, but at some point these kids are going to be in the adult world and they are going to have to make their own food health decisions so denying them unhealthy but tasty food choices now could have negative unintended consequences later. I say give them the choice now between healthy food and unhealthy food and encourage them (not mandate them) to make intelligent food choices. Give the students both healthy and unhealthy food choices, and allow them to make the choices they will eventually have to make on their own. Prohibiting unhealthy food will only make it appear even more attractive.	2
No but you should.  on a side note Ban Me! Ban Me!	As you wish, inferior point-whore wannabe. ;)	2
Well, humans are the masters of millions of dogs and cats. Humans control the population and protect thousands of species everyday. Yeah, we are superior.	The light at the end of the forest. A pillar of logic in a sea of infidels. An ally worthy of alliance. What would I do without you?	2
Me too! Rainbow party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Hahaha! There had been people guessing before, Hellno brought it up a little while ago.  Now the cat's outta' da bag. Not that it makes much difference either way really. Luckily I go both, OH YEAH!	2
Cod and Halo are geared towards anyone over 18. Video games in general have no target audience. Anyone can play. MLP is targeted SPECIFICALLY at girls ages 1-10ish. If not that then just females in general. When a grown fucking man watches something like that, how can you not call homo? I'm all for women's equality. Play video games, drive monster trucks, own companies, play football, whatever. But grown ass males should NOT be watching My Little Pony. And at the very damn least, not watch it and then wonder why everyone is calling you a faggot. I'm not homophobic. I just personally see this as a stupid, childish, and in some cases disturbing act that needs to, at the very least, stop being praised.	"I'm clarifying your argument so as to avoid casting a vote to either side of this horribly skewed debate. Can't vote for either; the choices come down to GAY or essentially ""Almost Gay."" That is complete bullshit and you should be ashamed for posting a debate like this. Back on topic- last time I checked, whether or not someone was gay, straight, or bi, depended on their relative level of attraction towards the same sex and the opposite sex. The entertainment they partake in, while it may be correlated (even strongly correlated) with one sexual orientation or the other, does not imply ANYTHING regarding their sexuality. Not a fan of the show myself, but really- grow up."	2
"I shall paste my reply to TheThinker here: In murder, in burns, in theft and many other crimes there are scales of measuring the severity of them, most commonly (although in theft there are four) there are three classes of the crime. Rape is merely any form, whatsoever, of sexually connoted assault. In the first class division is the type of rape whereby permanent scars and/or broken bones are left for the victim to deal with, any and all paedophilic rape (including something as simple as a forced kiss to an under 18 year old) falls under this category. In the second class category is the type of rape whereby any severe bruising or temporary effects are left/seen on the victim. It also depends on whether or not there was any verbal threat involved. If the person,a t any point in the rape, said something along the lines of ""I will kill you"" or ""I will break you"" or something that is a threat of the actions of a first class rape, they could, depending how good or bad the lawyers representing the defendant and victim are, could get them done for first class rape instead. Essentially second class rape is simply brutal sex where there didn't appear to be any consent from the other party. Third class rape is any sexual act done onto a non-minor that isn't anything past second base but still is totally and utterly without the victim's consent."	Lolwut? I don't think I posted anything on this debate till now... XD	2
Anarcho capitalism, rule of law is strictly common law provided by competing entities where it would adjudicate acts of violence, disputes, violation of contracts and protect property. Everything else would be market forces.	Would you have regulations to prevent certain corporations from gobbling up too much of the market demographic and perhaps getting out of hand?	2
The election is in 2016, the new POTUS won't take office until January, 2017.	Okay. Thanks for clarifying.	2
I notice that you make a lot of debates in one day and you are ranked as number one on this site. Do you make these in order to gain points? Is there a goal to reach for having a lot of points?	I'm generally interested in debates. If you check my waterfall most of my answers are a couple of paragraphs longs.	2
Well your question was based on the problems religious ideologies caused for this country, while my question was more based on discrimination, but if you feel I ripped you off I really did not mean to LOL!	Well, you took it and you expanded it. For that, I tip my hat.	2
All those posts couod have been posted at once. You didnt have to break it up.	he couldn't spam points for his side if he did it in one post.	2
Have them arrested, an eye for an eye will leave the world blind, yes its awful what happened, and a terrible tragedy, and he deserved to die to, but hatred is not a good response... but i would risk going to prison to kill someone who killed my kid	I don't think someone killing your child is similar to the hypothetical case stated in the desciption.	2
Would you say that debate is the highest form of any activity that shares the attributes you listed?	If I understand your question right, yes. I think debate is the highest form of conflict resolution. However it is quite possible to debate in a manner inconsistent with the philosophy.	2
women arent a species you flipping frac-dawg!!!!	OH YES THEY ARE, AND A CONFUSING ONE TOO. But by golly, they are an adorable one indeed.	2
By this you mean is there practically no limit to what we can achieve? If so I'm obligated to believe this, as of late and as my hobby of being a tricker. Recently I pushed my boundaries by staying up later into the next day practicing my tricking.	Isn't it as Einstein put it so eloquently that...“Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.”	2
Your optimism turns me on. 	Alrighty then	2

No... the arrow isn't pointed at you  Oh, but the arrow is pointing off the left of the screen, so all I have to do is turn my computer and the arrow is pointed at me. I don't even know why you're on CD?  Why are you asking me? Shouldn't you know what you know? I guess because you're afraid of being beat on an issue? Or you just don't understand any issues?  I don't know. At least you are intelligent enough to know that.	Thanks for proving my point. :D	2
Animes are cartoons so...	I agree with Prodigee. .	2
Why do you hate Christmas Warjin? Why? God! You're such a hater!	I LOVE Christmas, toys for everyone: ) , well almost but you get what im saying lol, I just hate hearing how there is a War on Christmas when there clearly isnt, also whats wrong with saying happy holidays, I figure this covers all the holidays in one shot. Fox News is just butt hurt because Jesus isnt the only player in town around December 25th lol, besids the date is wrong anyways, December 25th is a pagan holiday that Christians once again stole as there own like just about everything else in that book of lies.	2
Dare I poke the zombie that is a thousand days old? XD	So...., are you a rug licker. ;)	2
I support freedom of speech and all of that but there's also a certain boundary you don't cross when broadcasting something to a very large audience. It's pretty much just for the children and the weak hearted. They deserve the freedom to flip channels and not see man-dong or hear large amounts of salty sailor talk. Now, given the appropriate time(around midnight when children are asleep) and proper warning I believe there should be a lax on the censorship. Which is... how the system is set up right now anyways.	"Yeah, yeah, but there's also a bigger argument to think of here. What's the point of these bans on ""language?"" Why do people care so much and who decided that these were ""bad words?"""	2
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD OR A MOVIE OR SOMETHING? IF ITS THE END OF THE WORLD YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THEN I DON'T THINK SO. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THE WORLD WILL END FOR YEARS NOW. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MAYAN CALENDER, SOME PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE EXISTED. THEY'RE GONNA FEEL SO STUPID WHEN WE'RE IN 2013.	I agree it's not as if the Mayans were a reliable source they did'nt predict the Spanish coming and wiping them out so why should we believe that they could predict the end of the world in 2012	2
sorry never wanted to dispute but these teams are out of FIFA by the way I'm supporting Spain I really hope it will win this year	Well, my prediction was 22 days ago.----------------------------	2

is it my fault i can't speak, or that my body becomes weak.. or that i can hardly move at the very thought of you? nothing ever really got to me; i could always turn the other cheek. could it be those days are gone ? could've sworn that i was strong at least stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions but they're taking over me no no no no this can't be it; the less you are the less she is. no no no no 'cause i can usually handle this; its just i wasn't ready for these. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions, but they're taking over me. you're the silence in a roaring crowd; you're the equivalent of a fluffy cloud; a genie in a bottle: make a wish to wish the wishes will never end. you're the platinum in my treasure chest. you're the answer that i never woulda guessed. i'm a love life test and i don't mind at all; i don't mind at all. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions that are taking over me. i swear i'm stronger than these emotions, but they're taking over me.	oooooh urbangermany is so cute. ANNND he can sing. (;	2
Now, how do we measure equal? Are we intellectually superior? Intrinsically more valuable? More powerful? As far as I can reason, the only criteria for measuring equality would have to be based on the intrinsic value of different beings. Yeah, humans kind of conquered the planet, but only by the grace of evolutionary happenstance. For all we know, dolphins could be as intellectually capable as humans but without the physical ability to develop the kinds of technologies that have allowed us to rise to the top of the food chain.  Here's a question: If aliens arrived on earth and had technology far beyond anything we were capable of, or even if they were so intellectually advanced that they had conscious awareness to a degree we could never fathom (effectively making them gods in comparison to us), would that reality detract from the intrinsic value of our humanity? Is the value of our humanity dependent on reality? Because the reality we experience is not necessarily an objective, true reality. So if these aliens already exist and we just don't know about them, does that make us less valuable by default? And what if said aliens proclaimed that humans were, in fact, inferior -- worthless even? What then? They're smarter, so does that make it so? Would we accept a fate as slaves to alien master or some bio-resource to be exploited? Or would we fight for our progeny and recognize that the aliens are no better than us and our perceived worthlessness is just circumstantial? Given these things to consider, I don't think we can definitively say that we are in any value-sense 'above' another species, especially considering that we wouldn't be able to sustain ourselves if we weren't part of an extremely complex ecological network. That network doesn't only include other life, but even physical landforms and forces of nature. And to deter anyone from pegging me as a 'hippie', which seems to be the go-to term everyone on this site uses to denote anyone who is vaguely liberally minded, I love eating meat. So much so that I've slaughtered yearling calves, chickens, and rabbits to harvest the stuff. And I'm all for violence in appropriate situations. And I will fully indulge in my privileges as a human being while I'm here.	Yes. Too vague of a question really. Are we animals? Yes. Do animals go on trial? No. Should we however mercilessly slaughter them? No.	2
Just a little note when you disagree with someone you click dispute and when you agree with someone you click the support button.	Well you can't blame me im new-ish and getting use to this and when in not loged in i usually go to youtube.	2
It depends, as so many things do, on the maturity of said child. I would like to think that my child would be mature enough not to pull an Amanda Todd... Oh.... Too soon?	Ha! Good one. XD  And I must say that's a very convincing statement. I probably shouldn't have my computer in my room based on the things that I've done but my parents somewhat trust me so...	2
This is from my heart. I want you to remain intact. Block all incoming negativity.	I did. I now block all enemies from my debates. I see that people are following me around and down voting me. Oh mon Deu, c'est tragique!	2
I think it is kind of cute because it is a watch cat instead of a watch dog my cat does this I love it when He jumps on people.	Well, this wasn't really about the cat but about people creeping on your profile page, LOL! Here's a song about it that I bet you can appreciate since it features MJ! ;)	2

"I use the jump feature. A lot. Just to see where everyone is and what I can expect to come up in a minute or two. For example, that guy who always posts debates about women and what a loser he is with them. I used it on him once and saw he was making a new debate and my first thought was ""ugh, not again."" Sure enough a minute later, he did it again. X) But I have clicked on a lot of people to find them on my profile. My only reaction is that I need to creep on their profile back. If I debate with them a lot it's not that weird, but if I've never talked to them before, that is weird. >.>"	LMAO! Well a certain Irishman is always looking at my page and I hardly ever interact with him any more? Maybe he's just looking for a drinking buddy? LOL	2

Believe me, if you are not married and that is what you are sending to people you ""love"" then that is not real love."	100% AGREED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
Based off the information provided Yes. But was there actually an Ark? another topic.....	There was a man that claim to have seen the Ark, but it snowed before he was able to get to it. Pretty cool thing to look up on.	2
"I don't really think there's any proof that he did unless he admits it. If you click on his score (next to his user name) you get a full breakdown of his activities. You'll see that recently he has downvoted 4 arguments on the ""Is prostitution the ultimate victimless crime"" debate, without having added a single argument of his own."	I see. Than he is just another down voter. touche. - - - - - - - - - -- - - -	2
No, do not let my avatar fool you. Eucalyptus is for losers.	A platypus friend of me said it was a 'gateway' drug.... be careful dude.	2
I believe the Big Bang theory created the universe, and that it was an entirely random event.	Yes, but then you are kind of making Big Bang your God. You (atheist, not you personally) tell me, that I believe in magic. But do you see, how I feel just the same about your belief? I think it is pretty magical, that this beautiful world is made from .. big bang. What I mean is, that our beliefs are just as crazy.	2
You won't miss it. It happens over time. True love doesn't just happen when you meet someone and that is where a lot of people are mistaken. There's also a lot of other situations that people would mistake for true love.	True love doesn't just happen when you meet someone and that is where a lot of people are mistaken.  when does it happen then? you know, so i have a better idea what i'm up against. ;)	2
Oh man! I guess you guys are screwed either way then ;)	And you're not? That makes yours a very curious statement.	2
I Believe everyone should have the same rights, sexual orientation, gender, race etc should not effect anything.  Adoption - If there are so many poor children put up for adoption by no fault of there own, then why should gay or lesbian couples not be able to care for them. People claim that it must be horrible for the child being adopted due to being bullied, but i have read stamens from these children, saying its mad that anyone would prefer them to be moving from care home to foster home when there are gay couples willing to adopt.  Marriage - When two people in love, have a lawfully recognised bond, gay people should have the option to that, as a human right i my opinion!!!	Well, if the adopting gay couple are not the type that go to gay pride parades dressed in leather, S&M;outfits then they should be allowed to adopt.  As far as getting married, right now they can have a wedding and no one will throw them in jail. So, are you talking about them receiving benefits like tax deductions? If so, that's up to the government. When the government hands out benefits like farm subsidies, am I entitled to get farm subsidies? Am I being discriminated against if I don't get farm subsidies?	2
PC has Steam. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_software'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_software  PC has mods. PC has emulators. PC wins.	Plus keyboard and mouse are much more accurate and faster than a controller.	2
Learning a new language not only makes you more tolerant to other cultures, but it improves brain function.	I know, right? :D	2
Well, it really depends what northern perspective you are looking at it from. For some of the North it was about slavery, for most of the North it was about preserving the union. For Lincoln it was mainly about the union.	Indeed it was. Lincoln used slavery as an issue later on into the war to gain more support.	2
Why ? Theres no need to post them there . He just posted them here.	Because I like the music box. It's like a one stop deal. You go there and there it is ;)	2
It's not too young to date. It is, on the other hand, too young to have intercourse. I suggest shock therapy to stop this from happening. It's not like it will kill them.	LOL...how about a little frontal lobotomy to go with that?	2
Much more entertaining to read the old stuff. Both are packed with copied fables and practically plagiarized messages, but if I have to read some trite trash I'd like a little violence and drama thrown in.	And don't forget the sex... ;)	2
Perhaps we don't agree on what the disease actually is. Clarify that and we will clarify how to treat the symptoms.  What do you think is the cause of racism?	I don't think racism is the only problem with the people being separated, as for the cause of it. I think it's people, indoctrinated by their parents, to hate another group, or a really bad experience with someone of that group. A long way to getting groups to unite, is to pretty much pay them off. It might not end the hate, but the indifference might begin to go away, turning the hate into indifference and eventually it'll e mostly cleared up.	2
No I don't talk to bushes and there is actually a plant that lights itself on fire but doesn't burn.	Well.... I'm not going to piss you off just in case. ;)	2
Intangible. He was kind of funny at first, now he just makes it his mission to annoy people. That wouldn't be such a big deal if my argument activity wasn't full of down-votes and pointless comments from him.	Yeah... he's an idiot fo sho. I have zero respect for him. Prodigee at least stands for something and Dana at least tried to but Intang just... Nada! He has no point. Stands for nothing. Nothing that he says means... anything.	2
But they are dead. If you cut them to pieces, they will not feel it. If you insult them, they will shed no tears - they are without life. Without life means they have no feelings, no sentience. Even if you believe that they have a spirit, many believe that the spirit leaves the body after death - there is absolutely no remains of the previous life other than the 'shell'.	But the person chose to be buried for whatever reason, this question has made me ponder a bit, and I think I'd prefer to donate my organs and have the waste of my body thrown to the sea, so I could be of use to something. I think it's the morality behind this that got me fired up, this is the wish of a deceased person's family, and probably one of the deceased themselves, and one which I feel should be respected and held with high regard.	2
We could start taming dinosaurs, and have them fight against each other and name all their cool and unique moves. We could have those go out and collect each individual dinosaur at the age of ten, call themselves, a dinosaur trainer. Have gyms set up where gym leaders battle dinosaur trainers, and if they are beaten they give the trainer a badge. If you collect all eight badges you can go to a dinosaur tournament where all the best trainers go to battle each other's dinosaurs. We can nickname them, and have a strong philosophy revolving around young kid's love between their dinosaurs and them. ;)	And we could make a cartoon show of it. We could call it Pokesaurs or Dinomons!	2

Yes I love cotton candy especially the blue kind.  	I am going back and remember these debates I made years ago lol.	2
Yes, but then you are kind of making Big Bang your God. You (atheist, not you personally) tell me, that I believe in magic. But do you see, how I feel just the same about your belief? I think it is pretty magical, that this beautiful world is made from .. big bang. What I mean is, that our beliefs are just as crazy.	"Yes, but then you're kind of making the Big Bang your God.  That's like saying anyone who believes in the universe having a cause believes in a ""god."""	2
But the Bible says that the rapture will occur and you still won't believe? You know when everyone is left behind its going to be very terriable. And you have 7 years to ethier convert or just stay where your belief is.	I didn't say I wouldn't believe, just that I wouldn't convert. Big difference. And it doesn't matter if I do. Either way I have to suffer for those seven years. lol	2
Well.. Incidently I happen to have super powers too...! What are your Powers? I dunno about a sidekick... But, I can be a good enemy! I'm more of the Evil!	Well... I have the ability to tune people out when they're talking to me, I can play guitar so beautifully that sometimes people may stop to listen, and I'm super strong... but only when I'm versing someone smaller and weaker than me and preferably white.	2
much more accurate and is more likely to stop a threat. like my AR-15 XD	There really is no reason to have such a large gun though. Are you trying to stop an elephant, or a tank? A small accurate handgun like a Walther ppk (the gun my dad used) is much more reasonable.  Now if your paranoid we're going to have a revolution or something then maybe your assault rifle is alright, but I don't see the use.	2
You can make anything sound like a drug if you word it correctly. Eating breakfast can and often does cause a person to feel energized in the morning and prepare for the day.	"Your body is designed to want food. Breakfast is not addictive though. Saying "" Oh I want more things with sugar in!"" is not natural."	2
Trees are made of soil, so yes .	Are you sure? Have you seen the process? 	2
Meh? I liked shooting the chickens.	"Agreed. It seems to be more of a ""timekiller"" game."	2
"You're making an appeal to authority, a fallacy.  Like every scientist, Newton believed in things that were untrue. For one, Newton thought the universe was static in position and infinite in span; modern science has proven these beliefs false. More importantly, Einstein and others showed that Newton's Laws are not universally applicable. Newton was also an anti-trinitarian. Should we tell all Catholics and many Protestants, ""Newton rejected the Holy Trinity and he invented calculus, therefore if you don't reject the Holy Trinity too you must reject calculus and the laws of motion""? Next, the limits of our certainty in no way verify the existence of a god. What does a lack of knowledge verify? Absolutely nothing. Fortunately, the human race has been endowed with minds brilliant enough to always push forward into the uncertainty. If everyone shared your thinking, we would have been satisfied with the Sumerian Pantheon."	Ad Hominem fallacy! Very good response. Honestly I'm pretty sure I wrote that to fuck with someone who wrote an unintelligent argument. I just like to make idiots who don't know what they're talking about confused or at least willing to write a good argument. I would never use such a weak argument against someone with a good argument. Thank you fir shitting on my face though :)	2
I'm surprised they have'nt already or maybe they've realised that freedom is one of the big selling points of the Android system	They haven't already because they must first neutralize Apple. ;)	2
"Yeah, I guess I feel I only have the authority to speculate in regards to the U.S. I do think other nations could abide by such a legal system in a way that is pragmatically effective, but I don't think any legal system based on the above statement would actually be supporting the people. I think most of the efficacy of such a legal system would stem from the public's understanding that the consequences of their actions are somehow more concrete, more permanent. The idea of doing time for stealing (or any other crime) or the idea of a fine is a little more abstract, and I think when people have a lapse in judgment our legal system (my legal system? I'm assuming you're American) may not do as much to actually sway their final decision since they may not have a true awareness of what they're getting themselves into. But as effective as an ""eye for an eye"" legal system may be, I see it as something that relies primarily on fear rather than on the understanding that certain actions are considered criminal because they are a detriment to society. I'm not saying our system is much better as it allows most people to pay their way out of trouble without helping them make a real paradigm shift. And you bring up a good point about the penalty for stealing in Saudi Arabia. Neither of us see it as a fair punishment, but fair is culturally relative. I'm all for the humane treatment of criminals, but perhaps most of the populace of Saudi Arabia sees this as humane enough. If that's so, it's difficult to say whether anyone should try to change their customs. That gets into an ethical debate which has many sides to it, and I'm not sure where I fall."	Yeah, the idea of making a countries populace fear you is just repression. This legal system would either require those who are under it to WANT to have this system, which would be very strange indeed, or for them to fear it. However, when a country fears their Government, it doesn't seem like a great system, because then it's just like you have a fascist or communist regime, which many people don't agree with. And I'm in the UK, so it's basically the same system, just a few differences from what I'm aware of.	2
Well yeah that's what I've been saying the man gets a say but only if he stays around once he leaves he forfeits his say.	You're arguing for disagree now. I just feel I should let you know that. The reason we've been in unending dispute over this though is because you disagree with my opinion on the choice of the mother overall. I still feel abortion should she choose to do it or not, is always her choice, yet when the baby is born that it then becomes partially his responsibility.	2
No one said abortion. Woah! This is about the right to choose death. If it can talk and says I don't want to live, why shouldn't it be allowed to die, or not be born?	I just said why not.	2
That's assuming all drugs are addictive. I won't list the ones that aren't but I'm just stating that a drug doesn't have to be different. If it causes a change in your physiology it could be considered a drug, but sugar doesn't breach that barrier, it's just a food.	Ah, but coffee is just a drink...	2
I agree, the issue between the Kurds and Turkey is a little more complicated than the other areas, but given that the other areas were being broken up, something would have to be done with the Kurds, and I think giving them to Turkey is better than giving them to Syria or Iran. I also hadn't thought about Baghdad, and don't have an answer for that, but I also don't think one city should block a resolution that is good for the rest of the country. Even though Baghdad is diverse, I think the land around it is mostly Shiite (I'm not sure of that, it's been a while since I last saw maps that showed this stuff), so I think Baghdad would go to Iran. As for the oil reserves, I think they should just follow the land. There will obviously be a lot of arguing over borderline areas, and this is probably one of the reasons they didn't go this direction. However, I think the biggest reason we didn't divide up the country was that we're enemies with Syria and Iran, and we didn't want to give them anything. All in all, though, I agree with you that we could have avoided all of this mess had Iraq never been formed in the first place. I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it obviously hasn't worked out well.	What about this... a confederacy type government. The three areas could have a ton of control over themselves, the central government would be very weak except have a very strong national military (to stop them from fighting each other, no local militias) and oil production would be run by the national gov't too with profits divided up equally. Baghdad would be a neutral territory similar to DC. You know, I've always thought the Kurds got screwed the worst... they were the most friendly to us and with the no fly zone they they practically did have their own little Kurdistan under Saddam.	2
I would side with the Imperial army. They are a lot better and I have been in the Imperials for a long time and I like carrying out missions for them. I have heard that the Stormcloaks are like really weak and a lot of my friends say it isn't worth joining the stormcloaks.	Well I guess technically didn't specify in the debate, but my debate was supposed to be about who you agreed with more, who was in the more right. Yes, though the imperials have better stuff.	2
Trans-dimensional beings who live on a higher plane of existence of us, within space and time.	After many years of Star Trek and binge watching a tons of Sci Fi Shows like Babylon 5, Star Gate & Battlestar Galacticia on Netfix you sir are now speaking my language lol	2
"Hmm, at the time you told me you didn't know who he was and you knew little about philosophy. But now you say you don't like him because of his theories.. You know of his Parisian Café theories? < is why i raged. hearing people saying "" I don't know it but I don't like it "" is so damned stupid! Like refusing to eat a certain food, because "" you don't like it"" yet haven't tried it.  And you told me no one cares about what I said, hence the meanness. And just to add to that, I made a nice long debate for you all to complain to me about on how I am wrong and it makes no sense, e.t.c.  I do love the attention really :)"	"Hmm, at the time you told me you didn't know who he was and you knew little about philosophy. But now you say you don't like him because of his theories..

I thought all vampire already had these traditional powers. People just never mention them.	Whether or not they have them, the super speed of werewolves is faster than that of vampires.	2
Of course not! First off, steroids can be extremely dangerous, so why would you encourage an athlete to do them? Secondly, it will cause inflated records and stats, making the true athletes of the past, who achieved those things naturally, next to forgotten. Sports is about natural ability, not juiced apes.	From my point of view sportsmen must show their own achievments without any help of chemical preparat. When you show your ability, people believe and try to reach heights like you. But cheating can destroy your career at all, everyone will forget you or remember but with a bad memory.	2
"Gay and the N-word are very different. The N-word is from when african-americans were slaves immigrated from africa. I was a purposeful mispronounciation of the nation Niger. Gay on the otherhand, origianlly meant happy. It only recently became a term to descibe a homosexual.  You can try to make an argument that it is not ""politcally correct"" but that is not the mainstream conscious for both the straight and gay communities. I would rather not try to put a whole bunch of red tape around the word."	Oh bullocks. It is bigoted to use gay for stupid. It would be equally bigoted to use straight for stupid, or black for stupid. Gay does not mean stupid.	2
No I never liked her either. I mean it's pretty easy for me to say that now, but seriously, you can ask Dana - I messaged Dana about some doubts I had about Lizzie being real.	I was beginning to doubt, but I was afraid to say anything. Shit was not adding up, you know?	2
"There should be an ""End of the world"" holiday..."	Hahahaha it would only happen once lol. That would be awkward. I would not mind it though.	2
no the people that grew up sexually asulted or crazy people who will proabably abuse the child should not unless there spouse can control them	Very true, though at first glance, it might seem obvious that everyone should be, but you look at mentally disabled people, who will probably not understand sex and what is happening, really mentally deranged people who like to skin cats then wrap other cats in them, really, really should not be. There must be a couple of others, but I can't think of. Some people who are not insane or disabled, but are particularly cruel people who would sell the child in to slave labor just to be able to buy a mars bar or something, should probably not be! Though I'm not going to be the one to decide who gets to keep their child or not, that is wrong.	2
We had a surplus when Bush was first elected. Now we are in a crisis. However, the republican party as a whole needs to be hels accountable. Not Bush. He is not smart enough to have done this much damage.	Every time we go to war we lose our surplus or when our government spends more than what is brought in , the Fed doesn't mind it because they make money of the interest. So every time when congress passes a bill or ask for more money for war they are essentially giving the FED the OK to go ahead and loan us more money that we don't have. Our Government then has to turn them into bonds or treasury notes so that they can be sold on the open market with a guarantee return. That guarantee of return on top of the actual amount that someone bought the bond at has to get paid back. That's how we rack up our deficit. Now how do we pay for all of this? Taxes! The only way that Govco. can do this is to raise taxes. With the current administration spending us into oblivion I can guarantee with absolute certainty that we will pay more taxes for just about everything in order to pay for it all.	2
We are all agnostic but that is not what matters, the question is do you believe? Not do you know?	the question is do you believe? Not do you know? I'm confused. The question is Is Agnosticism bullshit?. I don't understand what you mean, could you clarify?	2
and physical	So true. Heart attacks sound horrible. And refined sugar can be addictive.	2
"The Prince was written to guide a Prince to be good. it didn't actually suggest that Monarchies were the right form of government. The problem is that we have to rely on this guy being a good leader... really? too much to risk, not to mention that Machiavelli suggested that he needed to put fear into us, just not make us hate him. This would obviously lead to strict laws for the ""greater good"". I'm basically just seeing another Stalin."	"That's very true; some evidence indicates that Machiavelli actually preferred republics. And that, too, is a legitimate concern. Which is why I said in my blog, ""Shuddering at the memory of despotic monarchs in history such as King George III, many people wonder why Machiavelli even considers a monarchy."" But the question of the debate was, can it be a good form of government. Which I (and Machiavelli) would say 'yes' to."	2
pokemon is the fucking shit and fifth gen. brought a lot of new power. Fifth gen is stacked with monsters like hydreigon, ferrothorn, the kyurem a and b forms, the genies, darmanitan, and many others. Just because one pokemon is an ice-cream cone does not mean this gen is taking pokemon downhill. Plus N is the most badass champion and zekrom/volcarona are two of the coolest pokemon ever made. This gens metagame is fuckin dope and the story is great. the only downsides are poor graphics and shitty starters	I agree with you on pretty much everything, but poor graphics? Dude, they're awesome! The first time I went through skyarrow bridge to Castelia, my mind was blown. The metagame I feel is not as good as 4th gen (but that's just because Smogon are ban happy dicks), but I've still managed to build a pretty beast NU team.	2
The fact that someone reported you for it is pretty strong evidence. Either it's true or the person who falsely accused you is psychotic. It would be pretty obvious who was lying.	Reporting is not strong evidence, it is HEARSAY. No proof unless witnesses.	2
Even for those on a diet, you should consume at least 1,200 calories a day. Considering this, I think no. Even for a big guy like him, 1200, is for an average person he may be at 3000, I'm not a mathematician, I actually suck at math, but his daily intake should be way less than 24,000.	But what if he didn't eat anything else for the next 8 days, so he was getting 3,000 a day on average?	2
Haha! I should have known... you're a Pepsi person !	Thats right baby, but you still love me! Don't deny it, you will now switch over to Pepsi LOL	2
Lol the movie is probably a bit cheesy.......   I think I could do it no problem.	I you humanoids on here try to sound so high and mighty, claiming to be able to do it no problema. Did you read the part where they said that the previous winner won ever though he only watched 30 minutes?	2
zzz I've obviously confused you due to my lack of specification. I don't feel like going back and making the corrections for it is not worth it. And yes you win Good day Sir.	It is a good day, I won.	2
Mercy killing is not always murder, murder has to be unlawful. So if you are doing it legally you are not murdering. Mercy killing is justifiable of the pain they are living in is worse or will lead to an eventual death before help can arrive anyway. For example on the battlefield away from any medical supplies, if your insides are pouring out of your body, and camp is too far away, one bullet in the head by a best friend is better than letting them die of that painful injury.	I'm not talking about a legal context. Think way out in the wilderness where there are no rules. I don't think the law provides any grounds for manslaughter and considers it all murder. What is a legal mercy killing?	2
But now wait a minute.... didn't we help you guys out during WWII against the Japanese?	because they blew up peal harbor and and wtf is with 50 now it was less once	2
I believe that the purpose of lessons is to ensure that students learn and gain knowledge, with us teachers as their guide on the path of attaining mastery in that particular subject area. For every lesson, lesson objectives should be clearly planned out, and I learnt that students should ideally achieve these objectives at the end of the teacher's lesson. If materials were modified, teachers should of course keep in mind how it is to be used in the classroom, whether it is suitable for that particular profile of students, whether it facilitates better learning and understanding. If materials rank high in terms of flair, but score low in complexity and improving understanding, teachers should either adjust accordingly or consider even using the materials. Ultimately, students' learning should be the main priority.	I strongly agree with Alfian on the part that if materials are ranked high in terms of flair but low in complexity and understanding, then students will come out of the lesson with nothing learnt! Materials should therefore be designed in a moderate level and based on the student's profile. It is always best that we challenge students a tad higher than their own comfort zone.	2
I present the 1990s UK advert for Toys 'R' Us as one of those adverts that always made me smile, and that I still miss today!	Dude that's awesome! I like how retro it is. Have you heard of RetroJunk.com? You should check it out.	2

"Although you are a Green Party 'insert ""joke here"" definition' I didn't know you we're so particular about labels.  That being said; where do you usually meet up?"	LOL, that was chosen mostly as a joke. I'm unaffiliated.	2
Not always true though. For example, look at the stock market. There is a greed-is-good mentality (i.e. people act in their own self interests) but it doesn't always turn out to be a good thing. There are bubbles, there are crashes, there are scandals, there are worthless sub-prime loans rolled up in CDOs!	What would the internet be if there had not been an internet bubble?	2

milk is max 3.5% and that only in summer... why vegan? ...they don't really live long :D	What do you mean milk is max 3.5% ? I've seen milk with 8% milk in the states. I am vegan because I find it odd that human beings are the only specie who continue to drink milk as adults, and also the only specie who drink milk from other species. Vegans live longer :)	2
Ja correction, I made this debate before. Ja, no you didn't. Wasn't your debate that we can't truly know anything? I was peeved off by the fact all you were doing was saying crude and insulting things about Jean-Paul Sartre. You were peeved that I mentioned his name without kissing his ass, then I started insulting him. One. Don't come to my debates if you know nothing of the topic and are not interested in it. People aren't even allowed to come to your debates if they do know what they are talking about because you get all crazy. Nobody cares who you are upset about. You don't even care. You said that I didn't like you because of that debate. You didn't say anything about yourself not liking me because even you realize no one cares who you don't like. :)	"I did several of those. Difference between living and existing, How do you know you exist, can we truly know anything, and a couple of others. Did I ask you to kiss his ass..? You know you can do more than either kiss his ass or insult him. You could perhaps look him up, get to know a little about him, before slagging him off blindly. And what makes you think I don't like you? I like you a hell of a lot more than a lot of other douche bags on this site :L You're fun to argue with, I may come off as angry or raging, but that's because emotions aren't that easy to convey in typing..! And what's with the "" I don't care, no one cares.."" Bit? is that meant to be insulting? I don't mean that in a sarky bitchy way, I am just asking if it was meant to be mildly insulting or not? Because it was."	2
Aminos aren't enough, you would die just on it... You need complex proteins, not just plants, animal. Long time deprivations leads to heart diseases. Meat is more important that you think...	No meat will kill you. Plants can provide you with proteins. It also is best at recovery from illnesses. Meats have fats and those can kill you. Plants are more important than you think.	2
Having the largest standing army means nothing. When it comes time to fight, they are going to be too tired. They should have those guys sit down once in a while ;) Besides, in order to use your army, you have to mobilize them and get them to their destination. Flying that many people would be a logistical nightmare. Just think about how long it takes you to get through the airport lines and into your seat in the plane. ;) I guess you could drive them there in Jeeps and trucks, but everyone knows what bad drivers they are; they will never get out of the country that way due to all the car wrecks ;) I guess you can get them there by boat though. I hear a lot about boat people ;)	Haha!! Like that episode of Family Guy............................................	2

Exactly. People don't consider coffee a drug, for what I can only imagine is because the effects are not as strong as an actual 'drug'.	"Oh well it was my understanding that though people do not think of it as a drug, it still is one. Believe me going to the prudish health and safety school I do, you hear plenty on why "" sunshine is bad for you"" and "" all drugs will kill you the moment you take them"" and other unbelievable bullshit like that! But yes it was my understanding that caffeine was a drug."	2
That's very clever, but could we not just let it slide? If they want to get married, would it be so much effort to just ignore the etymology and let them get married?	"Because that is not marriage. The very nature of marriage precludes non-heterosexual ""marriage"". Union, yes - but the union would not be a ""marriage"", per se."	2
The fuck are you guys talking about? All I see are breasts.	Her eyes are a little bit higher. ;)	2
Some say the same for anime, that it is childish (easily proven that it is not!). I haven't played any modern games myself but if they involve strategy or quick thinking, no.	Thanks, I so agree with you! :)	2
Buddha would be proud of your kindness. .	Buddha would have you committed to a mental institution.	2
I will explain it to you with full details and demonstration LOL	Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee !	2
"The dog could, ""file for divorce"" by running away. If a dog could engage in a marriage like human beings, then it should be under the same marriage laws as human beings. Meaning that it should file a divorce as human beings file divorces."	I wasn't arguing for people being able to marry animals, I was arguing to make bestiality legal. Recognizing the right of two different species to be in a consensual relationship. I'm actually more opposed to necessitating marriage as the demonstration of a committed relationship.	2
Education for illegal immigrants? Yeah, that was real important... I plan to be an immigrant, (I'd rather not say whether it is legal or illegal here), I resent that a little. To be honest though, the dream act can have a lot of practicalities. But you are right, the only thing Barack has going for him is that he is black and does whatever the people want him to do.... passing laws that will get him votes. He is not very impressive.	"I plan to be an immigrant, (I'd rather not say whether it is legal or illegal here), I resent that a little. To be honest though, the dream act can have a lot of practicalities. I don't like the idea of illegal immigrants coming over and taking advantage of our system. I have no problem with someone moving here legally. But you are right, the only thing Barack has going for him is that he is black and does whatever the people want him to do.... passing laws that will get him votes. He is not very impressive. I don't think he does what ""everyone"" wants him to do. He tries to appeal to the minorities rather than everyone. He is very unimpressive, especially considering the fact that he ran on a moral agenda and then ditched it once he got into office."	2
You may already know this but the flying spaghetti monster is essentially a joke. People have acted like it is a real religion out of humor. What happened was this guy whom was making a text book or something was requested to make one based on faith (creation). This man thought it was ridiculousto have schools teach religion so he invented the FSM. Well that is what I heard in school anyway, I'm not sure on that, however it s oftenly used to mock religion.	Yes I already knew it was joke. I just wanted to see what people thought about this matter.	2
I don't celebrate it as much as others, seeing as I was born on Christmas Day.	That has to suck. It sucks for me when easter lands on my birthday, and I don't even celebrate it! But no one can do anything because they're too busy with family.  Christmas would be worse I'd imagine.	2
You don't even think he was a human being?	He is as real person as Gandalf he Grey or Harry Potter .	2
My honest opinion is that when non-believers who don't believe in Jesus Christ and they die they will go to hell because they choose not to believe in Christ but if they repent and turn from their sins and believe in Jesus Christ then they can go to heaven.	Can I ask: do you feel sad that some of your friends are going to burn in hell? If so, what exactly do you do about it?	2
I will keep that in mind. LOL. .	i was afraid rice might be sticking to the ceiling right afterwards but thank god no	2
Yeah, I also try to watch a lot of comedy but there's hardly anything that's worth the time. I've tried the new Jeff Dunham show and it's marginal. So what are you playing now? I'm playing Dragon Age origins.	I really want to play Dragon Age but I've got no money right now. So I'm focused on Modern Warfare 2, which is fuckin' awesome.	2
I saw Satan once. Does that count? .	You saw Satan...? I think you are going to have to share that story...	2
Glad to hear it. In what ways are yall active? Do you contribute money? Write congressmen? Are you members of NORML?	We don't contribute money, being very young and very poor, but I and most of my friends are members of NORML and go to rallies, write congressmen, et cetera.	2
okay I don't get what you just said. Can you explain that better?	Sure. The Earth has a magnetic field. This is why a compass works. The magnetic field can shift. It can also increase and decrease in strength. This magnetic field deflects some of the sun's harmful rays. If the strength of the magnetic field drops, more rays make it to the surface and Earth gets warmer. If the field drops to zero, we roast and bake.	2
I've debated Christianity with him before and he certainly has some issues with the religion	Maybe he's confusing meditating with medicating ;)	2
I rate this as third class rape (assuming there are three classes such as is present in murder).	Is second class fingers and third class the shaft? If so what is the equivalent for a woman raping someone?	2
Just because the pope said something about that atheists can go to heaven doesn't mean he is right. What he said was false because not anyone can get into heaven only through Jesus Christ.	Good job, kiddo. I support you preaching the truth. :)	2
I posted this because I figure I hold a minority opinion. Jiu Jitsu is the gentle art. If you are skilled enough in Jiu-Jitsu, you don't need to injure your opponent. While I understand that since no one has the art perfectly mastered, anyone can find themselves in a position where using brutal techniques (Like striking, biting, eye gouging, and armbars) seems unavoidable.	Polar bears at the zoo are well fed. When someone jumps the fence to pet a polar bear, the polar bear doesn't try to gently help the person safely back over the fence where he belongs. No, the polar bear rips his limbs off. Similarly, when attacked, you don't try to gently persuade the attacker to stop hitting you and give him a chance to take out a gun instead (I'm assuming that the best trained Jiu Jitsu master cannot stop bullets, or snatch them from the air with his teeth). No, you put him in an armbar until his arm pops off. ;)	2
You can't be serious...  	Why? You think he doesn't have any cousins?	2
Why would I need to explain that to you, when I never said it was used in the last years? Read properly before disputing people multiple times- that's called ignorance. If it helps you, read what people say multiple times so you understand it.	You said exactly that, stop denying your false statement multiple times that's called ignorance.	2
"Yeah, yeah, but there's also a bigger argument to think of here. What's the point of these bans on ""language?"" Why do people care so much and who decided that these were ""bad words?"""	"Hm, I'm not really sure. It might just be the vulgarity displayed by the words that make them so. I mean, if they didn't have blatantly horrible reputations, I'm sure it wouldn't be that way. But they do. I mean, me personally, I shoot my mouth off all the time because I don't really care. It's not an issue for me, but it might be for someone else. The words were originally used as curses which is why they're called curse words. Well not LITERALLY CURSES. But like ""curse you!"" Stuff like that. That and there's always the whole thing with the 'n' word. I honestly don't understand why black rappers think it's okay to just say that all the time. It's like urinating on themselves. Literally. If the word didn't have a history tethered to Africans being beaten brutally and forced to do manual labor I'm sure it would be fine to say all the time. Then again, it does have that history."	2
"But didn't you know? Jesus was a free market Capitalist!  I mean haven't you heard all those famous sayings of his?  ""Render unto Ceasar that which is caesars, unless he's trying to tax you then riot in the streets""? ""It is easy for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven... by riding on a Camel holding a needle""? ""Blessed are you who are rich, and comfortable, and well fed.. because wow, thou are doing great for thyselves and are very industrious workers!""? ""Sell your possessions at a hefty profit, and use the proceeds to buy thee a big fancy boat""? ""'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine was totally justified, bunch of lazy shiftless layabouts should go get a job if they don't like it! Etc...? Surely you have heard these well known teachings?"	Thanks for the laugh. On a serious note, why does it always seem to be the case that the most fervent Christians are also the most tied onto money? I'd love to know where that mutation in dogma came from.	2
Yeah, part of the reason it's so enticing is because it's made into such a taboo. If it were introduced and properly explained I doubt it would be so intriguing. Wait, you've never watched porn O_O	"actually i knew about it before I was introduced to it. ""Wait, you've never watched porn O_O"" why so surprised."	2
one of my most favorite shows. --------------------------------------------	"Yeah, you definitely do not want some chic talking about you to her friends and saying, ""He took it out."" unless she follows it with, ""Not there's anything wrong with that."" unless she says, ""It looked like a frightened turtle."" .... OK, I guess I watch too much Seinfeld ;)"	2
Yes to what you said about Adam and Eve.  If we are all sinners, then we will never stop sinning, and that would be infinite.	What I said about Adam and Eve was a statement. They ate the fruit, we were only born of them. Why are we sinners because they sinned was the only question. If we are sinners, that is because we sin. Yet in our lifetime we can only sin so much. There is a limit.	2
You have to get to know someone before you can seriously say you like them.  I do know that I am jealous of Andy because I wish I had bought this site. I probably couldn't have afforded it if I had known it was up for sale, but I am extremely curious how much he paid for it.	The site wasn't up for sale. I had a similar idea and knew that someone else likely did as well. I caught the developers/owners of the site at the right time and the rest is history!	2
Yes, but then you are kind of making Big Bang your God. You (atheist, not you personally) tell me, that I believe in magic. But do you see, how I feel just the same about your belief? I think it is pretty magical, that this beautiful world is made from .. big bang. What I mean is, that our beliefs are just as crazy.	"How can you believe the universe had to have had a beginning, but that God can be immortal and had no beginning? Atheists don't ""believe"" the universe started with the big bang, it's just the best theory anyone has come up with so far. The key difference between religion and science is that, if a scientist doesn't know something, he admits it, and then maybe tries to figure out an experiment to find out. If a religious person doesn't know something, he makes something up, and then defends to the death his right to believe it, and to make others believe it too."	2
"I've talked people who lived in the Ukraine, fought with resistance and had their entire village murdered. Since the Nazis hating a specif ""race"" (religion) make them worse? As if the USSR had nothing against Jews or Christians. The gulags were no better than Hitler's camps.  PS: Georgia and Ukraine are two separate places and maintain separate identities."	The Stalinists did some terrible things, but they were not as bad as the fascists. Some or the caps were the same, but it depends on which ones and which time period.	2
Interesting assessment... I kind of agree with this... the problem is no one can agree with what is wrong and what is right.	I would be content if people were atleast listen to their opponents perspective. they don't have to agree with it, but they should atleast try to respect it. Most users on createdebate are good people willing to listen, but there are a few who are extremely frustrating.	2
Also, gitmo is still open. ..	I heard that over a million served.... wait.... I may be thinking of McDonalds ;)	2
Wouldn't that make us all conservationists trying to conserve different things? Although I hope I'm not not conservative at all. The far left is just as bad as the far right.	I know, right ?	2
No, it means there is still HOPE!	Does this mean you're praying for me to change ?	2
Our bodies require intake of nutrients, true. But do we need to do it like that? Can't we just let the animal live a happy life, and when it's time to be killed and eaten, how about killing it with respect and painless? We might not be free from the bloodshed, but unlike all other species we actually HAVE equipments to kill a creature without pain.	I see your sentiments are quite quickly changed. Only two days ago were you insisting that animals oughtn't be killed? You, the self-described vegan, now betray your beliefs, saying instead that when it is killed it ought to be done so with respect and without pain. What brought about this change in spirit?	2
"I kept trying to upvote this but my computer acted like I pressed ""pg up"" every time, and scrolled up a bit instead of upvoting. Odd.  I like most of it but I could never buy into the idea of benevolent god; it's one of the main things that drove me from the Christian faith in the first place. You can talk about a good and just god all you like, but if you try to support that with any monotheistic dogma, you're not supported by scripture. The god I keep reading about, in other words, comes across as a deeply disturbed and cruelly vindictive god, more like one of the flawed and imperfect (but still immensely powerful) Greek gods. So I could never take the atheists wager because I think if there is a god, he will not judge me on my merits but on how my actions offended his delicate ego, and I'll fry for eternity because of it. This doesn't mean I don't like the first half of it, though."	I'm in total agreement with your views especially pertaining to benevolence. So I could never take the atheists wager  Me neither, I use it in juxtaposition to Pascal's wager to show another way (among the myriad of) in which the argument could be viewed.	2
"That's very true; some evidence indicates that Machiavelli actually preferred republics. And that, too, is a legitimate concern. Which is why I said in my blog, ""Shuddering at the memory of despotic monarchs in history such as King George III, many people wonder why Machiavelli even considers a monarchy."" But the question of the debate was, can it be a good form of government. Which I (and Machiavelli) would say 'yes' to."	it's not a good FORM. with the right guy, we can get lucky, but the form itself is not GOOD.	2
Is this the real life; is this just a fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.	easy come , easy go.	2

I may be wrong but I thought the Wiccan faith was about witchcraft. Maybe I am wrong but that's what I have heard.	It's a branch. You get witches who aren't Wiccans. But the definition of Wiccan is disputed all the time, it could be someone who follows the wiccan rede and practices withcraft, or someone who identifies themselves as wiccan. But there's loads of branches in Wicca. I don't believe in the threefold law so some Wiccans would say I'm not Wiccan.	2
Not only are school mandated drug test unnecessary, but the war on drugs is as well.	Explain...........................................................	2
Are you saying then, that since men tend to hold higher positions that this debates would actually be resolved in a different way, with most likely a different outcome? If that were the case, then I'd imagine that abortion wouldn't be so much up for debate, except by a few, and birth control would be paid for more easily.	Essentially, yes. Many men are happy are happy to stick to their (irrational) morals, as long as they aren't the ones who lose out from this. Make men the ones who would be restricting their own rights, and I'm quite confident that many would walk off of their perceived moral high ground. It would end up being a non issue.	2
Yes, it matters, and I think that the Supreme Court should definitely hear the case. But at the same time, I'm of the mind that saying a prayer at a town meeting does not come anywhere close to falling under 'law respecting the establishment of a religion.' I'm of the mind that banning prayer in government buildings, schools, et al is in fact infringing upon the rights of free speech and religious expression of all of those involved. Having to listen to somebody else praying in no way infringes on one's own rights. The case for banning prayer has no substance and no leg to stand on as far as I'm concerned, even if I'm not much for praying myself.	I don't want it banned in government buildings, but it shouldn't be part of official business. If they want to pray at work, they can do so durning lunch or breaks. The same goes for students at school. Prayer has no business being included in the curriculum. The fact that adherents of all faiths are given equal opportunity to waste time and money doesn't make it any better. I'd be equally opposed to a person exercising their right to freedom of expression by standing up and talking about their favourite sports team for two minutes every morning...and allowing other people to talk about a different sports team, or suggesting they leave until someone else is finished doing so if they don't want to listen to it, doesn't make it ok.	2
What do you pray about the most ?	Various types of things like thanking God for dying on the cross from our sins and rising from the grave, that we are alive and healthy, some of it is praising God and some personal things that some in my family need to work on and some stuff I need to work on.	2
No that's not what you claimed. That's what evolution claims to happen and they have computer generated possible family members, but no real fossils that are within the species of humans. My point is evolution up to animals works and fits in with the bible. The human evolution doesn't work. I believe that humans were created divenly because humans do not fit in the evolutionary tree or timeframe.	The bible says God made them. Biogenesis says they typically originated from a single celled common organism. That's it. The bible says God made them. Science says otherwise. Humans, by evolutionary studies, shows us the relation we have with all species which implies a common ancestor. We are even related to bacteria.	2

no they do not use kony as a reason for oil reserves in uganda. Where did you get that source?	it was on the news a long time ago. so i am suspecting the movement is being done to get support from the people. but the oil is a fact.	2
Snow? Okay, I guess. But cold? Well... okay, I guess. High humidity with all the previous coupled with a fucking wind? Fuck no! One minute outside with my bare hands and I can scrape the paint off the walls, without needing sandpaper!	Agreed. Snow is much better than cold. It's fun for kids (and adults, of course) to play with, and nice to look at, and it has cool properties for science geeks.  But cold? BORING! BAD! NO LIKE! REMOVE!	2
Nice Ad hominem. You said not to bother replying because you know you are wrong on this particular issue. All the knowledge you have on this issue you got from Michael Moore movies.	Iraq and Afghan is a war. Agreed. Only congress can declare war. Period. The last war declared by Congress was WWII. The Iraq and Afghanistan Wars was not a declaration of war by Congress, but a military engagements authorized by Congress. There is a difference. Bush however did a mighty fine job convincing Congress to authorize. Authorization by Congress to Bush. [1]	2
How can you conclude that Goku has more strength than superman? Just curious.	1. He can move much faster which means he can generate much more force behind his already powerful blows.  2. I've never seen superman punch someone through a mountain.	2
"""Its when Columbus discovered the new world which is the USA"" This is for most part true. ""if it wasn't for him to discover it then we would be in a different country and not free."" No thats not true at all, you can't say what would or wouldn't have happened had columbus not discovered the new world. One thing is for certain it would have still been discovered. Also, Columbus had nothing to do with freedom, he subjected the native populations to abominable treatment, he slaughtered thewm at will and used their livers to makes purses, and puches. He authorised the most barbaric treatment, and was responsible cruel punishment of the natives as he considered them animals and uncivilised. Not very Christian if you ask me. ""Thank You Jesus for Christopher Columbus "" Those two men existed in different time peridos, therefore they never came into contact with one another, therefore Jesus had nothing to do with Columbus discovering the new world."

14-year olds should not have the ability to drive due to many reasons. For one, the likelihood of a crash would be increased highly, as most 14-year olds are not very responsible. The laws are put there for our protection. If a 14-year old were to get a ticket from the police, or accidentally hit someone/something, it would be money coming from the parents/insurances pockets. The 14-year olds do not have steady jobs yet, so they would not be able to afford filling up, insurance and other costs. The last thing we need is casualties from car crashes involving an inexperienced 14-year old, whether the child kills someone else or is killed. This is a common-sense debate, the laws are here for a reason. Just because a few children may be responsible doesn't make it a good option to have.	I disagree with this i drove myself at 12 just down the street because my farther was teaching me how to drive as long as you know how to steer,you can push the peedle , and you can take directions it shouldn't be that hard. So yes 14 year olds should be able to drive. You just have to know what your doing. Yes ; every body recks even 30 year old , mature adults reck to.	2

We should... problem is the avatars are messed up... I don't even know what avatar you see for me? It's supposed to be ZombiePiratePOTUS with a cigarette... but I still see Smokey the Cat. Some people's avatars are different depending what device you use or where you are on CD. If you change your avatar you may not be able to change it back.	When I look at your avatar I see a Doobie Brother with a dash of Jack Sparrow and a splash of the Grateful Dead, LOL	2
Xbox 360 is better. It has a much better online community than PS3 does. It also has developed Kinect, an excellent motion sensing addition that allows you to play games similar to the Nintendo Wii.

I've noticed that responses like the above from theists always allow them never to concede the presence of flaws in their texts or doctrines, which makes me wonder whether the believer is playing an intentional game with the nontheist/skeptic, or whether their faith has brainwashed them to such an extent that they are genuinely incapable of seeing them. Either way, there's a problem.	In general, I agree completely, but Liber's one of the theists I respect most. He often criticizes Christianity and proofs for Christianity, evenhandedly (he openly attributes his own beliefs to irrational personal experience). And I agree with him, such an absolute claim needs absolute confirmation to be taken seriously, I would have taken the exact same position in his shoes.	2
I babysit for a gay couple. Two men. Their child is so well behaved. Gay parents aren't even that different. They have excellent parenting skills. I don't see why your preferred gender hinders you in your parenting skills.	I just have my personal views. That is all. Besides, I clarified that the ideal white picket fence heterosexual married couple is not always possible.	2
Is that an Asian who's also American? Or is that some new name for Americans someone made up somewhere? Anyway, I can locate my country, and most of the other famous ones. I just can't go so specific as to go into detail on all of the countries I know of, and where they are etc. One more thing though. Americans generally don't have to learn about maps. We learn basic knowledge of what one is, what they are used for, and how to use it, but we don't ever really need it since the likely hood of leaving the U.S. is low, and instead of learning all of this info about other countries and their locales we'll most likely have to know quite a few street names within the country already, making learning more than that useless and mentally taxing.	I say USAian because calling them Americans seems so politically incorrect to me. :/ I say estadounidense in Spanish.	2
"Niet tovarishch, I would understand if you didn't like him because you thought his theories were bad, but saying things like "" I bet his books make you sick"" because one was called Nausea ( which you knew nothing about) was just..

It is not illegal to kill someone out of self defense. As long as it is not taken to far or out of context. If an old man is running at you with his cane you do not have the right to shoot him. If he had a spiked mace you do have the right. If that man is in your house running at you with his cane ( as long as he has broken in ) you have the right to shoot him. I mean if what you are talking about is have a license to murder someone over a despute then that is not technically self defense. Self defense already is not illegal. It is murder that is illegal not murder in self defense. I do not think that YOU are stupid I just find that this debate to be rather on the incognizant side.	"You are dead wrong! It most certainly is not legal to kill someone simply because they broke into your home or anywhere else unless that person has a gun or other type of firearm! An old man coming at you with a cane, albeit a break in, does not constitute a reason to kill and you will be counting your jelly beans in prison for a very long time. Even if he came at you with a medieval spiked mace, it is your obligation to try and escape his thrusts unless no other means was available to you...and even then, logic tells me that escape is not that difficult. The rules and laws pertaining to self defense have either escaped you or you really didn't know what they were to begin with.  You seem to have a love affair with the word ""incognizant."" Over 50% of the time, you use the word improperly. Please look it up and use it in the context it should be used. Your argument on self defense indicates you are incognizant of its true meaning."	2
Iraq never should have been made a nation in the first place... I think we now know why Saddam had to be such a dick... it was the only way to keep the Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites from killing each other.	And after the war, which never should have happened, Iraq should have been split up, with the Sunni portion going to Syria, the Shiite portion going to Iran, and the Kurdish portion either given to Turkey, or setup as an independent nation.	2

I think both are called for but I would put an emphasis on rehabilitation. Punishment without rehabilitation, for criminals who are one day going to be out among the general populace again, seems counterproductive. Sadly, the recidivism rates for abusers who go through treatment is not that much lower than the rates for abusers who don't...so I suppose this is more of an idealistic response.	I fully support the point you are making because what many of us do not understand is the simple fact that domestic violence is a cycle that we have to break and inorder to break that cycle, we have to find out what the needs of these people are and then work to address those needs. Maybe they were victims of child abuse or neglect, maybe they were witnesses to one of their parents being a subject of domestic violence or maybe it even has to do with their cultural background. These are people, who if placed in prison, might be raped, infected with STDS/STIS (which pose a significant threat to their spouses or other halves upon release to society), or be influenced by prisonization. Furthermore, families will be broken apart and children will grow up hating their parent (s). Rehabilitation for these offenders will help them to address their issues, improve family relations and reduce the recividism rate as well, so in this case, i would say that rehabiliation is the proper method of treatment for these offenders.	2

"One of the definitions of religion is: Details of belief as taught or discussed. Believing in aliens falls into this category. ;) You could use this definition instead: The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power. But technologically advanced aliens can be considered to possess superhuman controlling power. And once that is established, someone, somewhere, would worship them. Which would make it a religion. ;) You can even extend the definition: The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods. But someone, somewhere, would reason that maybe these aliens are the ones that started life on Earth (as an experiment, maybe) and that would make them the God described in the bible. Which also qualifies as a religion. ;)  BTW, If aliens started life on Earth, a lot of things would fall into place. The God in the old testament is flawed with ""human"" emotions like jealousy (Though shall not worship any other God but me), which aliens would probably possess. And it would also explain why they don't answer prayers (they can't read our minds). And why they don't intervene (They probably don't visit often). But that's the topic of another debate ;)"	... Damn...you. LOL! This isn't over. I will think of an analogy to support my statement.	2
Yes, all political structures do lead to nepotism etc. So, how would you organize society?	Anarcho capitalism, rule of law is strictly common law provided by competing entities where it would adjudicate acts of violence, disputes, violation of contracts and protect property. Everything else would be market forces.	2
Amen. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. No one gets to the Father but by Him. Upvote.	I should make a youtube video about this and discuss it.  	2

It is horrible the way some people treat these poor animals - I really don't know what makes us any different from animals when I see a video like this. Have you watched earthlings? Terrible!!! I never wear fur, leather - I don't eat meat or dairy and I NEVER use beautyproducts, soaps and stuff like that that have been tested on animals. I don't wanna be a part of anything in that video, it is inhuman and it makes me wanna puke.	It isn't inhuman, it is perfectly human. We, as a species, are not created to exist free from the bloodshed of members of other species. Our bodies require the intake of various nutrients either only found or best found in the edibles of animals to function properly. It is your policy of refraining from engaging in this, your fellow earthlings' vice, that is inhuman.	2
Yes! You know, they should learn 2 when they are young. I think Sweden or Finland requires this. In a modern world, knowing other languages is key. I think every student should know Spanish, then a language of their choice.	You rock! I so agree. :)	2
Thank you for clarifying. So, which commandment says it is ok to burn witches at the stake?	Their was none. I know it was terrible. Theirs no denying this, I don't believe it to be right either. Sorta contradicts the love commandment. But where is this happenning today?	2

for all i can say from my tiny 21-year life experience, YES! i've had couple times when a good videogame or movie saved me from horrible thoughts and eventually i figured out and solved my problems. i had never ever been so vulnerable at those moments, and i got enough willpower to not start using drugs or alcohol or smokes. some people probably can handle themselves just fine, without any escapistic ways, but i bet there's few such people and i'd love to learn from them. As for tragic events, try to view it from a different perspective. kinda helped.

"Is he saying, ""Turn around, I'll give it to you?"" And what's with the grandparents in the band? And you made me watch till the end to see the transvestites?"	Lyrics: German love I will give it to you, give it to you, give it to you (She won't have a thing to do with me, to do with me She won't have a thing to do with me, a thing to do with me). The band appears in drag at the end. Why? My daughter explained it to me but I forget. It was the band's idea, and the old folk replacing them on stage as well. I know she wanted to do something different -- in fact they had agreed to her concept and at the last minute decided to do it like this. And I'm sorry. Next time we will try to get to the transvestites first thing.	2

Everyone deserves compassion. 	So what else do you do to show compassion? Do you volunteer at the homeless shelter, or the senior center, or help inner-city youths? Are you adopting children in need?

Students should complete studying because university or college certificate can give the person more opportunity of career so they will have a better future .	For sure Amna, students should complete their study after graduation, because they have to work to help the country to develop, and if the country had a good future absulotly the citizen will have a better on.	2
What about people like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, yes I know Alex is Lib but he's still a conservative Christian extremist? Rush runs the modern day Republican party, yes he does, maybe not by recognition but by default he does, what are your thoughts on people like him and the others I listed?	What about people like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, yes I know Alex is Lib but he's still a conservative Christian extremist? These are the type of people who vote based on the party, not by the individual. The Democrat's have them too.  Alex Jones will likely never be satisfied. He's just a conspiracy theorist. Rush runs the modern day Republican party, yes he does, maybe not by recognition but by default he does, what are your thoughts on people like him and the others I listed? Rush doesn't run anything other than a radio show.  History has shown us that if the previous president is a Democrat and he sucks... then we elect a Republican next, and vice versa. These people do not matter. They represent themselves.	2

Evidence is not proof, so that would be one way to believe in something without proof. Another is just from the perception you get by hearing people talking about something. I believe in global warming without having seen the evidence, because it seems reasonable based on what I've heard over the years.	True though I assume that evidence is implied to go along with proof here. Anyways I don't think overhearing people's thoughts on global warming is actually good reason to think something, unless they made good arguments which in that case you are justifying it with logic, which requires some sort of knowledge in majority of cases (A.K.A. proof or evidence.).	2
Many people use arguments of evolution describing humans as advanced animals and that the purpose of life is to reproduce. It is quite obvious that there are greater purposes in life than reproduction.  I agree that we should not blindly follow animal instincts. These instincts are often unhelpful though some are helpful. For example a mother's compassion for her children is instinctual and should be valued and developed however the tendency to physically harm those who anger you is not helpful and should be abandoned.	True but I don't just mean in small scale normal things, but as a society aswell. Marriage for example is definately human and not animal... written language - laws, religions etc. These things show a complex and human instincts.  However hierachys? alpha males and females? Groups/tribes/communities etc? Do they count as animal or human.. and should we keep them or eliminate them?	2
Yes but my example is a typical couple who ate both either for or deciding not to. Those are his cells in her body making up half that baby and bringing it to life. But I am only talking about what I have been for a while now.	"Yes but my example is a typical couple who ate both either for or deciding not to.  If that's the case, there's no debate. There's nothing for him to weigh in on, it's already decided that their opinion is mutual. Yet in the case of situations where mutualism is not the case, the choice should come down solely on the woman.  Those are his cells in her body making up half that baby and bringing it to life. Those are also her cells, or else the cells in him would have already made a baby, yet the work that needs to be done for the baby, is left up to her completely. Think about the story of <a href='http://www.storybus.org/stories_and_activities/the_little_red_hen/story'>""The Little Red hen"". Everybody wanted some of the hen's bread at the end yet no one did anything. (The man added his DNA, but the woman did as well so that kind of makes that act null). In the end of the story, the person who did the most work, enjoyed the bread all by herself, because being the only person doing anything she was perfectly entitled. No one felt like she was stingy, or greedy, or selfish for taking all of the finished product she made for herself."	2
No, I didn't say all that... Live your life the best way you can but there is no overall meaning to it.. Is there a meaning of life for a mosquito? No. But that mosquito should live his life to the fullest... zipping around and sucking blood from anything you can... Hell. maybe that is it's meaning of life? This shit is all very vague and can't be proven anyway.	I try to zip around and buzz people and all that. Am I living to the fullest ;)	2

What do you mean by marking territory? I don't get this debate.	Yeah, I ran out of space in the line, sorry.

Marking his territory with an engagement ring, shows that she's taken.	2
Cool so you're not mad then?	Of course not. The reaction is understandable. Realizing the type of society we live in.	2
It is true that we could fit the world's population in the state of Texas and it would have a population density about that of New York city (Not comfortably). However physical space is far from the only resource that people want or need. It is merely one item on a massive list. The more people there are, the more thinly certain resources are spread. The overabundance of people is taking it's toll on the environment in a number of serious ways. Not the least of which is driving other species to extinction by pushing into and disturbing ecosystems. The world's rainforests have been slashed down at an alarming rate, which itself causes other problems. Overpopulation also strains the world's supply of clean drinking water: <a href='http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2097159,00.html'>http://www.time.com/time/health/article/                                       0,8599,2097159,00.html  And we're already farming some 80% of arable land.	This whole argument should be a non-starter. There is a limit to just about everything. Look at many cities in China and India that are some of the most polluted places on earth. Even if every human was taught the most sustainable practices, their consumption, natural resource usage and waste has consequences.	2
Well then according to this would you agree that the art should be valued according to the amount of imagination and creative skill that was put into the piece?	No, how did you get that from that?

"""Cheating on a test? That is bad for a good reason. That means he's not learning and he's using other people's work without doing the work himself... Being gay has no negative."" Actually, being gay has many negative consequences... 60% of male homosexuals had more than 250 lifetime sexual partners... 28% had more than 1000 lifetime sexual partners.... and 79% admitted that more than half of their sexual partners were strangers (The Institution for Sex Research; Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). ""The average AIDS victim has had 60 different sexual partners in the past twelve months... the average heterosexual male has - throughout his life - from five to nine sex partners"" (Dr. William Foege, Director of the Centers for Disease Control). ""Yvonne Zipter, a lesbian writing in Chicago's gay journal Windy City Times, in an article entitled ""The Disposable Lesbian Relationship,"" notes that the ""lasting lesbian relationship"" is a ""mythic entity"" (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 147). The current figure is that 70% of Americans with  AIDS are male homosexuals or bisexuals. Dr. Bernard J. Klamecki, says that 86% of homosexual males use various drugs to enhance and increase their sexual stimulation. The homosexual is also 3 times more suicidal than heterosexuals. The life expectancy for gays wihtout AIDS is 33 years shorter than hetersexuals.... etc. (Understanding the Times student manuel pg. 148). The life style of gays is not a safe one.... I'm sorry, but you are wrong... ---------- And yes, I believe the Bible, so I follow the Bible. If God is real the He is the one to decide what is good and bad... not us!"	Yes, but if God is not real, then then we ARE the ones to decide what is good and bad. In fact, even if there was a god, why in the world would he be the god from the Bible? We already know the Bible is wrong. Genesis is wrong. If God lied about one thing, why would I believe anything else in it? If God had clearly stated exactly how the universe worked, along with quantum physics and Earth orbiting a star, if he had mentioned all the different galaxies and stars, if he had given us science regarding evolution or the Higgs Boson particle, then perhaps it would seem more authentic. Instead, the Bible is contradicted by modern science. Modern science is not wrong because it is based on evidence, not myths. Not to mention the Bible endorses slavery. If you feel gayness is worse than slavery, then you are truly corrupted.	2
Well... these scenarios are very.. cough I don't know. Any-who, I would save the child. Sure that means more people die, but they lived their life. Children are young and have so much they could do in the future. Besides, if I were the father, I don't know how I could go on knowing I practically killed my own child.	yes me too. I will choose the child. That would at least lessen the evil people in the world. But it would still be a difficult choice for me since killing people is something I wouldn't do unless it is necessary.	2

Many people find work much more important than higher studies as it provides them with an immediate income which ensures financial independence for them. But they tend to forget that this income remains very limited compared to what they may gain with a university degree in hand. those who pursue their studies at Higher education institutions are more likely to make wiser decisions about their future whether concerning professional careers or personal life. they have better chances for more well paid jobs, more developed relationships and more open- minded view of the whole world.

Fair enough. I tend to run skeptic. I am surprised that I am a theist. If you were to believe in a god, which would it be?	I too am baffled at how you've remained a theist. I personally think that religion is so ingrained in you that your mind is finding it impossible to let it go. Reguardless it's always good to be skeptical in any context. The answer to your question is simple, which ever god had ample evidence to support its existence beyond a reasonable doubt I would be compelled to believe in it. Personal bias wouldn't play a role. I don't care if it happened to be Yaweh or Baal or the Wiccan godess or some rain god from the Incan people. Evidence is all I need.	2
"Your science did not create Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional herbal medicine and yoga. Why not? Modern science, no. But a form of the scientific method, I think yes.  How else did the person who created Tai Chi learn of it? Through trial and error of course. He figured out what worked, and what did not work, and continuously refined the practice.  Qi Gong  is a practice of aligning breath, movement, and awareness for exercise, healing, and meditation. Again, how did they learn how to align their breath, adjust their movements, and awareness without trial and error? Some form of the scientific method lead them to discover Qi Gong as well.  Traditional Herbal Medicine is the same thing. Perhaps someone was cooking some type of dish and decided to throw a certain herb into the dish, and discovered the medicinal properties of the herb and then began experimenting with different herbs from that point on.  Yoga is the same as Qi Gong and Tai Chi. Someone had to refine the technique, try new things, and learn more once they discovered the tip of the iceberg known as Yoga.  I dont suppose you can explain 'chi', inner energy do you? Care to explain what it is exactly so I can attempt to answer your question? I may make this sound funny but it is to show you the limitations of scientific explanation. None of the things you listed are outside of the ""limitations"" of scientific explanation."	Oops, old habit. I keep assuming modern science as an ideology rather than a method of getting things done or scientific method. So yes, I meant mainstream science. Yoga greatly differs from Qi Gong and Tai Chi in terms of cultural origins and philosophy. But breathing techniques are some of the common elements. Traditional herbal medicine early revolves on certain roots of plants and it involves superstition which turned out true. Qi or Chi is a kind of spiritual energy located at the abdomen and it regulates to 7 gates in the body or 7 chakras. This affects self-esteem, 'luck' and much more. This is just a brief explanation but topic is deep. Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism have their different ways of looking at it and has been proven true via effects even if their explanation are not supported by mainstream science. The science of Third Eye can not be validated by mainstream science.	2

Haha... kinda funny. First, you can't unwillingly be converted to any religion if you don't want to be. That's just common sense. Secondly I would say that it doesn't violate any separation of church and state. I would only hope that if another, non christian group, asked for the same favor it would be extended to them.	You got my vote on that. As long as you are not being intimidated by them, no reason why you should feel offended.	2
Oh and you can speak for all girls can you? I can speak for non-fictional girls. The girls you are talking about come from movies, real girls actutally don't talk about their period.  Can you dispute me and say that no girl does that?  No.. but that weren't exactly my words. I said ''girls don't do that'', which was a generalization. Generally, girls don't do that. I maybe should have added that. Of course I can't say that no girls do that. it has always been evident it was 'that time of the month'  Are you sure? I mean try to take into consideration, that this happens every fourth week. EVERY fourth week, take into consideration how often that is, and then take into consideration how many women you meet. If you think of it - every fourth woman you meet, should be on her period. Is it ALWAYS evident that she is? I bet that you heard from one or two women that they were on their period and after that ''you always know''. because they're always rude to people I would disagree, that is also fictional. What proof have you that no girl bitches about their period? First off - I never really said ''no girl'' .. but whatever. I am one, I live with 5, I have tons of girl friends, I talk to them everyday, and since I talk to them everyday, I rarely know when or if they are on their period, which should prove that they don't always bitch about their period, I have periods myself, and it is no big deal .. it is just something that comes every month, like payment.. you don't see people bitching about their payment EVERY MONTH, do you? People bitch about their payment sometimes, when the discussion starts.	"You're right I should have clarified, bitchy to guys. And yes it is evident, I mean my ex wouldn't shut up about it. One week she's fine the next "" Andrew don't fucking joke with me I'm NOT IN THE MOOD.""  I mean where else would that come from, on a monthly basis. I mean It's possible a member of her family dies every month, but.... And that's one example. And besides, you expect that guys would be bitchy if they bled outta their dicks every month, you say it as though you're saying "" Guys complain that girls are bitchy, but wouldn't men be as well"" as if to say "" Girls are bitchy, but guys would be as well."" I would relate. Fortunately I do not have to..! So you have in your wording told us already that you think girls are bitchy on their period.   Don't become a lawyer."	2
"If that's the kind of thing someone wants to watch more power to them, some ""chick flicks"" can be pretty good. Why do you keep posting these kind of debates?

"Neither. Only time and knowledge perceived as coming from self can open a closed mind. When I make fun bigotry it is as effective to the individual as when I or you explain it rationally, that is to say it is not. What treating it as valid, whether you believe it to be valid or not, does to is lend unearned authority to the opinion in question.  If someone were to ask me the question posted as in the title without this particular text to follow, I'd be more than happy to explain it similar to how it was explained prior to that last paragraph.  However, when someone assumes ""moral"" superiority in such a manner that it is obvious they've no intention of actually asking a question and only wish to preach, I reserve the right to make fun of them. I will stop making fun of anti-gay sentiment framed from a moral superior soap box on the day anti-gay individuals cease their relentless pursuit of discrimination. As it stands, asking whether this person is a small child is hardly equivalent to actively protesting the rights in real life of tens or hundreds of thousands of people."	As it stands, asking whether this person is a small child is hardly equivalent to actively protesting the rights in real life of tens or hundreds of thousands of people. A child's opinion has no say, or power, in the outcome of the rights of real life hundreds of thousands of people. You approach is better suited for the politicians that do have a say in, and power over, the rights of said people. I guess my question to you would be, if you were in front of a crowd of people (young and old), would you feel comfortable addressing a child that way?	2
That's something we can agree on. Certainly a god worth worshiping wouldn't have committed the atrocities he's famous for written in the bible, yet he has. Only answer, is fabrication in the telling of these stories. Yet if the bible is all you have to go on for your god, and you already know it is wrong, why believe in him, with no accurate description of his feats? Why fear god, if you don't know honestly how mighty he is? Why worship him, if you don't know honestly how benevolent he is? My answer to these questions, are simply don't.	It's obvious as to what God's image should be. The one who will smite thee if yee decides not to follow he.	2
"The old "" would you steal to feed your family"" queston. From the perspective of the thief, he sees himself as justified. From the perspective of the baker, he see the thief as hurting his own ability to feed his family."	Moral questions cannot be proven or disproven, they are essentially feelings. So, my apologies, I still don't see how perspective apart from logic, evidence, or proof justifies a belief or helps us determine right in the meaning of fact or correct.	2
"Then you misunderstood completely. With that I did not say that time exists. With that all I said was how we see ""time"", how we interpret it. In reality it does not exist as a part of our universe, as some ""force"". It is simply the effect of the structure of our universe. Without the things making the effect possible there would be no such thing."	"I guess it comes down to ""intellectual semantics"". Sure time is not a force but to me that does not mean ""what is happening"" does not exist. If you think of time as ""order"" (in other words the big bang happened ""before"" the earth formed) than I think time as a concept exists. Obviously without humans around to put the label on it ""time"" does not exist. So, maybe it's just the semantics."	2

That is true. I think the chances of a new Hitler rising to power are pretty slim, because since WWII we have become so much more aware of the danger of allowing democracy and human rights to be eroded. Even minor (relatively speaking) human rights abuses by Western powers draw frenzied criticism. But then, I don't suppose many people in the early 20th century had predicted Hitler's rise and actions. A regional Hitler oppressing a particular nation I can easily imagine though - in fact you can argue it's happening right now, in regards to women's rights and gay rights in some Middle Eastern countries.	"Yes. Though, we'll never know will we? There's always the chance a very charismatic person could convince an idiotic government official that homophobia, womens rights, or anything else is potentially threatening a so-called ""perfect"" society. I do believe that we should try to stop that before it can get very far, but of course, the United States does not ike to interfere untill too late."	2

I have never been limited by word that someone used against me. I've been kicked around a bit, and that was just for training. So I'm used to physical abuse as well, but still, if someone breaks my arm I will not be able to use that arm. If someone calls me a faggot, I will still be able to function properly.  The effectiveness of a word rests solely on the person receiving the verbal assault. If they let it hurt them, it will hurt them, if they don't, it won't. Not like getting your arm broken, which will still result in a broken arm whether you accept it or not.

My point is evolution up to animals works and fits in with the bible. The human evolution doesn't work. I believe that humans were created divenly because humans do not fit in the evolutionary tree or timeframe.	2
i dint know how to identify a doughnut from bagel...but going for doughnut as my free coupon would say:'buy a doughnut and get a bagel free'.	Bagels more commonly come cut if half.

As opposed to a bagel that is usually not covered, but on the rare chance it is, it's covered in something not sweet.

"What ""scientists"" are you hearing from??? I'm calling 'Bullshit'. ;)"	Sorry I didn't mean for it to sound so blakc and white like the theory of the Bing Bang. <a href='http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/why-do-we-dream.html'>We may dream to de-clutter our brains. Every day we are bombarded with new information, both consciously (eg learning) and unconsciously (eg advertising). This modern dream theory suggests dreaming is a way to file away key information and discard meaningless data. It helps keep our brains organized and optimizes our learning. This theory hasn't been proven by dream research. If it were 100% correct, our entire day would be replayed to us during our REM sleep! Critics of this theory also point out that our brains are not the same as computers, and to draw a comparison to filing, processing and storage space is likely to be inaccurate. They also point out that although some of our dreams relate back to the waking day (Freud called this day residue), the majority of our dreams are not about real events.	2
Disregard all of that longer post. I can't believe so many, or any person for that matter, couldn't locate their country...on a map of their country.

I guess it depends on the level of maturity in the case of words and it depends on the age in the case of broken bones.

Now, are you going to agree with me too ;)	no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no......yes.........NO !	2
Thoughts on Exodus 20:20-21. Congrads, you found a verse that involves harming a slave. However let's take a quick look at what this context is. Slavery was first of all not supported by God. God established humane limits on an already evil and cruel system. The Hebrews were already knowledgeable of what it felt to bein slavery. Along with this, the slave owners were told by God to treat their slaves fairly and with respect. They were given a day of rest (Ex. 20:10). They were to encouraged to attend religious services (DT. 12:12,18;16:11). Israelites slaves were to be treated with extra benevolence, being freed after 6 years (Ex. 21:2; DT. 15:12) or in the Year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:40-41). Female slaves who become wives to their owners were to be given all respect as a normal wife (Ex. 21:8-11). When a term of.slavery ended the slave had to be a gift (DT. 15:13-14). If a slave receives excessive physical abuse they are granted freedom (Ex. 21:26-27) and is considered a crime. Through these measures we see moses, by God, meant slaves were human beings and granted rights by their creator. So in context I believe the allowed physical abuse is like that of disciplining a child and yes I say and agree this is fair. I will comment on the others later.	"Slavery was first of all not supported by God. In Leviticus 25:44-46 god says, ""Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly."" If god doesn't support slavery why did he tell people ""you may buy slaves"" and that they are ""property"" that you can pass down to your children, and that you can make them ""slaves for life"" as long as they are not Israelites? The rules he instituted for slavery only applied to Israelites. God established humane limits on an already evil and cruel system. How about instead of establishing humane limits he tells them to stop making people slaves. It's funny how god has no problem telling people silly things like don't wear mixed fabrics and don't eat shellfish but he doesn't seem to think that slavery is a very important issue. He tells people that the punishment for picking up sticks on the sabbath is death, the punishment for not being a virgin is death, the punishment for cursing at your parents is death, but there is no punishment for owning slaves or beathing your slaves as long as they survive the beating. Doesn't that strike you as a little odd? They were given a day of rest (Ex. 20:10). This wasn't for the benefit of the slave. It was because god considers work on the sabbath unholy and anyone found working on the sabbath was to be put to death. Even if it were for the benefit of the slave does it really make a difference. Is slavery somehow not so bad since they are allowed to rest one day a week? They were to encouraged to attend religious services (DT. 12:12,18;16:11). So not only were they forced into slavery but they also had to grovel to the god who said it was okay for them to be made into slaves in the first place. Why didn't these religious services include the message ""don't own slaves"" instead of ""make sure your slaves attend church with you."" Israelites slaves were to be treated with extra benevolence, being freed after 6 years (Ex. 21:2; DT. 15:12) or in the Year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:40-41). Yes, god plays favorites with the Israelites, which in itself isn't fair, but if you're not an Israelites or are female then it sucks to be you because you can be made a slave for life. Female slaves who become wives to their owners were to be given all respect as a normal wife (Ex. 21:8-11). How come you skipped verse 7? ""If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do."" Why would a benevolent god say it's okay to sell your daugthers as a slave and say that she can be made into a lifetime slave, unlike males who are set free after 6 years? So not only is god okay with slavery, he's also sexist. When a term of slavery ended the slave had to be a gift (DT. 15:13-14). Only for Israelites. All others are slaves for life. If a slave receives excessive physical abuse they are granted freedom (Ex. 21:26-27) and is considered a crime.  Only if they lose an eye or a tooth during the beating and are Hebrew.  Through these measures we see moses, by God, meant slaves were human beings and granted rights by their creator. Again, only for Israelites. Since you used Moses for your example, lets see what else he has to say about slavery. Deuteronomy 20: 10-15 ""When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby."" So not only are people forced into slavery by gods chosen people, the women are considered plunder. So in context I believe the allowed physical abuse is like that of disciplining a child and yes I day and agree this is fair. This isn't just a minor discipline like a spanking a child. It says, “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."" It doesn't say beat them gently like disciplining a child. It says as long as they survive the beating there is nothing wrong with it. It even mentions a rod and recovery time. Do you think something as minor as disciplining a child takes a day or two to recover from?  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFmC6BD1B4'>This video shows just how ridiculous the Biblical god is when it comes to slavery."	2

Incorrect. Quocalimar did not agree with you. Your argument was that an atheist only need not believe in God (the Christian deity). Quocalimar said any god (any deity). If you believe in any deity, you are a theist. If you do not believe in any deity, you are an atheist.	a·the·ism  /ˈāTHēˌizəm/ Noun The theory or belief that God does not exist. Hence, if I believe Cronos created the world, and god is something the whiteman created, then I am an Atheist.	2
So God can do what he wants, because he is God, and it is correct? Surely that leads to the idea that it is good for us to do such a thing also? Either it is good or it is bad, it must be true for all people, and such an action being good would contradict other statements on morality. And, it's violated by the Euthypro Dilemma. The only escape route I could think of was the idea that Isaac wouldn't have known his own devotion unless challenged in such a way, and by God's actions, he was benefited overall. Seems very much to be clutching at straws though, as he was pretty committed to begin with in the story.	I actually posted a link to this on facebook, and someone did clutch at straws. The problem with it though is that the lesser evil type of argument contradicts god's properties as well.	2
I hear he has A.D.D.	Ah I see what you did there! ;)  	2
PCP should never be legalized because the government must protect those who are unwilling and irresponsible of making their own decisions. The Government must have a paternalistic role in controlling the availability of drugs and those innocent victims killed every year from drug use.  Without the role of government, availability of drugs would become wild, and everyone would become high, and it would be the end of civilization and the economy. Our economy would solely be based on drugs and addiction. There would be no need for anything else.	Was that really so hard?	2
Show off. :P	Lol oops.	2

I don't have to show you an instance where I have won, I know it is possible. And who cares if I have won an argument, that doesn't mean that no one can win. What's your point any way?	My point is: Head-on attempts to persuade can sometimes trigger a backfire effect, where people not only fail to change their minds when confronted with the facts—they may hold their wrong views more tenaciously than ever.  I see this happening all the time on CD ;)	2
you try living such a miserable life that you hate so much that you want to die and see what you do about it. No one should be forced to suffer.	Oh no I agree no one should be put through a bad life I think people should have the right to take their own life, that's why I'm for assisted death because I think people should be given the choice cowardly or not. I only say it can be seen as cowardly because it's the easy way out, that is the only reason.	2
I'm disputing mostly to spur conversation, but also because the point wasn't about the importance of cash or credit, it was about buying more in general. The credit aspect was added so that people wouldn't throw up the Great Depression example where everything was bought on credit. I also agree that credit is bad long term.	"I see.  Taking credit out of the equation, spending is helpful to any economy in terms of overall quality of life and in terms of advancement.  It's sort of self-evident I think, but when most people are spending less individually there is less incentive to create, thus less need to employ, thus less people with money, thus less spending, thus less incentive to create... and on and on. With more spending the opposite is true, again, most reasonable people can see this is the case without much explanation. The problem is when the complexity of how money is spent, and where that money is really coming from is overlooked. It is complex. This also requires massive action. A few spending money is not helpful (unless wealth is incredibly concentrated, <a href='http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/financial-wealth-united-states.png'>which we're definitely trending toward and even then, a limited number of people buying does not create incentive for massive job creation).  There is a recent example of this in the Bush tax cuts. It resulted in approximately $100 real extra money for the vast majority of people, then at the upper ends $100,000 plus. This did not ""save the economy"" obviously because that $100 was a small portion of indebted money (on average people still owed more than $100) for the masses who ideally would have been required to spend to begin this process, and at the top end, there was no incentive to invest that money in anything that created jobs, because the masses still don't actually have money to spend. Worse, the vast majority of that cut still makes its way to those who received the lion's share of that tax cut in the form of paying of debts and interest, it just took a little longer to get there than with the straight tax cut received.  So spending is good, even necessary, but only when you actually have the money to spend, and when it can be spent in addition to other things already bought. It does not work if it is swallowed by paying more for things people already have or already need to spend on because that eliminates the incentive to ""create."""	2
Yep, it was a beach house at Blackpoint, CT. There was a razor thin line separating two sections of panels, and was barely noticeable, but we pulled them away and there was a small room behind it.	Did you already know there was a secret room and you went looking for it, or did you discover it completely on your own?	2
"You certainly have a point there. I would maybe argue that ""heartless"" is a bit extreme, but I absolutely do not approve of people who really do use such things to promote themselves."	Well I do believe it requires at least the slightest amount of heartlessness to bring up another issue, if only for it being advantageous; or even yet invasive to those mourning I'd only imagine.	2
I had to chose this side because there were certain drugs on your list that I don't think should be legalized. Heroin, morphine, etc. are highly addictive drugs. Although I don't care what other people do, I want to make sure that there are some barriers in place to try and protect my daughters from their bad judgment. What I teach them may not be enough and I want something in place to help me keep them away from drugs.	"I said, up above, that I didn't want this to become a fight over legality. I see too much of that on the internets, and it doesn't get anyone anywhere. This is about whether or not drug use has moral implications.  So then essentially what you are saying is that you don't want heroin and the likes to be available because no one can explain addiction in a way that would keep people from doing it if it were available?   How though is this a good thing to do? You're looking out for your children, sure, I get that part, but how can you say because of your children, and their lack of understanding, drugs cannot be used by anyone... What about the people that understand addiction and what the drugs do to you physically and they agree to go somewhere where they will not hurt anyone or increase the likelihood of hurting themselves. How can you tell them that they shouldn't still? ""You, bob, cannot have heroin because 15 years ago, I had a daughter!!!""  :P"	2
Okay, then why don't I have the right to go kill someone who pisses me off?	Because you would be taking away their right to choose .	2
Yes, they should be separate but not outrageous. I was at one Saturday past created by www.gaypartypackages.com a new company catering to gay parties. Excellent. We had a very upscale sit down dinner for 8 with a hot server and then naughty sketch comedy in the living room with more wine and dessert. This is the first service I know that specializes in gay parties and they are good.	No (male) stripers? ;)	2
Thanks for taking me up on the offer.  Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) This is completely understandable, however if you pick up any study Bible, you will find this is a declarative statement only. God didn't create the sun, moon, stars, or planets on that day, he simply called the appearance of the sun day, and the appearance or visibility of of the moon night. This is because the clouds or earths atmosphere cleared allowing for you to see the sun and moon from the earth. Jesus Look up celcus (spelling may be wrong, sirry its off the top of me head, he was Egyptian I think) the historian who commented pn Jesus's miracles. The only way he could discredit them is say they were sorcery. If Jesus's miracles were legit (not just getting people high to make it seem like it, yes I've heard that one but how did he get 10,000+ high at once at the feeding of the 5,000 (men)) who else was he?	Earth did not exist before the sun. (Neither did plants) False. Genesis clearly states God separated day from night, then created the sun and moon.	2
Yes, it was pretty terrible (what happened not the book). Btw, if you feed bacon to a pig, is it technically cannibalism?	I guess. They probably wouldn't know it was pig though.	2
That's laughable.	The author is highly pissed ;)	2
In my school, you owned the identity of being a nerd. I consider myself a nerd, and i was welcomed at the jock table.	What? How old are you? I guess times have changed.	2
Well I can, but which of my arguments would you like me to go into more specifically?	That is should have happened a while ago. I am more of a futurist.	2
What advice did I give?	No honey, I was talk to the other person. Sorry for the mixup. .	2
Even so, it wouldn't die. We are more likely to go extinct now than we were 20 000 years ago. You are more likely to die though. Money is a medium of exchange, get rid of it, and the economy collapses and if your not near a farm and have something the farmer wants to trade, well guess what, your going to die. Most city dwellers (which make u a large percentage of the population) fir that category,	"You are right in saying I don't provide a point for a money-free society in the conditions and in the scale that we face today. I am merely implying that a money-less system was the one in which we evolved to have much of our feelings of morality. We need a much deeper inquiry into human nature before we can have a moral ""knockout argument"" for one system, that's all."	2
Until recently I would have posted on the other side but my most recent interactions with Christians has made me doubt their motives sadly recently I have found them to be hypocritical, Homophobic and Exenophobic. I hope this isn't the majority and that I have been dealing with a vocifourous minority. As it stands I do not trust any organised religion I think their all as bad or good as each other and will continue with my own journey to enlightenment.	The obnoxious ones are always louder, and generally put more effort into being noticed. Christians who don't have a problem with homosexuality, for example, don't generally feel the need to go online and rant about how okay with homosexuality they are. No, we usually end up hearing from the ones who have beef, unfortunately, and I can hardly blame you for doubting Christians as a group on those grounds.	2
The firmament is earth's atmosphere!  The first plants evolved in the Ordovician Period. At the beginning of the period, around 485.4 ± 1.9 million years ago, the climate was very hot due to high levels of CO2, which gave a strong greenhouse effect. The marine waters are assumed to have been around 45°C (113°F), which restricted the diversification of complex multi-cellular organisms. But over time, the climate become cooler, and around 460 million years ago, the ocean temperatures became comparable to those of present day equatorial waters. -Wikipedia So the plants evolved in the gaseous CO2 atmosphere, the sky being opaque. The waters were to hot to form multi-celluar, but the ground could form plants due to high levels of CO2. Once again, lines up with the Bible.	Then you are disproving yourself. This would start the rise of humans.	2
Well, I haven't had either... or at least I hope I haven't had either?	Ed Gein was known for giving his neighbors meat. They thought he got the meat when he went hunting. That may have been true, but he was hunting human. In other words, if you've a middle aged, slightly retarded, sexually repressed neighbor who offers you any kind of meat, you may end up wishing is was dog or cat.	2
I told my kids about sex early on.  A children's book explaining sex in fairly explicit detail, $10. Hot dogs and tacos for lunch for all of us, $20. The look on their little faces, priceless. I think they're still grossed out ;)	I feel like learning about sex from you would be one of the highlights of my scarred childhood X)	2
The last time I went to a Pizza Hut, the service was lousy and the food never arrived, so until I hear anything bad about these guys, I'm sticking with them	i think they are only in missouri but im not sure but there delicious	2
So, which aspect of classroom teaching do you think must be taken into consideration? Use of a particular strategy (eg DRTA etc), use of group work etc?	I think it boils down to the lesson objectives and following that, the various strategies employed and resources used. Basically, materials must support the lesson objectives and guide the process towards meeting those objectives, whichever strategies may be used.	2
I live in Wisconsin and I can say firsthand how mad some liberals were after both the first election and recall election.  At the same time though, Walker has done an exceptional <a href='http://walker.wi.gov/Default.aspx?Page=0ffa30be-db1d-4c35-a267-9ac7cf76892a'>job in office, and even liberals are starting to shut up.	"According to the lib that wrote the article, ""By any metric, Gov. Walker’s tenure in the statehouse has been a disastrous and divisive few years for Wisconsin, near the bottom in job creation and with a host of other problems the Charlie Brown-ish Walker has done little to solve and much to exacerbate."" ;)"	2
Nicole's right, plus it kind of already is, unless we choose for it not to be. Like, my name is my name, and yours Jake, plus we have our pick, and I have links and everything else. But we don't have all that. I could name myself like 1234567 and have a picture of a question mark as my avatar, then it would be anonymous I guess.	"Well, I do that. But at least you know that I am always Pineapple. I am consistently Pineapple, and you know my opinions and can hold me accountable for them across the board. It's that integrity that makes the difference between calling yourself ""1234567"" and being anonymous."	2
"1. Fiscally liberal means, as I stated before, wanting more government role and control over the economy.  2. Hitler was a socialist and nationalized a large portion of the German economy. That is not wanting ""little control"""	HITLER WAS A RIGHT-WING FASCIST ANY HISTORIAN KNOWS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
"She is in to big oil (again, another ""oily"" politician), she is in to micro-managing people's beliefs (what books to read, how the world was created), she loves ""nature"" and hunting (but hopefully aims better than Dickie) but thinks nothing of destroying animal habitats and carving up pristine areas; as Mayor, increased the public debt and misdirected public funds to a sports complex over upgrading sewage systems and roads ...Shhh...she also raised taxes!  Cheney is, however, better traveled (on our nickel - oh yes, and Haliburton's.) How many times has Palin been out of the country? Interacted with foreigners or leaders from other countries? (An ""up close and personal"" between and her and Putin is an absolutely terrifying thought...) If elected, how many wars will her inexperience get us into?   Maverick? I think not. The word for Palin is Hypocrit. Or self-interested. Or crummy Mom. But maverick? Heck no!"	"Although I do not believe that Sarah Palin is in any way a ""Maverick"" I also cannot subscribe to your description of her as Cheney in drag! Palin hasn't an iota of experience compared to Cheney and that's no compliment to Dick Cheney since I loathe the man. I also do not believe she is a hypocrite and I cannot say she's a crummy Mom. I believe Sarah Palin is an opportunist. She governs the largest state in the nation with the fewest people in it. I believe the population of Alaska is under 900,000 people. I think she is a self absorbed and egotistical creature who takes credit for things she hasn't done or was a small part of. She speaks about the Alaskan Pipeline as though it hasn't been lying about the ""boroughs"" for the last 30 years and that when the last piece of pipe is set (probably while she was at the convention!) and the big blue wheel that says ""ON"" has been turned, with all due hoopla and a clown, America's energy crisis will be solved. The fact of the matter is that the pipeline won't be set to go for at least ten years and when it does flow, it will only give us a small percentage of what we need in oil or natural gas! Her pipeline is a pipe-dream!!! She has no infra-structure to speak of outside of the Alaska Highway. Even ""The Bridge to Nowhere"" went exactly there...nowhere. Alaska is not exactly rich in industry either and only has three to speak of. The oil fields, fishing and tourism and Alaska has a million and a half more tourists than residents. Those who cannot work in those industries work at Government jobs! What it is rich in is natural beauty. That it has in abundance. Alaska has the reputation of having better educated people due to Government jobs and making more yearly than some. They have no income tax and no state sales tax! She is also under scrutiny for several incidents involving per diem requests while working at home and the dismissal of a State Trooper who used to be her sister's boyfriend as well as other spending done at the cost of taxpayer's money. It will all come out in the wash...I just hope it spins fairly even if I don't like her. Somehow she doesn't add up to White House material for me and I believe Obama & Biden will rebound from the recent surge in popularity of McCain - Palin."	2
What? Why Slytherin? I'm more likely to be a Hufflepuff, I thiink. .-.	Oh, no. You're certainly Slytherin. You don't get to pick anyway, it's up to the sorting hat :p	2
If you don't want to take the topic seriously and be polite please don't post. Wait? So you don't want to hear my opinion?	Hellno, I'd rather read it .	2
I tend to stick with the discussion until I get an actual argument from people. It is like pulling teeth, but I am willing to try. That, or it isn't my debate so I don't have the power to ban.	I gotcha. .	2
I heard that in Liberia there was a General Mosquito. He was overthrown by General Mosquito-Spray.	Ha! Well, at least a mosquito has the potential to give you malaria. What's General Sissy going to do?	2
The implication being that American debates regarding atheism/theism are not genuine debates? Why the hell not?	I haven't noticed any differences between american and continental debates about theism.	2
So, in the end, that is still helping me with MY OWN problems. Either way, it's all selfish somehow. Fix up the world so I can benefit.  That is progress.	That's what's called cynicism, and I am not fan of it. There are such things as selfless acts...not everyone has an ulterior motive.	2
you do not understand because you are not a Liberal Politician that needs those votes !	Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! No doubt about that... I think I just said something similar in a reply to you below...	2
"Yes, a rally filled with people who are smoking it is going to add to negative perceptions of the drug. On the other hand, if people could come together respectably, without the tie-dye and the weed, and protest the law, then we might have a shot. But the problem, as pointed out by Wishnia, is that this type of political rally doesn't draw a crowd the way a festival-centered one does. People come out more as ""pot-pride"" than to stand up for our rights.  It's unfair to blame those who are prejudiced against the drug for their prejudice. It clearly lies with the nation's propaganda attempts over the last century. People who have been convinced by lies and propaganda are not at fault for anything except their own ignorance of which they are unaware. If we're going to assign additional blame, it belongs with the media for not calling attention to the hypocrisy of alcohol/marijuana laws, especially in the face of countless studies (some funded by the federal government) which verify the facts.  The only other place to put blame, then, is on the people who have not been taken into the propaganda, who enjoy to smoke, but fail to do anything about it. Part of the problem here is that some stoners don't accept or admit to the facts. The fact is there are SOME harmful consequences from smoking weed. But the harmful consequences from maryjane are minimal compared to other legal drugs.  If stoners could admit the truth about the drug we love AND stand up to say it is wrong to make laws against our cognitive liberty in a way that is respectable, then we MIGHT have a shot."	You know what, you're right. I'm sorry, but I can't keep disagreeing with you. It's totally against protocol, but I'm actually going to recognize that the other side might not be made up of a bunch of retarded monkeys (this is sarcasm, not belligerence). You are absolutely right. I still believe that the fact is, the propaganda and the like is the root cause and it must be eliminated for there to be real change, but you're spot on in saying that those that haven't been corrupted need to take a stand. And while I want to believe there are enough smokers out there that can stay sober long enough to make a distance, the fact is there needs to be more. Stoner apathy is not ubiquitous and it's not the sole cause of the lack of legalization, but it's a problem that if solved could perhaps be a catalyst for change.	2
Said by me, look at the time on this: I imagined you there dribbling with a stupid grin on your face. Stupidity to that extend angers me :L I mean I know you're not stupid, just you were acting very stupid in that debate, about existentialism... 1hr 44mins ago | Side: Nothing Now look at the time on this, said by you: obody cares who you are upset about. You don't even care. You said that I didn't like you because of that debate. You didn't say anything about yourself not liking me because even you realize no one cares who you don't like. :) 3hrs 59mins ago | Side: This... Support | Dispute | Clarify | Report YOU SAID IT FIRST GODDAMNIT.	I agreed: I said what I said before you said what you said, but you were talking about how you felt in the past about me. So, you were mean to me when you viewed me as dribbling a while back before I said what I said. So, you were mean first because you viewed me that way before even though I said the insult first. When you use the word imagined it refers to the past, so you insulted me with your imagination before I attacked you.	2
Yeah! His parants didn't even basic maners how then do we trust him to lead are nation?	There's nude pics of his mom on-line... don't bother, it's not worth it. LOL	2
Wedwjednjwdw and all his buddies :P  Seriously show me one person who likes him, besides his schizophrenic alter-ego's...	I agree those guys are so fricking annoying! Their arguments don't even make sense and they just do stuff like YOLO!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.	2
"First off, I could care less how many ""reward points "" I have. Secondly, I read the original article before, and I still think that the original OP is a silly question."	You know, I was seriously wondering how it was possible for you not to have any points and then it occured to me, you lose points every time you down vote. This rule was put into place because people here hate down voters..., so your down voting isn't buying you any friends. Well..., except for me. I don't down vote or make people my enemy just because I disagree with them ;)	2
So you're saying Christians believe that the events in the old testament are bullshit lies?	Lol, no you stupid idiot. When did I ever say that? Christian beliefs are based on the new testament. Christian beliefs are based on, that Jesus came down to earth to save us from Hell (just to clarify, I don't believe in hell) This story is in the new testament, therefore Christianity is based on the new testament. We don't think the old is bullshit and lies. The old testament carries a lot of good advice and really really great stories. But such things as sacrificing sheep and stuff they did in the old, we don't do that. That's why we believe in the new testament, not in the old.	2
Way to steal my idea! No problem though, In all honesty I'd rather the Snow suit in the desert, I hear freezing to death is a terrible way to go, and you didn't specify i couldn't just take it off.	I think the rules are you have to keep it on. And with the swimsuit, you can't put extra clothes on.	2
Jeez what a mood swing	I wish to be more Christlike. I saw that I was wrong and tried to fix the issue.	2
What do you call your mysterious things? You do have things that are mysterious right?	"Get ready for this. We call them ""mysteries"", or the unknown. We call them ""I don't knows"", instead of assumptions. You do not seem to comprehend this concept fully."	2
So.... for infinity God just sat around with nothing to do and then one day he was all like... Hey! Maybe I'll create a universe and stuff with people and animals and light and dark and evil and stuff!	"And Dinosaurs! God had a blast watching giant creatures tear each other apart for a few million years and then he was like ""Fuck this shit!"" and sent an asteroid to wipe them out."	2
HOW many are there?	Lots. Their are actors, singers, congresswomen, entreprenuers out there in mass numbers. I mean obviously most of the industry is still ran by men but women play a bigger role in this age.	2
I have often thought that there was a gray area here...a space where maybe attire is not important if the person practices good hygiene and looks well kept. Unfortunately, there are very few individuals in this world who actually see past the clothing. I am not talking about the difference between designer suits and regular suits, etc., I am talking about the difference between dressing professionally or not. People notice, people care, and often the people who do are the ones that control your professional destiny. While I find casual attire much more comfortable, I comply with the business attire suggestion at my place of employment.	It is scientifically proved that clothing effects one's work productivity. When the person dressed appropriately he or she became more assured and confident which results in higher work productivity.	2
English is the global language?	There are more English speakers in China than in the U.S. India too. many Europeans speak English. They speak English on Star Trek. Many Americans speak English, even though it is not the official language.	2
the rates of paid applications is very high because  it sells 20 products, but 80 products are pirated this causes them a great loss to overcome this loss they increase their price but if we use paid, the demand will be more and automatically the prices will decreas	I think you are right rajeev if the demand increases, the price decreases. why should we encourage piracy and decrease our own country's economy?	2
Sadly most Christians aren't as open-mindes as you are. You are one against the majority. Though I do believe with younger generations more Christians are becoming more like you.	Thank you. that actually means a lot to me. Galileo is one of my role models. He had the nerve to challenge false beliefs within religion. I hope I am worthy to do the same. ;)	2
Says the guy who has 3563 points..........................................	You would be good too. You just need to have at least 10 points, you wouldn't be spending them on each argument.	2
As usual, conspiracy theorists are jumping to uninformed conclusions and spreading misinformation. Snopes debunks most of the conspiracy theories here <a href='http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/newtown.asp'>http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/newtown.asp  If this were a government conspiracy, just think of how many people would have to be in on it; local law enforcement, EMT's, all the students, teachers, and parents at the school, coroners, funeral directors and their staff, news channels, etc. There is no way they could pull off a hoax of that magnitude. To think that the government would do all that just to pass some gun control laws is ridiculous. To anyone who truly believes they would do this, I have some tinfoil hats for sale that will protect you from government mind control.	^ This. With my additional comment being, even if they did set it up, do you really think the government would hire “substandard” crisis actors who “can't even pull off a believable interview”?	2
I have never been casually cruel in my entire life. Would you say the same if that was a human he shot? There is little difference. I'm not upset, I'm furious.	"Regardless if you've been ""casually cruel"" your whole life, means very little to do with him being human, and you being human; the potentiality we all hold as humans, a destructive yet beauty species.  No, it's pretty obvious I wouldn't say the same if he shot another human. (I've written countless posts pertaining to how I generally feel about human to human encounters; via justice and the death penalty, cop to civilian, ect.)   The guy did not shoot another human. The difference is huge in my opinion. Animal to animal, sure, I'd say it's a fair assessment, however to say human to human that's a big difference. Humans have more choices they make in life and are more ""aware"" of the situation. Proof? A horse is strong enough to get away from a man that is holding a leash and it didn't flee because it had a previous relationship with the human; the human fed it, took care of it, made sure it was fairly healthy enough to be kept around long enough before being shot in the head by its assumed owner.  If the horse was anything like a human, it wouldn't be sitting there calm, relaxed and without a fight. The horse stood their, without even knowing what the guy was preparing to do to it, nor with what ""weapon"". A horse does not understand what a weapon is. A horse perhaps can calculate visually what might hurt it. Do you see the difference?  I understand the whole, ""life is life is life"" ordeal, and the beauty of animals and mother nature. However, there is obviously a reason other animals, non humans, were put onto this earth.  And it's pretty obvious humans are omnivores, that is they both survive upon consuming meat and protein and vegetables/fruit, ect. So the fact that humans have been alive and the top of the food chain for a particular amount of time, tells me this is evidence to prove that animals were put onto this earth by mother nature herself, to benefit the human being in nutrition, comfort, and overall well being."	2
I realize this but that doesn't mean its necessarily true in regards to humans. I mean just because we make an observation doesn't mean it intuitive. I could say the world is flat becsuse that's what it looks like to me. Guess what?! Because of that observation we believedit for thousands of years. Now we know its not, get my point?	Common logical skills showed us the world wasn't flat. Same for humans. We share DNA relations with all species. This shows us that we originated from a single organism. An ancient ancestor.	2
Most certainly. 	How will you find the time to actually go out and buy it... much less play it?	2
No they shouldn't, but until they do, their tax exempt status should be revoked.	No they shouldn't, but until they do, their tax exempt status should be revoked. Why so?	2
What, you don't know me? Really? I am the one who sent you your first message! I have replied to may of your debates...I am deeply saddened you don't know me!	Ok. I know you exist, but I don't really know you. Lol  	2
Well I am an astronomer and I believe that the big bang explains much more than the bible can. It also has somewhat probably evidence of its occurrence. We have found stuff like residue or the continuous expansion of our universe so I favor the big bang theory.	Prove that God didn't make the big bang happen.	2
"Though it may be ""morally wrong"" to promote smoking, you have no right to ban commercials. You, as a citizen, can choose to not watch it, but ultimately, the television companies must make the decision. To them, it's simply business and that's all it should be."	If it were morally wrong to promote smoking, the government would have every right to proscribe it. But it's not. People are always responsible for themselves, no matter how much they'd like to wish it weren't so.	2
Men rule the world. That's not a good thing, that's not something I'm proud of, that I'm happy about, but it is true. It's largely due to our tribal origins, where the strongest ruled. In these times, as men were the strongest, they got to write the rules, and unfortunately, these rules have never been rewritten (see religion). Now, men don't understand that pregnancy is very important, and natural. And as such, they do not give women appropriate compensation for the differences between the genders. It is important to note that these differences are not weaknesses. For example, men need more food/calories than women do, and as such, as a man, I would expect to be given more food than a women, in a standardized meal. This is not a form of weakness, simply a difference between the needs of each gender. Therefore, I feel it is perfectly appropriate to give women compensation to try and reduce the negatives of their natural biology. Now, if it were men, they would realise these arguments quickly, and allow easy access to birth control, as well as appropriate maternity leave schemes, and religion would not be so against any of these ideas (as it was written by men).	Are you saying then, that since men tend to hold higher positions that this debates would actually be resolved in a different way, with most likely a different outcome? If that were the case, then I'd imagine that abortion wouldn't be so much up for debate, except by a few, and birth control would be paid for more easily.	2
"If you take the position that the leader of a tribe is the government, then we get into a ""chicken and the egg"" problem. I would then argue that the leaders were the shamans' bitch. ;) The leaders were bound by their superstition and thus to the shaman, which represents an early form of religion. The shaman was the real power behind the throne. The leader consulted with the shaman before making a big decision.  As far as the wedding ceremony, the shaman performed those. And that is what ties marriage to religion. ;)"	"Not every civilization has had shaman, or their equivalents. It doesn't really matter though, because the more I think about it the more I realize that it's pointless to debate the origin of marriage. First of all, it predates recorded history, so no one really knows the true origin; it's all just speculation. Second, it really has no bearing on what marriage is today. Just because something was one way in the past, does not mean it will always be that way. As I said in my original argument, marriage ""has taken many forms throughout history including polygamy, polygyny, polyandry, endogamy, exogamy, common law marriage, monogamy, arranged marriage, and same sex marriage."" So, clearly the definition of marriage has changed many times throughout history and will continue to change. Most people today think of marriage as making a commitment to someone you love."	2
JUST BECAUSE HITLER SAID HE IS FIGHTING IT doesn't mean he was telling the truth. Just listen, Hitler liked to have governmental control only when necessary. Once the war was over he was always planning on making a brutally aristocratic state (but this time the aristocrats would be Aryans as opposed to Jews).	JUST BECAUSE HITLER SAID HE IS FIGHTING IT doesn't mean he was telling the truth. He acted as a socialist. He fought capitalism. Just listen, Hitler liked to have governmental control only when necessary. Once the war was over he was always planning on making a brutally aristocratic state (but this time the aristocrats would be Aryans as opposed to Jews). Hitler had no plans of having a non-nationalized economy. His post-war plans was to develop the lands he had claimed for Germany, enslave the slavs and eventually expand the empire even further.	2
Then I rescind my argument.	I am glad to hear that.	2
That is should have happened a while ago. I am more of a futurist.	I don't remember the exact verses, but in both Matthew and Mark, Jesus told listeners that some of them would still be alive during the second coming. This was, of course, 2000 years ago...	2
I think act the same is my solution. What's the proper solution?	I don't know really what a proper solution would be. I just know making everyone the same isn't really a solution. Imagine if we did succeed making everyone the same, and suddenly a totally different person is born. Then there would be racism against him, right? So you haven't really solved the problem. It's like instead of fixing the real problem you're just covering it up or hiding it. But like I said, I don't know any proper way to erase racism.	2
I did give the site to three people from there. But they just aren't ready to leave the old one yet I think. Though I'm pretty sure since there aren't tits on this site it'll weed out the idiots if I did post it XD	Tits? Did someone say tits? I'm all for tits ; )	2
OMG RANDOM DUDE :p Seriously? We don't think its untrue. Its just not what our religion is based on.	I thought you weren't a Christian?	2
Everyone has a desire to keep living. You claim that we ought to just kill ourselves, therefore contradicting our desire to keep living. Obviously, the burden of proof is on you. It may just be a matter of opinion, but until you argue in favor of it, your claim can be disregarded. Your opinion is bad.	"Everyone has a desire to keep living. Everyone? Not true. Those whom commit/will commit suicide, no longer had/have the desire to live. Thus it is a matter of opinion.  You claim that we ought to just kill ourselves, therefore contradicting our desire to keep living. The only contradiction here, is the one which was caused by first statement of your post. And I was posting that last post to end this little thing, since the point can't really be argued any further, but some people just like to have the last word I guess. (oh, but now someones gonna think, ""looks like you're doing the same thing"", but it was obviously just to refute the lame point that the opposition was trying to make.)"	2
they need to stop. get over it. and move on. alot of them don't to work and are blaming this and government. they need to get off there butts drop the beer and get a job. I commend those black people that work and don't complain you are one of America's greatest white/black people. :D	I think it is highly racist for you to presume that most African American people do not work and drink beer all day. And news flash, not only are there many black people who are presidents and ceo's of companies. And there is a very large amount of white American's that complain about how they can't get a fair shake because of affirmative action which is complete crap, like the leg up they got from jim crow didn't help.	2
If you didn't wake up through-out the process of your member getting into the garbage disposal, through whatever means, I think there is little chance the sound would wake you up.  Unless I have severely underestimated you. To which I would say, kudos, sir.	I'm a heavy sleeper. But the slightest sounds wakes me up ;)	2
What about the animals that owned it before them? What about the animals that owned it before those animals? You see how this logic is flawed? When we have needs we take, carnivores need to eat so they take the meat of animals. Herbivores need to eat so they take the life of plants. Humans need to thrive in civilizations so they take the lands of creatures that exist there. It's survival of the fittest when it comes down to basic animal nature and if we are not the fittest we lose, or if they aren't they lose.	Ahh, I see where you come from, But those animals were being allowed to live there with the native Americans, the animals before those animals have all died out. Humans should learn to accept other peoples way of living rather than forcing their home right from under their feet.	2
I am not sure which part you don't like. I believe it is obvious that if everyone is the same that there won't be racism. Please let me know if you are disputing that. I didn't dispute. I know that there won't be racism if everyone is the same - I just wanted to ask you if you thought making everyone the same is a proper solution for racism.	I know, I didn't mean it like that, I meant to ask what wasn't clear. I hope I helped clear it up though. I do believe the solution is making everyone the same. But, I don't think that it needs to be literal. People can be different, but act very close to the same.	2
I agree. There is no point in debating the origin of marriage. So let's take it to another level. Do you see any value in creating a word analogous to marriage but that can only be used by the other side (the 2 sides being religion and government). I propose we reserve one word for religious purposes and use the other word for civil purposes. I don't care which side ends up with the word marriage as long as we have 2 words to differentiate what we are talking about. I loath making words more ambiguous. I prefer words with clear meaning. But hey..., that's just me ;)	Sounds like a good idea to me .	2
It's to prevent bots taking up account spaces for real users.	Oh, okay. Thank you. :)	2
I find it strange though what happened to all of the Kennedy's over the years. I mean, not many of them died in their sleep, did they? Assassinations, cancer, plane crashes, etc. Something bad happened to most of them, so it is leading me to believe more and more that there is some type of curse or something put on them, although I can't prove it or anything.	What goes around comes around. JFK got whacked because he didn't want WWIII, (which is why he is one of my favorite presidents), RFK got whacked because he spoke too harshly against those who put him in power (mafia). Teddy was a little smarter....well, for a while at least. We all know that if it wasn't for his family's money that he would have been in jail loooooooooooooooong time ago. Well, nothing lasts forever. He caused quite a few women a lot of discomfort, so perhaps this is one way that the almighty paid him back to suffer so much at the end.	2
I didn't know until now that English wasn't your first language...	Hahaha ;b  It's okay :) I'll take that as a complement :)	2
I just got the word trolley from Wikipedia actually. Let's not try and pick holes in the hypothetical, just assume that it is a cable car, that could be stopped by a very fat man. Let's say the fat man has, I dunno, sodden clothes or something. Maybe he's a jedi, but this is more about morality than practicality.	I was trying to troll and became genuinely confused when Axe said that the cable car I was picturing was actually supposed to be a shopping cart.  Aaaaaaanyways, now I'll get around to actually answering it.	2
LET'S HAVE GAY SEX!!!	Why would you want that? My arse is hairy and muscular, you'd have some trouble getting your minuscule todger past my God-like buns of steel, and I'd probably criple you if I had a go at you, also I'm more into the ladies, unlike <a href='http://i.imgur.com/DXwoZ.jpg'>you.	2
But what if he didn't eat anything else for the next 8 days, so he was getting 3,000 a day on average?	That's a major what if. Sure it counts as valid but from a logical standpoint, in an average situation. Taking that many calories in at once is bad.	2
"The problem is they call themselves ""a godless congregation"". Even though they may not explicitly tell theists ""you're wrong,"" by calling it a godless congregation it sounds exclusionary and unwelcoming to theists. Try to look at it the other way around. If there was a similar organization that called themselves a god worshiping congregation do you think many atheists would feel welcomed? I know I wouldn't. I just don't see why they need to call themselves a ""godless congregation."" If their goal truly is just to ""live better, help often, wonder more"" then whether you believe in god or not should be irrelevant."	I don't feel that means they will bad mouth God. If we take it at its truest meaning, it is a congregation where God is not talked about. I would have to see what the do in this congregation because I can't even imagine it at all. If there was a similar organization that called themselves a god worshiping congregation do you think many atheists would feel welcomed? I don't really think that is the problem, and I don't think it would be so bad for Atheists to go to that. The biggest problem with the Christian congregations is that they add the part that not worshiping God makes you a bad person. If it was a God congregation where people discuss what they are thankful for and attribute it to God, but don't look down on those who don't attribute it to God, I think they could get some Atheists to show up.	2
"NOTE: The following contains discriminating language towards homosexuals. This is not intended as an insult as you will see. Trust me, I am the last person you'd find as a bigot here. -- This is what I do, because it generally confuses the antagonist in this situation. Bad guy - ""Hey faggot!"" You - ""I'll show you a faggot!"" Bad guy - ""Im sure you would!"" You - ""Are you coming on to me? I thought I was suppose to be the gay one."" Generally this envokes a moment of akward silence. You being secure about your sexuality would then laugh. The antagonist, now dumbfounded, would accept defeat."	I have nothing against homosexuals. My best friend is a gay guy (he helps me with my shopping) lolz. Ily Daniel!!!! -- Haha i gottsta try that. That would make a hell of an awkward moment, not for me but for the bad guy.	2
Fiscally liberal = right-wing (which I am the opposite of in many respects) I personally don't view hating drugs as being socially conservative and in every other respect I am socially liberal.	Fiscally liberal = right-wing Being fiscally liberal means that you support greater government role and control over the economy. That is not a right wing belief. I personally don't view hating drugs as being socially conservative Being anti-drug is very large part of being socially conservative.	2
"Define ""respect"" and define ""belief."""	It's up to you to define respect. it's your opinion on weather something is respectable or not. and for beliefs use a dictionary	2
Doughnuts are my Kryptonite. I know I shouldn't eat them too much, but I saw a half dozen on sale for like $1, so I HAD to buy them	I usually love maple bars! They are super good!  	2
I'm confused already! Is it Sunday yet? On the bright side you'll be getting lots of nasty replies from a certain sitar playing someone! :))	I think I may have gotten on her shit list too so you may be getting nasty replies yourself ;)	2
Yes if you don't know what you are doing and constantly places your money on things that it shouldn't go to.. Some of these famous people today don't know how to manage their money not all their networth are high as they should be because their is area that they are in debt.	There are a lot of people in debt because they tried to buy a house and the market collapsed. There are tons of people who are in debt because they never had enough to survive. There is absolutely no reason to feel sorry for the person who earned over a million dollars and is in debt.	2
You Americans have a different word for trolley? You people really need to learn proper English. Anyway, it is the device used to put products in when shopping. It has four wheels and is often made of metal arranged in a wire frame. If you still need a further description I can find a photo and post the link here.	I was kidding, originally, but now I'm genuinely confused. Based on the description in Chuck's debate (tracks, the speed of the trolley, etc,) I had assumed by trolley he meant trolley car, or trolley bus. The kind of electric tram thing, a cable car, or mini-train kind of deal that moves throughout a city. We have those in SF.  What you just described is a shopping cart. What we call a shopping cart, anyways.  I was kind of wondering how a fat man, regardless of how large he is, could stop a speeding cable car if you pushed him in front of it. But similarly I don't see how a shopping cart, even if it was filled with lead and bricks, could kill five people at once, and I don't see how the kids playing on tracks has any relevance to a shopping cart, though it would to a cable car.	2
Actually equal protection under the law in fact if you read it it goes a bit in the opposite direction. It originally allowed for slavery and held that only land owners had rights and since it was illegal at that time and for quite some time afterwords for women and blacks to own property outright I any such language resides in that document at leas with such an absolute meaning as you are asserting. Lets not forget that most of the founding fathers were slave owners. As it turns out equal protection under the law as we think of it today is a very new idea.	As you said I'm talking about the constitution well equal protection under the law comes from the constitution.	2
Okay. I will find out myself. :) I am new here, will get to know more things in a couple of days.	Good, I just don't want new people to be spamming too easily. The limitation has it's uses, but can become annoying. If you post some good arguments i'll tell you.	2
also i didnt mean to post nothing, i mustve hit create because i was checking on my cat i thought she got hurt, but ya, then i opened internet, and i usually use chrome, and i wasnt logged in on internet, like i am on chrome and i mustve forgotten my password so i thought my account got banend so i created a new account with the real proof i meant to give, but i was going to put that on here, but i figuredm the hell with it, it will be interesting to see what people say to empty proof :D	You can edit a debate after you've posted it.	2
Is it just me or do tons of people from Norcal go to UCLA and tons of people from Socal go to Berkeley.	Well... my friend chose UCLA based on the high number of female Asians at that school. Other than that I don't know. UCSD is made up mostly of exchange students and other cutes female Asians.	2
Hey, Happy Birthday! You're 1000 days old on this site.	Thank you! 95 more days and it will be my 3rd year that I have been on the site.	2
I agree, Joe and well put! He may be looked at as a freedom fighter by his rag-tag group of fundamentalist fanatics but that would be the extent of it. He is a terrorist...pure and simple!	Maybe we can shave his naughty bits once and let him suffer a bad rash as the hair grew back ;)	2
"Yeah, can't really look you in the face over the Internet; but I would not, in fact, prefer dragging my balls through STD infested broken glass (don't know how glass contracts a disease, I'd have gone with ""STD coated glass"") to watching a cartoon.  Watching My Little Pony would be rather annoying; but (and I can only imagine) potentially contracting a sexually transmitted disease through shredded scrotum skin has got to be more annoying."	Oh, well I guess this is where we depart. .	2
I believe the green house effect is real. I've noticed in cities where there are alot of cars that the exhaust traps in the sun's heat. But our cars are not enough to heat the whole planet. We only have enough total power to change it about 2%. The Earth is big. We are small. Also the trees by the road are healthy. You know why? it's because our carbon dioxide & monoxide is their oxygen. They breath those gases. A couple years ago when my science class showed us the movie Inconvienent Truth I believed in global warming. I used to be against using oil & wanted everyone to switch to ethanol. But then I learned how expensive & unefficent ethanol is. I still support alternative fuel research but I don't think we should let that get in the way of drilling here.	if the trees and bushes and other plants breathe in our carbon monoxide and our polutants, then shouldn't our pollution be making the earth healthier? or do i just have this all mixeded up?:(	2
Yeah, having to work is a bummer...lol....just kiddin ;) !!	Well since we weren't born rich.......we'll have to keep the day job.	2
Same are you saying you miss me if so I missed you to.	Well yes I haven't seen you in a long time. Its good seeing you again :)	2
That's right Srom... now there is now only one!	So anyone with a number after GuitarGuy is a fake and isn't GuitarGuy!	2
Good point.  Do you get double gifts? Because that would be kind cool. And another upside is you don't get full attention on you. I have a twin brother and I never do on my birthday. One year he was out of town on our birthday and I hated all the attention from my parents being on me XD	I don't really get double gifts. But I've got the sort of WWII-rationed style family who think sets of colouring pencils and socks are good gifts.  I suppose I don't mind not get lots of attention, I prefer it that way.	2
"You did not do a single thing I asked of you. People claim that they have evidence that points to his nonexistence. So show me the evidence. That is all I ask. You answered in the ""Here is the evidence"" column so be productive and give me some evidence. Otherwise don't bother saying anything."	So you don't have any evidence? 	2
Roman soldiers' only strength was numbers. The Greeks knew martial war as an art as well as a practical method.	I agree man. you are so write. Your quite the smart one you know that?	2
Are you going to be going back to school too?	I am waiting a year at least. I will apply to a two year long study that is kind of like a quick college degree ( The system is different here in Denmark, we don't have high schools or colleges ) But I don't know if I will wait one or two year, depending on how I feel and if I feel my daughter can enter kindergarten. But I strongly believe that a newborn should be with her mother as long as possible, so I am not going to be working or going to school for a year. Maybe I will do some ''homework'' - I have a job on a website, which gives me a very low payment, but it's something :) With that I can work while she .. is sleeping or something ;)	2
"There was once me and my friends were evading some patrols in the school , and we hid in a public toilet and wait for things to cool down , then we found out there's a couple making out ... then suddenly one of the patrols point his flashlight at us but we were fast enough to dodge it though (damn I literary hit the deck and got dirt all over) . After the patrols left we just sitting next to the stairs and eat our dinner calmly while the couple continues with their little ""adventure"" ..."	Sounds....... kinky?	2
what about emotional abuse? you shouldve made it physical vs emotional abuse, thatd be a more interesting debate, id have to say... verbal abuse though, physical abuse is bad, and there is some serious damage that can be done, but i think verbal abuse ties into emotional abuse, well they both do really... hmm... i think verbal abuse is worse than physical abuse because physical pain comes and goes, it makes you stronger, imo, but verbal abuse, that shit hurts, being told youre not loved by anyone is far damaging than having a broken bone, bones heal, hearts never fully heal, they may seem like they do, but deep down they dont heal all the way...	I actually meant emotionally abusive. I'll fix it. I don't know why I put verbal.... I'm tired. It's like four in the morning here. lol	2
In America support for it is rapidly declining is Religion is having a big revival in South Europe working up to the North so they think support for it will go rapidly up in the next 50 years until evolution is banned. I think one GOP bill would make it illegal for evolution to be taught in schools.	Unlikely in Europe and stop throwing random number around if you cannot back it up.	2
But look at that face man... THAT FACE! GAH! KILL IT! KILL IT WITH FIRE! Hm, did I just lose it a little bit? Well, that's what Lady Carey does to a man.	I did it doesn't bother me. I guess it's because I have a ton of His movies and looked at His face way to much that if I see His face in anything it doesn't mess with me one bit. It more funny to me then creepy which it is not at all.	2
Cavemen had to eat and run or get eaten themselves. We evolved from cavemen so we must carry the gene to eat on the run. Women evolved from cavewomen so they must have that gene too. Also, my mom complains about certain family members that, when they come to visit us, eat and run. I once ate what my mom cooked and I got the runs. I know running is not the same as swimming but I'm sure it helps mix up the food in there so that it can be digested fully. If I just sit there, the food in the middle of the pile won't get digested. Spell check is telling me that I spelled cavewomen wrong and now I don't know who is being sexist; me for using cavemen or spell-check for not knowing cavewomen. I feel sorry for cavemen. They had to kill lions in order to make their lioncloth and when they saw a pretty cavewoman she would immediately know. How embarrassing!!! They didn't even have school books to hide it. I have to go now. Mom said I can go back now and swim.  ;)	I like this idea.  You, I like.  Thanks.  And then there was fifty random characters who showed up to meet an absurd quota.	2
Thank you for not even staying on tooic. I am not talking about that. I realize how atheists think. I am not asking for possibility. What I am saying is they deny the two line up with the Bible.	Eve was made from Adam's rib. Please, show me a human that can rip out a rib and make a woman. Other wise desperat men would have women. Go ahead. Explain. Evolution is not supported by the bible. I think I understand more about evolution that you do. I study bacteria, viruses, plagues, fungi, etc. I have to study their origin as well and they do source back to a logical origin of their birth. Eve was made from a rib. Enough said.	2
I just picked an answer so I could comment. I just want to forget this artificial race stuff. Our religion teaches in Acts 17:26 that we are all one human race. I has a a sad. :'(	Umm I believe you need to read more carefully on what side you are	2
Running and racing is what these dogs are born to do. This is what their passion is; what they love doing. As anyone who has been to the beginning of the Iditarod can tell you, the dogs can't wait to be harnessed and start running. They are whining in the trucks as the teams get ready, they are whining and pulling at the harnesses while getting harnessed, and once they get going, they pull with all their might, and are completely happy. It's always a shame when dogs die during the race, but at least they died doing what they loved. It's a tough race for human and dog alike, and not even all of the human racers make it to the end.	Yeah, it's good for those dogs to participate in these kinds of competitions or races since it will ensure they will stay in good health. I personally enjoy the Iditarod too and the dogs doesn't seem a single bit reluctant about the race when it was about to start. Death is something that cannot be avoided in the race since if a dog is tired he cannot stop running because if he were to stop abruptly to rest, the others will be thrown forward and the person behind the dogs will be invovled in the unfortunate crash.	2
Could someone please explain why this was down voted? if it was because you disagree with my positions, that's not good enough.	wasn't me )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))	2
I agree with the whole idea. But, changing one's mind has hardly anything to do with alterations in intelligence. Does it?	Well..., in order to change your intelligence, you need to be able to change your belief system. If you can't change your belief system, your intelligence remains constant.	2
