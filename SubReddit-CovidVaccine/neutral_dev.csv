"Has it affected your sense of taste?  Hoping symptoms stay mild and you recover quickly.","Thank you. I slightly lost my taste for one day, and it already came back. I never lost my smell.",1
"I'd say you'd get less sick, because your body basically thinks it ""caught"" COVID a week ago, so you're already ahead of the game when it comes to immune system training.","Ok. I finally had my second Pfizer dose this morning and just got notification this evening that my son is a close contact of someone at school that tested positive and is under quarantine for two weeks. I just wondered what would happen if he does get it and then I do so soon.",1

"I got a third Moderna vaccine Saturday, on the advice of my doctor. I live in a low vaccine rate and very low mask usage area. I have an autoimmune disease and take immunosuppressant medications to help manage it. I'm high risk in an area where high risk people are completely on their own to protect themselves. I feel awful this morning. Fatigued, headache, body aches from head to toe. For some reason my collarbones and upper back hurt the worst. Queasy, low appetite. My upper arm that I received the vaccine in feels like someone whacked it with a baseball bat. There's a hard itchy welt at the injection site. But this will pass in a few days, it did after my second vaccine. Except for the injection site reaction, that lingered several days. It's no fun, but no worse than an autoimmune flare. Which is something I experience on a semi-regular basis. My doctor said I really needed to do this and I trust her judgment. I'll just take it easy and get through it.","Ok. I'm getting over the immune system response now. I felt pretty crappy all day Sunday, went to bed very early. Was up a few times through the night and early morning because body aches made it impossible to sleep. Went back to bed around 9 am this morning, woke up around 2 p.m. feeling way better.  Headache gone, body aches gone, feeling hot (but never actually ran a fever) gone, queasiness gone. Just a little bit fatigued and brain foggy this afternoon. So it wasn't really bad with the third vaccine. Hope my body makes good use of it.",1

I was prescribed a cream and they are going away. I am so sorry because mine itch so bad and I have never had eczema.","God I really hope I've got the same thing then, seeing others say they've had this for many months is freaking me out. Mine are also itching soooooooooooooooooooooo bad! I can't wait to see someone about it, ty for sharing btw, I'm freaking out a bit less now.",1
"This makes me feel so much better. I had covid December of 2020 and then got the j&amp;j vaccine in April. I had a really rough time after getting the vaccine and then had some other issues pop up right  after. so I have been very anxious about getting a booster! I think I will go ahead and get the Pfizer booster and hope for the best!","Trust me when I say I understand the anxiety completely. Wishing you the best of luck!",1
"Thank you for asking this. I've been trying to find out too. I've only had one shot of Moderna and a few days later got palpitations and chest pain.  I didn't go to 2nd shot for fear","Yes I'm interested in this as well. I'm now 12 weeks post 1st Pfizer shot.  I've been unwell for a few years still no solid diagnosis.   But I got the first shot. Besides my arm soreness and fatigues, I had really bad heart palpitations for 3 weeks, spikes and drops in blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, bad vertigo, tinnitis, and horrible weakness, again all for weeks.  I support vaccinations but am really concerned with getting the second shot. My doc is reluctant too.  But I'm also very worried about not being fully vaccinated.Very curious if this delay will lessen the potential symptoms after 2nd shot.  Thoughts?  Thank you!",1

"Hi ya, I’m a registered nurse that received two doses and gives covid vaccines. My arm hurt(!) for the longest time about two months. the first time I got the shot I was fine but the second time in the photo I have Of the person giving it to me it’s a little bit too high in the arm and i felt pain right when she gave it. I received mine in dec/jan and by may I was definitely pain free. Not saying it lasted 5 months but it wore off eventually. I’d say it’s from the needle/injection not the medication in the injection. And to those throwing shade about being new on reddit with no history - i joined like a week ago to get info on boosters. My husband uses reddit but i did a big social media purge awhile back. Hope you feel better!","I’m new too. it’s just a place to read more raw information. Least for me it is an my family an friends aren’t on here so that’s nice also",1

"I got j&amp;j originally and decided on Pfizer booster and OMFG my lymph nodes felt like they were gonna rip out my skin! They felt like they were burning inside as well haha... never felt that before in my life but my dad said it's a good sign because it means my immune system is working... so I put a heat pad on it and kept my arm elevated and netflixed and chilled...thankfully it only felt bad for 2 days, a week later I'm all good!","Yep! Lymph nodes and immune systems are for sure fascinating. Every year my daughter gets a cold and the lymph nodes behind her ear swell up when her body fights it. The first time I noticed it, it definitely freaked me out though!",1
"What?","Believe OP is asking what medical conditions would cause a doctor to advise you to not get the vaccine. Just speculating, though. OP, if this is the case, have a chat with your doctor if you have medical conditions that you’re concerned about interacting with the vaccine.",1

"I'm walking so I'll make this short: Serious adverse effects normally occur within 0-5 days (80%). Some (20%) can occur from day 6-24. Nothing will ever happen after that.","Actually you don't know that because there have not been any long term clinical trials on these vaccines and no research on long term effects of injecting spike proteins into one's body. Hopefully your right.",1
"This is just my guess, but it could be your body’s immuno response. When fighting off infection, your heart rate can tend to elevate, which your body is fighting as a response to the vaccine (mimicking infection) I just got my 2nd dose yesterday and I am pretty sure I noticed the same thing. As for the shortness of breath, it could be anxiety related because you are scared of the possibility of having symptoms. I had covid July 2020 and I haven’t felt the same since with breathing, but I genuinely think it is because of how anxious I have become about shortness of breath ever since covid started. When I’m not thinking about it, no trouble breathing. When I’m thinking about it, lots of trouble breathing. I also have an anxiety disorder related to medicine and the fear of infection/medicine so it makes it a lot worse for me. You’re okay! Everything is okay. (Also F early 20’s)","Thank you! I guess it’s a good thing then that it’s reacting to the vaccine! I have zero anxiety luckily, I was expecting to get all fluey and so have been quite pleased this is my only symptom haha. I was curious to see if other people had it, because it’s not reported as a side effect often (well apart from the NHS saying you should seek urgent care which is very dramatic, and I assume for much higher heart rates). It makes sense that it’s a side effect as it’s part of your body’s immuno response, would have thought it would be more common!",1
"Dr. Peter McCullough mentioned a COVID immunity t-cell test. He mentioned that many infections don’t give you high enough antibodies so they can comeback negative, but the t-cell was more definitive.I’d have to listen to the podcast again to see exactly what test he referred to.","Ok thank you, I’m going after lunch to see my GD and talk about it",1
"I have a metallic taste since my 2nd shot of Pfizer, its over a week now not going away.","I had that taste after the first one! But went away in a few minutes",1
"It's the amount of vaccine inside each jab.

So yes, Moderna gives you more vaccine than Pfizer in each injection. But the effectiveness from trials are similar for both vaccines.","Thank you!",1
"Listen to yourself and do not rely on what a doctor says. You know your own body and you have to live in your body. At the end of the day - the safety of this new mrna technology is not known. If you are feeling these effects already - why potentially make them any worse.","Thank you, appreciate the advice!",1
"Received my booster this past Saturday at 9:35am. Felt OK most of Saturday save some tenderness in my injection arm. By late afternoon I was definitely fatigued. Went to bed early, around 8pm. At 9:35pm precisely I was woken up by some seriously violent chills. Took motrin, and an hour later I was finally able to stop shivering, fell back to sleep. At 11:00 work up again only this time burning up, checked and my temp was at 103. This is the first actual fever I’ve had after the vaccine, previously was only severe chills and general serious flu like symptoms. I wasn’t able to sleep really at all the remainder of the night. I keep motrin in me as often as allowed, but stayed on the couch all of Sunday, and went to bed at 7pm Sunday evening. Monday I was still out of it until about 12pm and ended up using PTO because I just couldn’t hang. With the exception of the general arm soreness I’m doing just fine now. This dose hit harder, no faster, but in different ways than previous.","After my second dose I set a record for how much I slept. I literally was in bed aside from eating and going to the bathroom for 36 hours. I hope this booster doesn't effect me the same. Lol.",1
"Me too! Mine will go up to 160 sometimes for no reason, it's terrifying. My resting heart rate is almost always over 100","Same! My resting heart rate has increased significantly despite exercising regularly, eating well, and being in about the same shape as before if not better. I have also noticed I sweat a lot more while working out and my heart rate increases by about 20 bpm more than it did previously during hitt workouts. It’s scaring me. I had my second dose several months ago. My siblings are having the same issue. They got vaccines several months before me",1
"I'm so glad you posted this. I didn't have a great reaction to my second covid vax and in the back of my mind wondered about the flu shot. I'd never had issues with the flu shot before though. Then my coworker said she wasn't feeling great from her flu shot and that got me pretty concerned. I'm guessing it's the strain of the flu shot this year like someone else noted and not related to having had the covid vaccine. Still pretty nervous. Gonna do mine on a Friday and hope for the best.","How was your flu shot?",1
"I had the second dose of Pfizer vaccine back in January and about a month ago I’ve been having twitching non stop 24/7 all over my body.Bloodwork didn’t contain any answers and go for a follow up with my PCP this week. I started taking magnesium 400mg per dayAnd still no relief. This is getting annoying.Anybody experiencing this?","Will you get your second?",1
"I scheduled a moderna booster (pfizer 2 shots last spring) for next week but feeling a little nervous about changing. I am all about trying new things though. Watching this thread. Thank you to those who have gone before me.","I received the half dose m booster about 18 hrs ago. Immediately after the shot I noticed my arm was very sore when opening the door to leave. I started to feel feverish around 15 hours after the vaccine. My temp has been sitting around 100.5 - 101 for the past three hours. Otherwise I am tired, achey, arm still hurts but nothing over the top. If I go over 102 or get a headache I will take acetaminophen. Otherwise I’ll just try to experience it. Are titers reliable now? Just curious as to where I am as a friend who got 3 m shots compared to my 2 p + 1 m around the same time frame.",1
"So, I had a severe adverse reaction to Pfizer, BUT my period is just normal like always.","I had a severe reaction to Pfizer. My period took 3 months to normalize.",1
"I have health anxiety too which is the reason why I wont be getting the vaccine.  With that said though... I bet you're just freaking yourself out.  The mind can play tricks like you said - Numbness, minor pains etc... I went through an anxiety attack in 2019 pretty bad.  with that said - a lot of people who are pro vax are also often anti side effects of the vax. They will call it a coincidence or think that its OK to feel weird for months after getting injected.  It blows my mind.  With that said, I would advise you to try to relax your mind and body and soul. I'm sure things will get better.  Breathwork and 2 minute cold showers help relieve anxiety for me.I will also say that the internet is terrible because any symptom you google, you will find... It's better to stay offline or google searching when you have anxiety from my experience.","I just looked into GBS and it looks to be extremely rare.  Highly unlikely you have that especially healthy with no auto immune disorders.  I would try and reduce any alcohol and try and get rest and meditate if possible. I'm sure you're going to be fine.",1
"Yep got my moderna booster yesterday and I just have a sore arm. Slightly achey this morning but I can go about my day as normal-which is different from my 2nd dose.","Same. Got my Moderna booster Wednesday. Slightly tender at the injection site. That's it.",1
"why won’t 70% of the comments show for me on a majority of posts to this sub?","Probably the mods, not sure if they can hide comments, but they love deleting anything suggesting the injections don't work.",1
"Sorry to hear that :(((. Vaccination is unfortunately not 100% protection. I think it’s around 80-90 % (depends on your body, type of vaccine, variation of covid etc) however I am not a doctor so don’t quote me on that. But I think you should be fine and you shouldn’t have any serious symptoms!Good luck, hope you gonna be healthy soon.","Thanks. Paying for a last minute flight sucks",1
"I'm in your boat.  First and second Pfizer shots, no big deal.  8 months later, Pfizer booster.  5 days after booster, bam!  Migraine headaches, brain fog, dizzy AF, it's like a perpetual hangover.  Has been like this for 8 days now and today just slightly better.  Seen stories of it lasting anywhere from 2 weeks to 5 months.  Brutal for sure but it'll pass with time.**Felt like I should edit this comment in case others come across it**  My whole ordeal last around 6 weeks.  One week after booster had debilitating side effects.  On the 7th week after booster I can say I'm 95% better, and started to feel better after 6 weeks.  Migraines are gone, brain fog gone, dizziness 95% gone.  Took all sorts of supplements but the thing that I felt helped the most was hardcore migraine medication, Imitrex.  Started taking that 5 weeks in to my symptoms and a week later felt great.  Migraine was gone within a couple days.  May have just been correlated with time to recovery too - but feel pretty awesome now, very thankful.","Lasted 5 weeks for me with my 1st shot and I haven’t gotten any since.",1
"Every time I think I'm ready for the j&amp;j shot posts like this one come along","Just got it on Friday and had COVID in April. So far so good. Yesterday I had the cold sweats and achey joints and all is better now.Hoping that is it, will see though",1
"Day 31 for me. CT scan last week showed nothing wrong with my head. It was a relief but incredibly frustrating at the same time. It’ll get better. It has to get better. I’ve read success stories in this subreddit of people getting better and while still frustrated, I remain hopeful. I am definitely having less severe of a brain fog than week 2-3 so I’m getting better little by little.","Sending so much love I understand hope we figure this out",1
"I assume you don't have past experiences with long term exposure to cigarette smoke to compare it to? In any case, some of the symptoms you describe could reasonably be attributed to the smoke. It's probably worth dealing with that first.

If the problem goes away one you've dealt with the smoke, then you don't have to worry about it. Even if, by some crazy freak coincidence, your issue were somehow exacerbated by the vaccine and the cigarette smoke, you can rest assured knowing the the side effect is short lived and not a big deal.","Good idea, thanks",1
"SIL got both Pfizer (don't know when but not while pregnant), is breastfeeding my 5 month old nephew, both are fine. Based on the studies we've read, she's passing the antibodies on to him.

Get the shot.","What would happen if you were bf your toddler with the vaccine? Or if you were to express milk in a cup and give it to the 2 year old would they get benefits?",1
"All your tests came back okay, so I assume all your electrolyte levels are as well? Myocarditis usually presents with severe chest pain that increases when a breath is drawn and has distinct markers that are present when running tests that check cardiac function and presence of the specific enzyme in the blood that correlated to some type of heart damage/inflammation. It’s possible you’ve had it, but just heart palpitations points to something else - Magnesium.It’s been something I’ve been seeing on this subreddit and other vaccine subreddits recently. People complain about heart palpitations after vaccination, they then take a magnesium supplement and it goes away or decreases in frequency. I’m not a doctor, but that is something that you should look into. And if you haven’t already, get a full panel done that checks all your vitamin levels.I’m sorry you’ve had to go through this, but you’re not alone. Give us an update if anything new develops.","I got all my levels checked because I often suffer from anaemia and everything came back normal, I did have chest pain and arm pain which is why I was admitted because my doctor thought I was having a heart attack, my blood pressure was also 140/90",1
"I’m going on six months after my first dose with ongoing side effects.  Luckily, my doctors are starting to acknowledge it in writing in my chart, so I’ve been printing those for my records.","How difficult was it to get your doctor to actually document a vaccine related injury?  My best friend is having major complications and his doctor straight up refused to even see him for intermittent shortness of breath.  Told him to go to urgent care instead.  WTF",1

"A few questions from someone who is..... scientifically challenged1. Using at least my common sense, your antibodies decreased significantly from months 1-4, finishing out at 47au/ml. What kind of protection does 47au/ml give you? For example, best estimates show the vaccine to be what, 91-95% effective after the second dose? and around 80-95% from one dose of either MRNA vaccines. What % of effectiveness would you assume you are at now after 4 months? 2. I am currently thinking of skipping the second dose for right now due to side effects, most prevalent being Myocarditis; do you think that waiting a month and letting my antibodies from the first injection diminish a little, then getting the second vaccine dose reduce my risk of side effects?3. More so a statement, but I wonder how much waiting a few months before doing your second dose will effect the longevity of antibodies compared to people following the normal CDC schedule","Antibody protection against COVID is not the way most people get over COVID.  People who recover from COVID often have less antibody production than those that get very sick.  Cell mediated immunity is king for infections like COVID.

"Hi, fellow emetephobe here! Nausea and vomiting are very rare side effects, and are usually seen in people who get nauseous and vomit any time they feel slightly off (even with just a fever or a headache), and who are generally stomach-y people. Remember that as emetephobes, our brain is really freaking powerful at not letting us throw up. A lot of people vomit way more easily than we do. I didn’t get Pfizer myself, but from a logistics standpoint, it’s a smaller dosage than the Moderna vaccine (30 micrograms versus 100 micrograms), which means it has less of a chance of those kind of side effects. And I believe (need to find the source on this) if you look at the studies released after the initial vaccine trials, the incidence of nausea and vomiting were the same for the experimental group and the placebo group. So it’s possible those people got sick because they’re sensitive to needles, or because they’re just stomach-y people. A word of advice - eat well before you get the shot, hydrate very well with electrolytes 24-48 hours before you get the shot, and buy yourself some soup, saltine crackers, and maybe make some plain white rice to have read to eat after your shot. Keep hydrated very well with electrolytes 3-4 days after your shot (Pedialyte, Gatorade works well). Avoid foods that might cause inflammation (for example, if you’re lactose intolerant, don’t eat dairy for a few days before or after the shot). The side effects are caused by the inflammation triggered by your immune response to the vaccine. So anything you can do to keep your inflammation low will help. And staying hydrated and fed will help you so much!You’ve got this. And you will be fine, I promise. I got J&amp;J and had 0 nausea and vomiting. There are people on the emetephobe sub who have gotten fully vaccinated with Pfizer and have been fine. You can do it!!!PS - the risk of vomiting because of covid, especially the Delta variant, is so much greater than the risk that comes with the shot. So you’re way better off getting the shot.

The CDC has not published guidance about what to do if it has been more than 6 weeks since your first shot.

So I got a Moderna in July, rather than keep worrying about Delta. The only side effect was a day of being tired and about four days of arm pain at the injection site. From what I’ve read up to now, it doesn’t seem to be necessary to get the second Moderna, having already gotten the J and J. But I may do it later. Please note, I’m not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV.","Thank you for the info and your experience.",1
"Sending you all the good vibes!! I finally got my 1st dose today around 3pm. It’s not 12:24am and my injection site is sore and my neck is starting to ache.

"That means it's working.","Really? Care to elaborate?",1
"Heart pain is a scary thing. Having said that, the stress we’ve all faced from a pandemic and lockdown coupled with the chatter about potential side effects and complications from this vaccine just ramps up the anxiety. It may sound silly but practice meditation or controlled breathing exercises especially during the times when your heart races. You may find that you have more control over these responses than you realize. I am a heart patient and after my 1st vaccine dose in March I experienced some of what you describe but through breathing was able to slow my racing heartbeat and anxiety. With the 2nd dose I had no complications. Best of luck to you.Edited to add: I had Moderna","Did you get both shots on the same arm?",1
"I suspect it depends on the study or post. However, this subreddit has become overrun with trolls and misinformed conspiracy theorists often looking to spread an idea with bad intent.Further, on everything else in your life, are you this skeptical? If not, why are you being skeptical here?","This is coming from someone who has been vaccinated, but at any rate, take it with a grain of salt. I can understand why some people would be skeptical about big pharma and their track record, especially with the exemption of liability, but I’m choosing to trust that the FDA has to their utmost ability vetted the product.",1

"After the first dose I felt really tired for a day or two and my arm was quite sore. Second dose I had no effects after.My wife had a very sore arm and there was a some sort of (not itchy) rash around the injection point, and she had a fever and chills for the next day after the first dose. Second dose she had no effects","Is this available in the US?",1

"Hello! When is your second dose scheduled? I'm personally not comfortable advising you on whether you should get the second dose, I just want to reassure you that you are VERY likely to be safe in the end, but the most important thing is to take care of yourself and manage your anxiety. Just do things that put you at ease and make you feel happy. Talk to someone you trust, focus on activities that relax you, and delay your second dose if you need to. Your peace of mind is important, don't neglect your feelings. You're going to be fine &lt;3","August 2nd, thank you for those words!

Omg I'm so sorry to hear that! That's so unfortunate. I hope that you get proper treatment and are able to overcome come this. Stay safe!",1
"That is quite normal side effects. They sound like the ones I had after my booster :-) At the end of Day two every side effect was gone. These side effects show that the immune system is working as intended.","I thought so, I was just surprised to hear that it was kind of delayed reaction? For example I had my booster one day at 12pm, by the next morning I woke up early with chills. His reaction is almost 48 hours later!",1
"If you'd like to discuss with other people going through the same issues. A lot of us have long lasting palpitations and chest pain issues continuing many months out, myself almost 6 months since 2 days after my first shot.

"Out of curiosity, what did you think you could pass on to your baby that you are scared about if you got vaccinated?","I'm not even entirely sure. It's a new drug that once you take it you can't go back. What are the long term effects on this? Ive heard things about people's periods being messed up after, I've seen vidoes online of healthy people not being able to function after.My kids are both vaccinated. I am, my hubby is. I'm definitely not anti vax, but with it being new I want to make sure its safe. Everyone says it is but it's so new how do they know it is? Is this still the trial period?",1
"Are you wanting it because it's required to go back to school, or simply because you fear being judged for not having it?If it's required for your school, find another school that doesn't require it or come back later. Do you really want to support a school that's making your health decisions for you with potentially life long consequences?If you fear being judged, that is a ridiculous reason to risk your own health in my opinion. I understand people can be harsh, but stand by what you believe in either way. Don't surround yourself with people who judge you like that, it's terrible for you.I'm assuming, based off your post, you're not wanting to get it just because you feel it is right/want to. Whether you want it or not, stick to what you feel is right for you, and let everyone else do the same.","Well the school is requiring either the vaccine, a negative PCR test every week or a proof of recovery. But unfortunately all the restaurants, gyms, malls, clubs, cafes,… etc are requiring it and since this is gonna be my first semester, I feel like that if I don’t get the vaxx, I won’t be able to go anywhere, therefore I won’t make any friends at all. :/ Ik it’s a risk to take it but it’s also a risk not taking it bc I won’t make friends and since I will be moving to another city for uni too, having 0 friends would probably suck :/",1

"You can think of the mRNA and viral vector vaccines as a platform. Everything remains as is, and only the mRNA or DNA is changed.If you do it like that, you don't really need much clinical studies, as only the instruction to the cell is changed. You will have to show that this leads to an adequate response, but you can do a small study where you look specifically at antibody generation and then show in vitro inhibition of the omicron virus by these antibodies.I think a relatively small phase 1 study and some in vitro and in vivo data whilst referring to the dossier of the original vaccine can be sufficient. Of course, the developers will have a meeting with FDA first to confirm and align.","I understand how it works. Im all for getting it tomorrow, and i believe the people who are making them are competent.But I don't have a lot of faith in bureaucracy, hence the question.  Scientist could have it ready in 2 weeks, but the bureaucracy could take 3 to 12 months to get it approved. And I'd like to know how long would that be. Because if we are constantly in a 12 month offset compared to the virus the lockdowns will never end, and something needs to change.",1

The healthcare system here is amazing, as there’s only been 37 deaths out of 64k cases, so that’s why I fear the vaccine more than the virus. But yes I will talk to my doctor, and I probably will get vaccinated in the end just to return to normal life.",1
"I had a similar experience and skipped the second shot. Don’t listen to the “covid is worse” idiots. There’s no guarantee you will get covid or have a harder time with it versus the vaccine.

"Possibly a coincidental experience , the mRNA vaccine has no link to HSV . It simply doesn’t work that way . All the vaccine does is essentially teaches your body to make a specific immune body to fight off the COVID virus . Both viruses are of a completely different genetic makeup , therefore there should be no link . However , there’s one more theory . The vaccine does cause an immune response and this can flare up your HSV . When your immune system is low , HSV almost always flares up. Immune system keeps it in check. In this case , your immune system was focused on the Covid spike protein antibodies thus giving the chance for HSV to take over . I would prescribe Valtrex 500mg to clear it up","Thanks for the reply! I haven't taken any antivirals yet as my obs were minimal and only caused some discomfort from clothing but if the pattern continues then I will definitely load up on my prescription as my physican did refill my antivirals kind of just curious if they continue monthly or I go back to how I was no obs for years.

I've also started acupuncture this week in an effort to help my body calm down.

"Ummm yes. Count yourself lucky if that's all you get. Jimmy Dore has complained about this exact symptom on his show since getting the fauci jab same with his wife.","Yeah I have other random shit that happens… but they can’t find anything wrong so I get told it’s all in my head….",1
"Also, disclosure, not antivax at all, recently got the HPV vaccine etc. But I don't have the Covid vaccine (yet). I had Covid a few months ago. I have since unknowingly been in contact with positive people with no repercussions. Meanwhile, my sister's partner, and also my cousin, both who are fully vaccinated, currently have Covid.In terms of side effects, I can't speak from experience and everyone I know who got the vaccine are 100% fine, but you do face an increased risk of myocarditis (heart inflammation) if you're a young male, after vaccination. This was even acknowledged by the CDC.","I got Covid form someone who was vaccinated, back in September. No long term problems, except for a slightly disturbed menstrual cycle — which the vaccine seems to cause too.",1
"I’m sorry but when people post good reactions only a day after I don’t think it really helps anyone with a vaccine hesitancy to think they should get it. Post two weeks after, post a month after, but 24 hours, I’m sorry it makes no difference in anyone’s mind. 24 hours a lot of people don’t even have any of the bad side effects until 48 hours.","Happy to keep posting updates on my situation. A lot of my friends were concerned they'd feel bad the next day, so that's why I posted this. I'm now 48 hours later, and my arm sore is gone. Will put more updates in 1 and 2 weeks.",1
"You’re both obese, which is by far the more pressing health concern, but you’re worried about the vaccine? You should prioritize getting vaccinated above all else at this point, because with your significant comorbidity you’re at a disproportionately high risk from delta.","Oh trust me, I’m worried about both. Genetically i carry most of that extra weight in my thighs/butt area and i read its not as unhealthy as stomach fat but i have had some pudge all of my life so definitely trying to work on that. Its so stubborn though <U+0001F972>I want to be at my healthiest when having a baby and want my husband to be as well. Just right now the vaccine is decision i need to make asap. Thanks for your input! Im very much leaning towards getting it. I feel like ill be more at peace once i get past the damn side effect problem.",1
"I get this lately too. I was always cold. I’m not anymore. Although for me it’s not limited to my arm pits. Its like I’m just sweaty all over.","Me too! I got my second Pfizer jab this past Monday and I’m sweating like a MFer. I even typed “Pfizer Vaccine Sweating” into the Reddit search bar to see if anyone had the same side effect. I am still so SO glad I got the vaccines, but this sweating is for the birds. Didn’t start until three days after my second jab.",1
"Just want you to know I’m in the exact same boat. Had covid in October 2020 and still have warped taste buds and feel like I can’t remember anything anymore like I don’t feel like myself. I’m almost the same age as you and worry about what could happen because of how young I am and don’t wanna mess anything else up.. if anyone has any kind of motivation or good experiences to give me a push that would be great. I feel so bad that I’m scared because of the pressure to get it from everyone around me.","My wife and I both had COVID at the same time. I’m 32 and she’s 29. Neither of us had bad symptoms. Mainly cold like symptoms and loss of smell/taste. Our taste and smell came back over time, even though it’s not 100% it’s still much better. Please take care of your mental health first and foremost. Your body can’t fight any sickness, vax or no vax, as well when you’re stressed. Find something like walking, breathing exercises, reading, training, or etc. to take ease your mind. Make decisions when you’re calm, with people you trust, and do what’s best for you. I pray that all goes well for you and stay strong!",1
"(23F) I got my 2nd dose of the AZ vaccine on the 1st of June, so a week ago today, and I've been feeling the same. My first dose was heavier on symptoms but they faded away very fast, but this one is lasting way longer. I still get headaches and feel a little dizzy at times. I called 111 and they said it was normal as long as the symptoms weren't severe, that apparently headaches with AZ are common to last up to a week after vaccination. Now, it's been a week for me, so I'll see how long this lasts, I may have to call again. But I'll keep you updated on that if it can help :)","I'd love that! Thanks. See, i did not come across anywhere saying that lasting headaches are common. Thank you for pointing that out. I'll keep an eye on my symptoms and i'd like to hear from you!",1
"I work in healthcare. FWIW, this is what we're being instructed to do - Booster shots need to be the same brand of the first 2 doses you got. We will be administering flu shots and covid vaccines at the same time if the patient wants it.","Okay cool. Since I’ve now moved would that essentially involve calling around and asking who has which shot available?",1
"Got my booster shot Sat 13th (second shot in April), have sore arm, tiring/foggy feeling in the first 24 hours. The foggy feeling is gone after 24 hours but the arm thing still linger around.Now after more than 72 hours pretty much back to normal .I think I also got low fever and cold feeling during the first 2 shots but not this time.","Hoping I can be that lucky too! Wish me luck! About to get my booster and came here for a pep talk lol!",1
"I completely understand where you’re coming from. I was scared out of my mind of the vaccine and covid too! I’ve heard crazy stories on both ends. I chose the lesser of 2 ‘evils’ if you will. I think we know the dangers of covid pretty clearly now. My ob told me of the rise of mothers losing their babies when getting covid without the vaccine. I’m in a different boat—-I’m pregnant. So the vaccine was the best option for us! I can’t explain the urgency my DR gave me. She witnessed too many losses due to mothers getting covid first hand to not tell me. Babies need as much oxygen as possible to survive. I’m not sure if things would be different if I’d already had the baby. But, I say—talk to your doctor about it. Mine was very clear!","Did you have any side effects to it?",1
"Still have mine its been almost 6 weeks.","When are you getting the ultrasound?",1
"3 months here. MRI and CT scans normal. Neuro said it’s anxiety and occipital neuralgia. The head pressure is causing the ON though.",":((( did they offer to treat it with nerve blocks?",1
"Vertigo post-vaccination appears common. See this forum.","I’ll take a look at this. Does it generally go away?",1
"I’m a relatively healthy 57 yr old woman who got covid last year. It was a mild case. But I ended up in the hospital with mysterious chest pains in December. In February I still couldn’t smell or taste and then for the next 4 months all I smelt was horribly choking imaginary cigarette smoke. It alternately gave me migraines and made me vomit. I continue to have occasional phantom smells, and have the long covid foggy brain and the anxiety and depression that goes along with it. I got one Moderna Shot in April, and one in May. I had a sore arm, both times, for a week after. The first shot I had a low grade fever for 12 hours. The second shot I was merely tired.I said all that to say this: To your inlaws: “I am you. Your peer group. Covid is a risk that you don’t want to take. May be mild, maybe not, but the vaccine was NOTHING compared to an even mild case of the virus. Get the shot. It will take 5 weeks to develop immunity; do you see the transmissions getting better in that time? I don’t. Protect yourselves.","Glad you made ti thru and are still here to give very good advice.  That was a tough journey for sure.",1
"For the love of God don’t do it. I’m in Australia too. I know of 3 people who died of the clot shot. It’s still a experimental vaccine. The Dr who invented mRNA vaccines said DONT ever take it under any circumstances. Your mum sounds beautiful and very respectful of you. I’ve never had any vaccines and I never get sick. It’s all propaganda. I wish you all the best","Do you still believe the same thing? If you don't mind me asking, have you gotten it? With all the restrictions in place does it make it harder for you?",1
"I know someone who had the same issue. They put her on prednisone and basically said she would have to wait until the vaccine works it way out of her system. Could be as long as 6-9 months. Good luck.","I see, thanks for sharing !",1
"It is a no brainer if you've had covid. You don't need the shots. Immunity is lifetime, anyone who says differently ask them why the polio vaccine still works if you got it when you were a child. Also, people who had covid are 2 to 3 times more likely to experience adverse reactions and there are some seriously horrific adverse reactions going on, like death for example. Also, graphene oxide is in the jabs - straight up poison, so there's that also. But you may want to watch this video of a doctor testifying in a senate hearing that natural immunity is real, is better than the jabs and that covid survivors have more reactions to the jabs:","Let's also add that polio was way worse than covid. there are still people living in iron lungs because of polio.",1
"I'm not getting me second dose. I haven't needed a sick day since I started my job in a year and a half untill I got my first dose. I was getting really dizzy, (started 12 hours after I got my shot), out of breath super quick, super high fever (wasn't allowed back at work until it went away, 5 days after my first jab), major brain fog. My job is dangerous so I wasn't allowed to perform my normal duties until the vertigo went away, which took a couple of weeks.","Dang that sucks. I had a mild headache that went away with Advil. Husband got it and hasn’t had any side effects. We got Pfizer.",1
"I used to sleep throughout every night, however after the Moderna vaccine I wake up at least three times per night now been happening for 2 months straight","Mate that's brutal, feel for you. CBD, magnesium, glycine, valerian root helped last night.",1
"Mytocaritis does not only occur after the second.  It's more common, but not exclusive. About 25% of the mitocarditis cases are reported after the first.If you're seeing symptoms, see your doctor.","That would probably be the best move. Thanks for the insight",1
"I’m still not fully recovered from my first dose which I took over 3 months ago- still not a clue what it is. I have muscle pains, weakness, pins and needles, numbness, headaches, heart palpitations, foggy brain- the list goes on. I definitely won’t be my second dose and I don’t think I’ll be able to get medical exception! I’m gonna keep trying with the doctors to find out what it could be, because there is clearly something wrong. Hope everything is well for you guys","OMG sounds exactly like what I experienced. I was prescribed Gabapentin for my pain. However I chose to go the natural route. I did JJ Smith 10 day detox/cleanse 3x’s. I exercised daily, drank lots of water. Last but not least the only thing that helped with the pain is weed.",1
"Hey, I'm not sure that this counts as similar but here's what happened to me:About 12h after my second dose (June 9th) suddenly my heart rate jumped, I started feeling faint and light headed, nauseous, had diahrrea, was covered in sweat almost instantly (no fever), and my legs started twitching. I also had some kind of ""like falling down"" feeling in my chest, sorry I don't know how to describe that better.All of that happened in 20 mins then I felt a bit better and then after 10-20 mins it started again and it hit in waves.I went to the doctor's that evening, they did a basic blood test (all normal), checked my blood pressure (was quite low), gave me an IV with vitamins and something for my stomach and said it was just a reaction to the vaccine.Couple of hours later my vision blurred, wasn't able to see anything closer than 10m properly (I don't have any issues with my vision generally), like my phone was just a blotch of light and colours.I had the above mentioned ""episodes"" throughout the entire night and the blurry vision the entire next day.The next couple of days I didn't have an appetite at all, had a fever (up to 37.5C), lightheadedness, very fatigued, slept half the time and my heart rate would jump ocassionally (but less intensly than the first night).Now I'm pretty much back to normal most of the time, just sometimes I feel lightheaded and I still feel generally tired.Hope you feel better soon.","I had that falling down feeling in my chest from COVID. Funny to see it described so accurately I could never find the words to explain it.",1
"1. Right2. Yes3. Left4. Subclavian lymph nodes on the left side5. Mid-April (1st dose), 2nd dose - May 56. 10 days7. Still enlarged, it’s gone down but I can definitely still feel it8. Right handed","Thank you! Have you had it checked by a doc at this point or still waiting on it to go down? Do you check/touch it a lot? How many nodes?",1
"After my second vaccine a rare side effect for me was tachycardia at some points just standing had me at 150 bpm. It was like 120 bpm sitting. During my 4.5 day hospital stay I had an episode of supraventrical tachycardia (svt) the doctors almost had to defib me they had the crash cart ready but they raised their legs and it went down, my heart rate was like 170+ and all my muscles went dead. If anyone else experiences tachycardia (fast heart rate) i suggest you go to the doctor asap. I'm much better now there was no damage to the heart and no blood clots, the tachycardia has gone away now. Just for reference I'm 24M.","How long it take to go away",1
"I have not experienced this, however I experienced severe fatigue for 2 weeks. It felt as if I could not get out of bed and I thought it would never go away. Thankfuly it did. You are only 6 days into your 2nd dose and seem to have drawn the short stick for severe side effects. I am confident that you will feel better, or atleast somewhat better after another week. Definetely go see your doctor though!","Thank you, I hope so too. My friend has also noticed fatigue for quite a while, I’m glad yours went away!",1
"Does it hurt?","No it doesn't and it is extremlet smaller now than it ever was. No other symptoms just the raised node",1
"I’m 15+ weeks out from my second Moderna shot that caused severe tinnitus, hyperacusis, brain fog, headaches, numbness in extremities, vertigo, fatigue, blurry vision + eye pressure + spots, fluid in ears, and of course a massive dose of anxiety and depression from the non-stop torture, sleep deprivation and unknowns of the whole situation. I was pro-vax, pro-science, just a incredibly unlucky rare case. No secret agenda, not paid to push lies. Just did the right thing by getting the shot, but our lives are now ruined. Those of us suffering just want the medical community and government to acknowledge us, to research these issues and hopefully find some treatment, rather than just sweep us under the rug as ignored collateral damage.","How are you feeling now? Any oscillation in symptoms? Is it constant or up and down?",1
"I could just be your immune response. I’ve had some chest pain on and off since my first dose but not debilitating or anything so I’m not sure what degree is “normal”","I hope it stops soon. I’ve never felt pain like this before in my life…I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. It’s been a week though so i’m losing hope.",1
"I have exactly the same symptoms as you 14 days after my 1st Pfizer dose. Symptoms started about day 3 for me and have stayed quite mild - discomfort around the heart area, some very minor shortness of breath (just not quite feeling like I'm getting a full breath, but only for a few hours every few days). After a week I was concerned enough to go to the Dr, had ECG, blood tests and chest x-rays all of which came back clear/normal. The Dr said this is an uncommon but known side effect and didn't think there was cause for concern, with the usual caveat about coming back if it got worse. He said he didn't see any reason to delay my second dose which is scheduled for 13 Oct. I'm hoping it goes away in the next week or two as I'd feel more comfortable if I'd been clear of symptoms for a couple weeks before my 2nd dose. But apart from being annoying and unsettling it's not really affecting my day to day life.","Any update?",1
"It probably is because of the vaccine. The vaccine has caused inflammation for me as well","Yeah i had unknown bactereal infection for 2 months right after vaccine",1
"Most people have flare ups in first 4 days.","Thanks! What are some of the reported side effects if you know? I got the Pfizer vaccine, any specifics on that?",1
"Sounds exactly like my experience, with the 2nd Moderna jab.   8 hours of fever, chills, arm ached a lot, joint / muscle aches, so bad sleep that night as a result.  Next day a lot of fatigue.  Probably from not sleeping well.   Went back to bed for a nap, since I had a headache.     Late evening I was able to take a short walk and by next day I was pretty much symptom free.","Good to hear no more symptoms, glad to hear it's kinda normal at least haha",1
"Did the pfizer jab affect your endurance? Are you quicker out of breath than before?","Yes to both.",1
"Is there an explanation for myocarditis? Blood clots? How exactly do these occur if the vaccine is supposed to stay in the injection site, the deltoid muscle?","Not saying it's the mechanism with the vaccines, but typically myocarditis is caused by the immune response. You can get myocarditis from having a cold.",1
