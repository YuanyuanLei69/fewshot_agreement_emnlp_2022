"For how long? 2 weeks?","It lasts for at least 8 months, that’s already been proven, it just doesn’t have sterilizing immunity and/or high antibody counts which is what some of these tests are after.

There’s no decided standard on what we are even after here, short term sterilized immunity with many boosters, long term immunity with cold like breakthroughs? There’s really no consensus. Plus many of these tests are improperly weighted since they often start at 14 days out and it’s known this vaccine doesn’t do its best until 58 days. Also the lower antibody higher B/T cell response favors those with good immune systems to begin with but is probably not best for immunocompromised seniors. Once you start expanding time ranges and age groups it’s efficacy is pretty much identical to its phase 3 trial numbers.Given the side effects of all these vaccines it should be given primarily to younger males where it would have most efficacy and not have the myocarditis risk.

"I've seen people here on reddit post how they got infected after having had covid previously and gotten both vaccines.

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again. The reason I think this is because immunity from prior infection is proving to be much better than immunity from the vaccines. And when you take the vaccines, you override your prior immunity with the immunity provided by vaccination. Just a theory, but I think that will end up being true.","Not how that works at all. Your body doesn't ""override"" previously acquired immunity. It does eventually forget about it, if you don't keep encountering the same virus in the environment though, and the vaccine is a new encounter, reminding your body to re-up it's commitment to looking for that virus. We don't have good long term evidence yet as to what immunity remains after a year or more, because the virus hasn't been around long enough to do those studies, but every bit of previous experience we have with viruses and vaccines is that the effect is additive. Vaccines improve and extend your natural immunity.",0
"You don't. Asking this question shouldn't be so normalized. Since both parties can spread the virus it shouldn't make a difference.","Walking around w/out regard for protecting not only ourselves and our loved ones, but all those around us, *during a pandemic*, shouldn't be normalized.And as we are seeing, ithe world over,  the behavior of ""no regard for others"" has only been  normalized in small percentages by certain cult segments of the population.Watching South Dakota covid cases go up 456%  (!!!!) after Sturgis, for instance, would be a  cautionary tale to most  thinking persons and most of us  feel bad for the health care workers there who will surely be over-burdened and stressed by this.",0

I did do a lot of research and thinking about whether or not to get vaccinated.

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again.

If the vaccine doesnt prevent getting the virus nor the spread, if it just decreases the severity of the symptoms of COVID then how is it exactly stopping it?

The government purchased them. All governments purchased them in order to save lives and money. It’s hard to be a government when it’s not functioning and people are dying.","Government health departments were responsible for reviewing and promoting them. It IS a ""government thing"".

They invested hundreds of billions in procuring and promoting these products. They are very much invested.",0
"I understand that blood clots can happen if the nurse doing the vaccine doesn't aspirate and the vaccine gets in the vein and in the blood stream. If they aspirate, they can be sure that vaccine will be done in the muscle and not in the vein.","This is a hypothesis. Maybe even a reasonable one but it's not a fact that one should claim to 'understand'.Even if the hypothesis is valid, it's likely that the method of injection works shift the risk profile up or down but not nessesarily eliminate it.",0
"I was so scared too, especially cause I have a one year old but then as things haven't gotten better I made the decision to get it to keep me and my kid safe. Most of my family are antivaxxers and think it's a mind control or something crazy... I got my last shot in October and I'm totally fine. My mom is also allergic is iodine and I am slightly. My only reactions were sore arm after the first one and then a headache and being tired after the second.","You won't be safe from the ""pandemic"" which is not a threat but now you are in harm's way from government and big pharma.

Risk assessment has been totally put out of whack from the steady propaganda bombardment",0
"No, not possible.","Thank you, can i ask you why not?",0
"It’s in your head, sweety. Can’t relate. Covid vaccine ruined my Sunday once that how bad it was, and my Sunday is a huge fucking deal. “Very sore arm”, hope what you wrote here comes true for you. Crossing fingers and crampy toes.","I was looking for advice not for snarky comments thanks",0
"It should be. The more this goes on the more I think they need to start drawing antibodies on everyone and see who really needs it, and who doesn’t? People that have had Covid, then vaccinated, do they really need a booster? There are so many variables and I think it would help determine the actual needs, who needs it more etc. I’m sure the pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t like it if it was determined a lot less was needed etc.","It certainly helps your business when the government mandates a large group of people to use your product...

There is evidence that suggests natural immunity is actually better than vaccination due to an immune response to more parts of the virus than just the spike. The thing with testing for antibodies is that it's a whole process and it's much easier financially and logistically to just jab everybody, even if it is not necessary to do so. That doesn't mean that they should bar the people who don't want to do it from testing out. Perhaps making testing more accessible and realistic is something the government should spend some of our tax money on.",0
"If you don’t want the vaccine for your own health, get it for humanity.. each time someone gets COVID, there is a chance it will mutate. Just get it already!","Yeah this is asinine. Vaccinated spread this virus by thinking they can go live a life of 2018 or before. The virus stays in a vaccinated body and mutates.",0
"VAERS is interesting but the data is unverified. It's basically the vaccination version of food frequency questionnaires used in almost every nutritional epidemiological study. Basically you have to trust people not to lie or embellish the truth.","I'm not saying go get your information from it. I'm saying report your adverse events if you have any. All reports are followed up and verified. Also it's a federal crime to lie. Like on your taxes or when you're applying for government assistance. People can lie on those too, yet that information is also used for research.Why do people have such a problem with putting this out there?",0
"Are you sure that the IUD is still in place? A hormonal IUD lasts 3 to 7 years depending on the brand. You should talk to your OB/gyn.","I'm sure and have felt the strings, my brand lasts 4 years before the effectiveness starts to decrease.",0
"I took the same.","In India? I thought we are only getting covishield and covaxine.",0
"I had sore arm first couple days. Then went away but now all of a sudden a month later I'm feeling it again too","This comment is from someone with little to no Reddit history. This is a fake. This is really obvious.",0
"They never found spike protein in the ovaries. They found radiation in mice from a radioactive mRNA lipid test. Guess what? Radiation tends to accumulate in the ovaries. Shocker. They did not see luciferase expression in ovaries in mice dosed with a luciferase mRNA.","False.",0
"Just take it, worst thing that can happen is you die","if dying, it would still be okay.what if never die but suffered problems like disability , lower body paralyzed, blind etc. if the other only worst possible outcome was death I am sure a lot of people wouldn't mind.",0
"Over half the people in some of the vaccine test groups did not have side effects, yet their protection was tested to be the same as those who did. Side effects or not is random and not an indication of vaccine efficacy. Nothing to worry about.","I have armwrestling tournament next week I can’t afford to have a sore arm from the vaccine.  I’ll wait.",0
"Less than 1/4 of population of people 20 years old and younger when they catch Covid actually get sick enough to be in Hospital. Most just get sniffles. That’s the Number. I got the J+J vaccine only because it’s not really experimental, they been giving it to US military for over 20 years .","Less than 1/4? It's less than 5% population wide that end up in hospital and almost exclusively confined to chronically ill elderly persons.

There is no logical reason for a 19 year old to take an experimental injection.",0
"Why","You win the award for most helpful person",0
"Theory: vaccinated people are more likely to get tested for covid if they are sick bc they believe the virus is real and want to protect others. Too many people are so in denial I can’t stand it. Two people I know from my gym have come in sick for over a week instead of staying at home. Their excuse “I’m not really sick I just have the crud”. Covid or not if you’re sick stay home!! You don’t need to go to the gym or target.","I dont know if that theory is solid. In many countries vaccinated people assume they are completely immune from the disease and don’t have to test to get into places or travel. Unvaccinated peopleHave to do more tests to work, travel, etc",0
"I don't know if it would be dangerous (not a doctor... duh)   I do remember one or two cases where people received overdoses of the vaccine accidentally.Most likely you will have the potential for increased side effects and complications - and - I doubt your immunity would be any better than if you had gotten a single shot.  Part of the two shot regimen is to allow time for your body to generate the necessary response.Bottom line - I would do it because it likely won't be any more effective than a single shot and increases your risk of complications.","no",0
"How I interpret this is that I am careful with where I go and unmask. ( I wear kn95s or kf94s) Like, it has to be a very special occasion. I am not going to unmask just going to the store. Also, I rarely eat out, again, it has to be a very special occasion. It's going to take time for me to get comfortable routinely unmasking.","Then don’t.",0
"Your age range and gender have a lot of major side effects particularly myocarditis with RNA vaccine. If you ask me, go for J&amp;J but of course the decision will always be yours. Do what you think is best for you.","Can you define a “lot”? Link to data supporting this claim?",0
"The vaccines don't even work bro. If they worked why would we need booster shots and why would we need to continue wearing masks. If you don't wanna take it; don't take it. Tell your peers to leave you alone.","We need booster shots because there are variants. Just like the flu shot updates it’s shots every year.

We need to continue to wear masks because we have no yet reached herd immunity because so many of you won’t get the vaccine. AND because children cannot get vaccinated yet and we want them to be safe.",0
"One can kill you, the other can't.One causes documented long term damage, the other is a vaccine to prevent it.It's a simple choice if you're a data driven person. You'll get the vaccine if you are.","Has no one died from the vaccine?",0
"shut up and get it.","yes, don't think! just do as you're told you morons!! get a free donut for being a good tax cattle",0
"I think anyone who would base a decision about their own safety and health on resentment about being told what to do, is emotionally a child, and has a lot of growing up to do, regardless of the number of times they’ve been around the sun. I don’t want to insult you, but how bullied or pressured you feel about it has no bearing on whether it’s a smart choice for YOU. If you end up with it, with complications or serious illness, or end up infecting someone vulnerable and killing them, do you think it will matter to you one bit that you stood up to the pressure and didn’t get vaccinated?

Real maturity and strength lies in making good choices and doing the best for yourself and people you care about, regardless of peer pressure either way.","You can still be infected and spread the virus even if you’ve been vaccinated. Vaccination prevents severe illness, especially in people with comorbidities, The only ones you’re saving when you get vaccinated are yourself and the healthcare system. Vaccinated people are just as high risk to infect someone vulnerable as unvaccinated people are.",0
"Have you gone to the doctor? Do not assume it is the cause without first going to the doctor. It’s dangerous because something else may be wrong. It also might be easily fixed.","Dont assume? It happened after the vaccination, and it never happened before, do you really think that’s just a coincidence",0
"Not everything's caused by the vaccine, like physically on might have heightened anxiety and fatigue but some days I go for vaccines after I've had bouts with the blood pressure machine and unusual situations whether it's dental or with the gynecologist. It's actually kind of funny because they're all in the same building. I just go downstairs if I want to vaccine, if I can get the vaccine.","I am pretty sure that the tinnitus like symptoms are listed as a side effect. This is also not the first report i have read of that symptom occuring after vaccination.",0
"This is a Canadian vaccine ?","Nope! Based in Maryland, USA",0
"My God, I hear about chest pain so much. No fucking way I'm taking the shot","Catch Covid you’ll get 5x the risk of the worst vaccine side affects.",0
"Had my 6 month Moderna booster on Monday (3rd shot)…definitely made me more tired and achey, but my measured Covid antibodies were OK before the shot (via blood test), so feeling great that likely no Actual, life threatening Covid, ahead. Can’t imagine being not being vaxxed at this point anywhere in the USA…suicidal!","Lol suicidal. You know 98% of people survive COVID. And if you had antibodies, that means you have natural immunity. You really shouldn’t be posting about something you clearly know nothing about. That also has nothing to do with the question this person asked. You’re a very bright person",0
"Well there's a couple of factors to consider. Number one, catching the virus is not a definitive antibody certainty, while the vaccine is. Also, you have to keep in mind that even though you're unlikely to catch it again, if you do you can partly contribute to the possibility of an evolution of a new variant which could ultimately cancel out and the antibodies you or anyone else has from either vaccine or infection. Basically, it doesn't matter if you've gotten the virus before or not, get the vaccine.","Yea I can just make up random shit too",0
"You're brainwashed. If you're scared of tiny percentages, then why aren't you scared of the big percentages of the nasty effects a rough bout with covid will certainly cause you?I know 3 healthy people (unvaccinated of course) that have died from covid. I have yet to know anyone that has had an issue wit the vaccine besides a sore arm.  I think there are about 3 deaths TOTAL (and all 3 were women with a very rare blood disorder) linked to the vaccine out of 8 Billion doses.  You'd have better odds of winning the powerball lotto twice than having a bad vaccine reaction you're scared of.","Don’t get me wrong, i know 5 ppl that died from covid. All from my family. Soo i know what you’re saying trust me. Still i have fear for both of them.",0
"This is a documentary vice did about the link between periods and the covid vaccine. People that are saying there is no link are clueless and haven’t did their research, and now there are doctors saying the spike proteins may collect in the ovaries which is causing these problems and complications. I’m not so sure about fertility however but the effect on periods makes me cautious myself as a young female.","A temporary change in a period is not an indicator for infertility.

And no, debunked doctors are spouting misinformation about spike proteins. All the other doctors know that the spike proteins stay around the muscle and are completely gone within two weeks.",0
"All the studies show that the 3rd shot appears to have equal to or smaller side effects compared to the 2nd shot. After my 2nd shot, I had a brain fog for 24 hours. I'd rather take that then have flu-like symptoms for 3-4 days. Also, I can pick my vaccine date. Like, I can decide I'll have my vaccine on a Friday, so I can recover over the weekend. With Delta, I don't have that choice. So yeah, boosters all the way!","How many boosters will be your limit? 1, 2, 10?",0
"I tried this on my wife and it worked.  Thing is, she isn't vaccinated. Get a penny and push it against your arm, it will stick. Rubber will stick the most. I don't know if you are catching my drift here. Also, there isn't enough mass in the vaccine to make things stick to it. Even if it had dissolved  iron in it.","I’m sorry, but I don’t follow. Could you elaborate some more please?",0
"Firstly there is a persistent group on here questioning efficacy against Delta. Don't listen to them. In the UK vaccinations are extremely effective against Delta. Our infection rates are dramatically decreasing and our hospitalisation and death rates are incredibly low.Virtually all if our infections are Delta. The only people generally dying are the unvaccinated.Just get the vaccine.UK Astra Zeneca vaccinated my extended family are all  Phizer vaccinated. Absolutely no problems just mild symptoms short term. Two of my relatives have heart and blood clotting problems and they are fine. They had the jabs 3 months ago. We can all hug each other and life us back to normal. Amazing stuff.","Lol. Authorities have made astrazeneca illegal in many eu countries because of thrombosis. You are lying out of your teeth. it's even forbidden in mine if you are under 55 years old.",0
"The vaccine does not necessarily prevent you from getting covid. It prevents you from having severe illness and keeps you out of the hospital. If you already had mild covid why do you need the vaccine?","1. To reduce the chances of spreading it to someone it *could* kill.2. To reduce the chances of getting sick from a variant which could potentially be worse.3. Because immunity caused by the vaccine lasts longer.",0
"If the vaccines are so safe, why are more people dying and having severe adverse reactions than the last 30 years of vaccine data combined?","We have vaccinated more people this year than in any other year at all ages. Guess what? Some people die every single day. There's going to be overlap. What hasn't happened is an increase in excess deaths.",0
"I had 2 friends (unvaccinated) spend 8 days in Florida 2 weeks ago. They didn't catch Rona. Maybe you are being a little paranoid.","That’s not how statistics work at all champ",0
"I’m fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I received moderna and developed disequilibrium a few days after my second dose. It’s been 5 months and it still comes and goes. Have 3 friends with the same issue after moderna. Maybe it’s unrelated. But I really doubt it.","Is that better than the possibility of getting covid and having a 99% survival rate? I'm very serious, if that's what is happening currently with you, do you fear long term issues because of the shot?",0
"Of course. Point? No one ever said it is 100% effective. Yeah, don't wear seat belts or a helmet because some people die wearing them. Brilliant","Totally not the same. I understand your point though. And again...how can someone think they can mandate it? Because they can't. And 2nd, it's definitely not 100% effective because vaccinated can still get covid and they can still pass it on. And another thing...t delta variant didn't exist until people started getting vaccinated...not saying it's the vaccine..just pointing it out. And sure...things evolve. Just...again...doesn't make sense. Especially when the source and stories and recommendations have changed quite a few times.",0
"Never. You're the test group.","Bullshit. Your body has fully cleared the vaccin within weeks. Stop fearmongering.",0
"Go see a cardiologist and see what you can do to prevent blood clot prior to the vaccine","Not taking the injection would be the best bet. 100% risk reduction.",0
"Yes, the vaccine is safe for you! Covid-19 is not safe for you. If you currently have cancer or are receiving radiation, there is some evidence that you might have a weakened response to two vaccines. A weak immune system is one of the BEST reasons to get vaccinated, not forego the vaccine","Lol this is so cringe. It’s like you don’t even understand what you are saying.",0
"It's obvious why the rotavirus vaccine is relevant to this topic. Tell me why it's not relevant. I gave you the details as to why it's relevant. If you don't know why your claim that it's irrelevant is true then don't say it.","You tell me why it is. Its not even in the same family as coronaviruses and it affects only a specific age group, children.
