"Objectlivly your vaccinations are not protective of you or those around you when you get Covid, which, likely you will.   Use prophylatic neutraceuticals such as niger sativa (black cumin), quercetin, zinc, magnesium, melatonin, Vitamins D3 and K2, B vitamin complex, vitamin C in time release every day.   Look up the reccommended nasal washes (spray or drip), and gargle with a protective mouthwash.

I can't get the vaccine because of allergy issues and EVERYONE I know has been vaccinated and, despite my health issues, I am receiving a lot of pressure to get the vaccine!  People who I thought would be supportive have been very judgemental, totally dismissing the possiblity that I might have an allergic reaction to the vaccine, and it has been terrible.  We all must be able to listen to our intuition and our health professionals who we trust to decide whether to get the vaccine or not.  I 100% respect people for getting the vaccine and I 100% respect people who choose not to get the vaccine.  It isn't a moral issue, particulary because I am taking all the precautions I have for the past year so I am not out there infecting other people.  It is a real pitty that this has become so politized.  I think we just have to wait it out and eventually there will be something else everyone is polarized over.

"I have lupus (not on any medications/steroids/immune suppressants) and since receiving my 2nd dose in April I have experience chronic maintenance insomnia and believe I may be developing severe arthritis +I'm 32 yo woman active and great metabolic health, otherwise). My reaction to the vaccine was pretty severe and I have felt off ever since. I was pro vaccine initially but given the long term side effects I've experienced and the new ""mandates"" I choose to not be further injected. Us autoimmune folk already have hyper sensitive immune systems and it seems that the vaccine has ramped up painful symptoms for me, body aches, joint pain, severe fatigue, and chronic swollen lymph nodes. I was 90% functional prior to vaccine using AIP/GF diet and now I seem to be symptomatic regardless of food choices. This is my experience, and mine alone. Everyones immune system is unique but I'd ask yourself if you really think you are at high risk for Covid (are you metabolically unhealthy? Overweight? Hypertensive?).

I scroll through TikTok (which reads your subconscious somehow) and see people literally hating soo hard on a statistic of people unvaccinated, knowing nothing about the people, themselves.

"There are studies showing that zinc can help with tinnitus if there is a zinc deficiency present. Studies saw improvement at 50mg a day. It’s worth a try, maybe something in the vaccine depletes zinc and over time it slowly rebuilds in the system... hence people’s experience with it ending.","To little magnesium and b12 als might be a factor that increases it",2
"Same. I personally just dont feel comfortable getting it because there is not enough peer reviewed data for the long term effects of this vaccine for me to feel like I made a informed decision. I wish that was respected. I already had COVID and I barely had symptoms. So I feel comfortable risking not getting vaccinated. If the vaccine doesnt prevent getting the virus nor the spread, if it just decreases the severity of the symptoms of COVID then how is it exactly stopping it? Why is it that vaccinated people feel like they are all of a sudden invincible? Especially with these new variants. It sucks that if I ask questions all of a sudden people make it seem like I'm stupid. I work in Neurology and I've seen alot of people having post covid vaccine related issues. Mostly neuropathy, but it has also triggered autoimmune diseases in others. This is all anecdotal but I see enough of it to question getting it.","exactly if everyone who gets the vaccine has lessened symptoms then what does it matter if I don’t get it. “You could spread it to other people”, well if those other people choose to be vaccinated then there is no harm and we wait until there is herd immunity. A few years down the road when it is researched more I would gladly get the vaccine.",2
"NZ’s Government medication safety monitoring division, Medsafe, have admitted that “menstrual disorder” may be a side effect (“safety signal”) of the Pfizer covid vaccine, among others, although they are also still marketing the Pfizer vaccine as “safe and effective”. One of Nz’s leading lawyers (who also has a degree in biochemistry and microbiology) has called nz’s vaccine reporting system a “secretive, flawed and very passive official post jab injury reporting process”, so in this context, I would assume that these “menstrual disorders” must be a major problem for them to have now listed it as something they are at least acknowledging that people are taking the time to report.

It's not fully overrun with them but if you turn on the option to display the red cross symbol next to controversial comments (comments with near equal up and down votes), you'll see it often seems like more than half the comments in threads have that symbol no matter what (say something favorable to getting vaccinated, they downvote it while those who favor vaccines upvote and vice versa).

"If you’re so knowledgeable, you probably know that a naive covid infection is very different that a breakthrough one, and that the latter is much more likely to be “like the flu.” You also probably know that the challenge to the immune system presented by covid itself can trigger an autoimmune issue as well. I know someone whose father got Pyoderma Gangreosum after covid, for example. In general, if you’re coming up with criteria that are impossible to meet, even in the face of both clinical trials that involved tens of thousands of people and massive real-world studies in many countries, you should ask yourself if you’re really just looking for reasons not to get the vaccine.","Yo it’s just an anti Vaxer spreading bs.",2
"Glad you got it and be sure to take it easy! Don't forget the risk of myocarditis is higher from actual infection than from the vaccine, and not knowing when an infection could hit would be super stressful to me as a fellow anxiety sufferer.","Yes, agreed!

"A few days after seems unlikely to be caused by the shot. Most allergic reactions are pretty immediate. Is there anything environmental?

I moved since I got the second shot and still have the same issues.",2
"Best of luck, I honestly hope things bode well for you, especially since you were pressured by your job. I personally do not use any of the monopolized media's made up/and or recycled c0mmunism terms such as ""vaccine hesitant"", or, ""misinformation"".

And all I've read from forums, although admittedly anecdotal, paints a picture much different than what we hear from the media and ""experts."" It's like a new command could come down from the media and an army of automatons parrot what they say and scorn anyone who simply asks rational questions. For example, a friend and I asked about 12 women we know who got vaccinated if they had side effects with their menstrual cycles and most of them (8) said yes. Of course this is a localized example, but even taken as a conservative representation, it's obvious that that experience would replicate to some degree across the population. Anyway, I'm just tired of all the bs.",2
"I'm with you on this. Not anti Vax. I just don't trust putting something in my body that hadn't been tested long enough and effects everyone different.  Not to mention you can still get it and pass it on . And they are saying you still have to wear masks and social distance. That right there tells me theses vaccinating are being tested on those taking it and they have no guarantee of its effectiveness or side effects. Not to mention the long term effects. I'm on the fence whether I will get it. Holding out as long as I can to see what goes down. Plus it's the principle of the whole thing. Being forced or my freedoms are taken awsy.. I don't trust these circumstances.","You are in a very big boat, She-She. Hundreds of thousands of good, responsible people are terrified to gamble with the side effects. The effects are dire and in many cases, permanent. However, people feel increasingly cornered, isolated and condemned. It’s hard to take. Moreover, the “medical system” is bamboozled by the effects and.......is not sufficiently knowledgeable or prepared to do much about them. I shouldn’t write this here. My basic position is that vaccines are good and necessary. However, this speedily and competitively produced product has made trillions for the right people, and, were I able to, I would demand (used to be considered reasonable) a precise, scientific explanation of its efficacy, even safety in the short and long term. In the next breath? I say, “Get it and cross your fingers”. And await the next one. I understand your fear and your dilemma. Would love you to follow up in the near future and let us know how both shots affected you. Also, remember. You are not alone....... Very few (in real life, not on TV) went in with joyful enthusiasm.

"First of, it's impossible for it to enter your dna. I was anxious about the vaccine too, but so far people seem absolutely fine on a global scale. Covid can give long term damage, for certain. So i rationalized that i was better off trusting science(after all, doctors and politicians are getting the shot) than taking my chances with covid. Yes a very small minority might be worse off, but that goes for any vaccine. In terms of long term damage, i only remember swine flu vaccine giving a very small minority of children narcolepsy, which is of course horrible, but again, a very small minority. You should never take any info from crazy anti vaccine people, they rarely, if ever, have their facts straight.

There are other risks associated with Covid so vaccination still makes sense but you should be aware of these risks since you are in this higher risk group.Also note that myocarditis from infection may be worse than vaccination. I'm personally still not clear on this or if this statement doesn't account for covid myocarditis happening in more unhealthy patients. Either way can't comment on this part with as much certainty but also something to keep in mind","I live in a US City where they bought a large volume of Pfizer doses.

My appt (the soonest available) is in 10 days and I’m just doing it bc I guess it’s the lesser evil— especially seeing that I live in Miami where it’s spreading like wildfire. Hopefully I don’t catch it before getting the vax","I'm in Broward same boat as you, I'm still freaked out but I got my 1st dose of pfizer on Fri. My heart was racing off and on that night, body felt sore and fatigued and my brain felt like it was pulsating. Sat sore arm and today headache. I'm not looking forward to the 2nd dose.",2
"Every unvaccinated group is a breeding pool for mutant viruses. If we don’t vaccinate kids, it will put evolutionary selection pressure towards new mutants that actually *do* spread efficiently through kids. The couple of cases I’m aware of of people who had been vaccinated  but then still got covid, got it from their kids (kid seemed to just have mild cold, very close contact with kid = very high viral doses delivered, apparently enough to overpower vaccine protection.","Every single virus mutates. That’s what viruses do.",2
"“We will compensate you but only if you stayed in the hospital overnight.”I mean ... good that they’re doing this at all I guess, but what a way to weed a bunch of vaccine-injured people out of eligibility from the start.","That's crazy!  The vast majority of people I read about with severe adverse effects have lots of tests but don't stay in the hospital unless it's a bad heart condition!  It does sound like a big ""weeding out"" effort; shameful!",2
"""Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate.""The fact that the moderators can ban people from certain subs because of differing viewpoints/opinions means this statement is pure bullshit.","Exactly. Awkward the turtle exists on reddit. Argument destroyed.",2
"I have it.  It’s called Allodynia.  I had my last shot on May 18th.  It’s a very weird sensation.  It has lessened but not gone away. I have lots of inflammation in my body.  Take care.","Agreed. It's very weird!Thank you for the name for it. I will Google it.",2
"My SO got swollen lymph nodes after their second shot and pretty much just ignored them as much as possible. They went back to normal about 3-5 days. I guess they didn't bother much? But doc said to use a warm compress if they did. (Damp towel dipped in hot water.) And to rest/sleep.","Thank you! It’s feeling a little better this morning thankfully, I’ll try the warm compress later today",2
"Four rather  obvious conclusions about the vaccines:1. the creators of the vaccines didn't really know what they might do to people, in widespread use;2. the doctors don't know how to deal with the side effects, as they had no direction from the vaccine creators;3. medical science is currently studying effects in the population, in order to determine what they will do and how to treat them.4. This is not how we usually do things.","Couldn't agree more sadly. It's why hubs and I aren't participating in the grand experiment. We're taking our chances with nutrition, heavy supplements and homebrewed elderberry syrup taken daily.",2
