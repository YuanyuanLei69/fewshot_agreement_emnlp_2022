It’s already crazy insanely easy to catch, it’s even way easier for someone with a suppressed immune system.","I extremely doubt anyone on immune-suppressants have taken the vaccine.Her doctor said that in order to take the vaccine she would have to be off her medication for a minimum of 18 days, then the entire time between shots. That is not an option for us, as 3+ weeks of debilitating pain and being immobile is not an option.",0
"I know a lot of people who are just so scared of it because of all the misinformation and fake stories that have gone around on social media (Facebook is especially cancerous). Then after being mandated to get the vaccine their anxiety was at an all time high. I feel like they are making themselves sick with worry. I've been vaccinated (Pfizer) since March and never had more than a little bit of a sore arm and some slight sleepiness. I know everyone is different, and I'm glad I didn't have any difficulty, but I really think people's fears and anxieties are making it worse on them.","There are also those of us who haven’t gotten it because we’re just not around people and couldn’t be bothered. I live in the middle of nowhere. The only people I’ve come into contact with was to get the vaccine. Now ironically, I have to come into contact with more people to investigate what’s wrong with me now… something I really wasn’t looking forward to, and investigating it is proving to be a waste of time because the first 5-6 kicks at that can are dismissed as being anti or hesitant or scared or stressed lol… sorry, not your fault, just venting.

Now, I get that you’re an adult. So if you don’t want to get it, don’t. But we’re nearly 2 years into this and Covid nor it’s variant seem to be slowing down despite how much research comes out. People are tired of losing those they love and just seeing people die from this thing in general when it’s avoidable to a high degree.

Sit down with them, explain your decision, allow them to really listen and then you do the same. Come to a conclusion that way. With adults it usually becomes a competition of who’s right and wrong and blah blah blah but have a real conversation with them.

And some studies suggest that after around 6 months without being infected from the Alpha variant, your chance of immunity drops to 50%. The mRNA vaccines are showing roughly 80–85% effectiveness.
