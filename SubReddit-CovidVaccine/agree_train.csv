"You aren’t the only one. I’m in the military and am still on the fence about this whole thing. I either get it or face a discharge. The lack of long term studies as well as reading and personally knowing people getting side effects is what’s stopping me. The science may be there but I’d be pretty pissed getting a serious side effect such as myocarditis from something that was forced. I had covid 3 weeks ago and had no symptoms, as well as no lingering side effects from it. My natural immunity as well as staying in pretty decent health is also what deterring me. Maybe I’m lucky.","Don't give in. There is going to be a major plot twist soon that will cancel this whole forced vaccine thing.",2
"We should have a recovery thread pinned lol","That would be nice",2
"I wish the conversations were more open and welcoming. I personally have not gotten the vaccine and I’m not exactly planning to. I don’t have extremely strong opinions against it or for it. But I do wish we could all talk about it in this way rather than being condescending and such, and being labelled dumb, ignorant, “anti-vaxxer”,etc. Everyone should be able to do their own research and talk to each other openly and make their decision without being bribed or pressured into it. Thank you for starting this thread!","Same. I personally just dont feel comfortable getting it because there is not enough peer reviewed data for the long term effects of this vaccine for me to feel like I made a informed decision. I wish that was respected. I already had COVID and I barely had symptoms. So I feel comfortable risking not getting vaccinated. If the vaccine doesnt prevent getting the virus nor the spread, if it just decreases the severity of the symptoms of COVID then how is it exactly stopping it? Why is it that vaccinated people feel like they are all of a sudden invincible? Especially with these new variants. It sucks that if I ask questions all of a sudden people make it seem like I'm stupid. I work in Neurology and I've seen alot of people having post covid vaccine related issues. Mostly neuropathy, but it has also triggered autoimmune diseases in others. This is all anecdotal but I see enough of it to question getting it.",2
"That's great! My whole family had no side effects with the Pfizer vaccine except for me. Regardless, it's good to share all perspectives!","Most of my wife's family had covid without side effect. Since we are posting positive stories, I figured I'd share that.",2
"It is so fucking frustrating whenever there is data like this they NEVER break down on what vaccines they got. JJ people are like waiting for a potential terrible news that may or may not be true","I was basically ridiculed at work for asking people which vax they got because I haven’t got one yet.“They’re all the same so it doesn’t matter, just get one”",2
"Holding out for Novavax. I sure hope I don't fall under a mandate before them. I don't trust the companies behind the currently available vaccines.","Nor do I.",2
"Same here. I took one dose of moderna but I’m super nervous about it. Idk what is safe bc they all honestly have some side effects. Maybe talk to your doctor. I think Novavax will be out soon. Seems to have a safer profile.","I want to add that it’s frustrating that there isn’t a vaccine that is ideal for people with cardiovascular disease but the current ones. If you are on meds then you might be ok but I am not and my bp spiked to 169/90! I’m not sure if it was the vaccine but I’m scared bc there are a lot of people experiencing this and high heart rate. When choosing a vaccine make sure it is one that is safe for your particular health history. I did not know Moderna was the most potent of them all. I am going to my doctor on Monday to talk with her about gradual dosing or maybe switching up.",2
"You are lucky to have seen the side effects of this thing first hand. These cases & the side effects in general are being downplayed to a laughable extent. Stay far away from this jab if you value your health.","Careful! The mods do not like people with common sense in here.",2
"That’s fascinating to me. There’s a tendency to assume that all vaccinated people are pro-vaccine and all unvaccinated people are anti-vaccine. But your experience suggests that there’s also vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated people.","The pro-vaxx and anti-vaxx controversy is stupid imho.  A lot of people have had very mild course of the disease and say, what is the fuss? Should I take a vaccine against every cold I may get? Others have seen friends and relatives die and take the vaccine because they don't want to experience that. Risk perceptions are shaped by these personal experiences. Governments treat this as the most important challenge in decades, but for many people is just another problem in their already troubled lives.",2
"The Japanese have been instructed to closely monitor the vials for contaminants. Some people had already gotten this one by the time they noticed though. I wonder if we are doing this in the US? Very concerning. They state here as well that they think it’s some kind of metal, because it was attracted with a magnet.","This is the interesting sentence to me... ""these vials were made using the same production line at the factory during the same period.""  So somehow a certain percentage were contaminated with heavy metals without the process changing at all.  I wonder if there's foul play involved here.  Also, why haven't we found heavy metals in the shots anywhere else in the world?  Are they even being tested or is Japan the only country that gives enough shits about their people to do the appropriate level of testing to get these findings?",2
"My friend from college has had mild arthritis in his hands for about 4 years. He got the COVID vaccine and the booster last fall and winter. Now, his arthritis has affected his legs and he can barely walk without a cane. I don't know if this is connected to the vaccine, but it seems a little suspicious to me.","it is, I've read so many of these stories and that is def one ive seen over again",2
"I am a statistician and I understand that events that occur in sequence(in this case, getting the Covid vaccine and then diagnosed of blood cancer) doesn’t prove causal relationship. The gold standard clinical trial is unquestionably the only way to prove causal relationships.

That said, given more than 65% of US adult population fully vaccinated, it is a given that events similar to this post should have happened. After doing some keywords searching on Google, strangely, there is no mainstream media(neither liberal or conservative) coverage. So here is my conspiracy that editors at both liberal and conservative media chose not to cover these type of stories with different motivations obviously.

It would be of interest to me to find out whether social media such as Reddit would censor posts like this one (either by their algorithms or human reviews) as private internet companies have rights to censor opinions without legal due process.","that is my thought exactly. thank you.",2
"Bro I got the Moderna shot but not delusional enough to say I loved it. Fucking sucks. Having full body aches rn and I feel so weak and frail.","That’s what I’m saying. Red my text",2
"Congratulations! I was extremely anxious getting my second shot. I got it just this Sunday the 13th. Got it at 11am. Sore arm later that day. Monday I felt a little achey and fatigued but nothing unbearable. Today I feel good as new! Hope everything goes smoothly for you!","Thanks for saying that, I have my second one in a few weeks and have been nervous about it since everyone says you get really sick after it! I only had sore arm for a day after the 1st",2
"Why are you getting downvoted is beyond me. I'm happy everything worked out for you! As it did for the vast majority of people!","Everything that isn’t bad news gets downvoted here it seems, but hey ho!",2
"Pregnant women are dropping like flies from COVID. Get vaccinated before you regret it.","And their babies. Please get it. I have like three friends who got while pregnant and have happy healthy babies. Please, please, please get it. People are literally just making shit up online. Your wife will not have a spontaneous abortion from the vaccine.",2

Thank you for starting this thread!","Same! I really don’t care one way or the other. While I was a little skeptical about how fast they became available, I decided the best decision for me was to wait and see. The constant pressure from the government and immediate politicization of it all, plus the removal of people with the credentials to talk about this stuff has turned me off to it a little more.

It just feels like it’s an effort to make the current administration look really good and to make a lot of money. It feels like that has become more important to them than actually making sure people have the tools to fight covid if they come down with it",2
"Take the vaccine. Give doctors and hospitals the break from having to treat you. They are literally begging people to take it because of how sick the unvaccinated are. It’s not a matter of if but when you catch Delta. As the cdc said, it’s an entirely different game now with this variant.","Plus if the risks were equal, as OP has implied, the hospitals would be so massively overwhelmed with vaccine sufferers that there would be no room for covid patients, which obviously isn’t the case.",2
"I experienced the same symptoms and I’m around 6 weeks since my shot. I do recommend the following to ease your pain:1. Pine Needle Tea is a miracle and helps with joint pain 2. Stay away from inflammatory diet/alcohol for couple weeks 3. Two cups of green tea 4. Stay away from heavy workout 6. See if your GP can get you a few physical therapy sessions for your arms","Thanks for that, definitely going to get on that.",2
"But if you're still not sick and still testing negative.. and they're testing positive now.. how can they blame you? Sounds more like someone else in that outing spread it around and you're still not sick despite multiple exposures because your immune system is working very well.","Thats what i tried to say to them as well. Luckily it seems my other friends agreed with me, as well as a lot of these comments, but i cant convince the ones who caught it i guessEdit: I even called my doctors office again today and explained my situation to them. They told me that based on the circumstances, i would not have been the person to infect anyone. But this has all caused a ton of drama amongst my group of friends now all for what appears to be no reason.",2
"Natural immunity is 27% greater than the vaccines for those who had covid. They gain Natural immunity and are told to get a vaccine which does not increase the chances but puts them of risk. Also the people dying are 96% ages over 60","This shit is driving me up the wall. Never before in history have people with natural immunity to a disease that's running around been even recommended vaccination, much less forced it. That's absurd. Stop this nonsense, America.",2
"Take a look at this site. There’s also an exemption form on it. I hear you- I’m at risk of losing my job if I don’t vaccinate. Kinda weird that first the gov was having lottery’s for people to get vaccinated but now they are demanding it.

If the shot really worked I think most would get it and you wouldn’t need to bribe people or mandate it.

It feels like the world is crashing along with the climate change weather chaos.","That's what my family was thinking about, they are giving money and free donuts just because you got the vaccine, it really feels like they are luring you into getting this ""who knows what"" Covid vaccine. One of the guys at my High school told me that there was a donut shop, and they had a rule that every time you walk in and show them your vaccination card, they'll give you a free donut, and you can come back repeatedly to get more donuts until December or something. It feels odd.",2
"Get your platelets checked","Thank you. That sounds like a good idea. My google searching led me to think that since I don't have bleeding under the skin causing blotches I probably would be fine, but I was still concerned and your idea would fully put my mind at ease and enable me to proceed to the second shot worry-free.",2
"First of all make sure it is reported so that adverse effects start being taken seriously. Second get checked, perhaps treated, for a clot in the wrong place. Try different doctors until one takes it seriously.","I did put it on the vac reporting site.",2
"Myocarditis for one. It doesn't stop transmission which means your symptoms may be so low you don't realize you're spreading the virus when you are. No accountability from government or pharma because of the EUA, and the FDA approved Comernity is unavailable in the US.","It’s better to die knowing you have it than to accidentally pass it on.",2
"If you're concerned about your medical risk then you should speak to your doctor about it","This is the only response that matters. You need medical advice to make this decision.",2
"In your survey you say:Myth: after being infected you no longer need the vaccineWhy is that a myth though? Its recommended, sure. But its not necessarily a myth. Latest study says there's no benefit to receive the vaccine if you've been infected.","Bingo.",2
"I know my neighbor who is a sophomore has gotten at least one of the shots and didn’t have any serious reactions minus sore arm and feeling tired. I would also ask your doctor and see what they say too. Good luck","Thanks, I'm planning to go see a doctor and see what they have to say. Good luck to you too.",2
"Prednisone and Diamox helped me. Chat with your doc and consider with doc. Some are advising look at antibody levels to see if you have sufficient levels to warrant the risk of trying another booster. Pro-vax here, but unfortunately we've entered the gray zone for medical advice.","Thanks. That’s a good idea.",2
"My husband also did Moderna on Wednesday after JNJ and had a similar experience. Maybe a little tired too. Glad you’re feeling good- health anxiety is ROUGH in a pandemic!!","Thanks! I was living in NYC in March 2020, so needless to say, the entire pandemic was basically my worst nightmare. Have been doing so much better since I was able to get vaccinated back in March. I’ll probably wear masks in some situations forever (public transit, public bathrooms in particular), even if just for psychological reasons, but it’s all good!",2
"Either you're trolling or you have a serious adult child of alcoholic need for taking responsibility for things that don't have anything to do with you. Apogizing to the planet for being vaccinated is the biggest mindfuck I've heard in a while.","vaccinated people have been pretending we haven' been in a pandemic for the last few months. going on vacations, concert, pubs bars. Large indoor gatherings without masks.It is ok if your quite there when you stop blaming others.&amp;#x200B; ps I said sorry for spreading this, not being vaccinated silly... gees. Why would someone appoligise for being vaccinated?",2
"A doctor currently treating me for covid said that the vaccine is ineffective and dangerous","YES! Not to mention the PCR test has now been recalled... the vaccine is not ok!",2
"Yep but they will tell you no as they do not care about you your expendable.","Yeah , it’s so new that I really can’t trust how it affects people, especially when each situation is unique. That’s why I posted this. It’s also odd that my mom’s coworker and I are experiencing the same symptoms at the same time and received the same vax on the same day. She couldn’t have gotten me sick bc I don’t have any contact w her. My brother who received the Moderna didn’t have these symptoms.",2
"So glad I'm unvaccinated after all I'm seeing. Just saying.","Same",2
"I had sharp pains above and below my heart about once or twice a day for 4-5 weeks after the first dose. I didn't get tested for anything because the condition has since gone away. For the first week after, my heart would race after doing general lifting tasks at work that would have never tired me out before. I seem to be back to normal now, but I've put off getting the second dose because of it.","This was the same for me.  Almost felt like I'd pulled something right next to my heart.  Slowly went away.  Thankfully I did not have the same issue after the booster.",2
"Bodies don't store antibodies indefinitely. It's the Tcells which retain the info to fight future infections.","I’m not sure why the recent antibody findings have everyone all excited. Surely no one expected them to stay elevated? As far as I can tell there is no indication that antibody levels are associated with superior protection from severe illness.",2
"I’m interested in this as well. I just recovered from COVID, and I’d like to give my body a break if it will make me feel like crap again!","Yeah I know the feeling, I don't want to get sick again. If they tweaked the vaccine to target omicron, i'd feel way more inclined to get it. But I think we can count our infection as getting a booster shot if not way better. My state will definitely mandate it soon so I likely wont even have a choice. I was just interested in seeing how others reacted.",2
"I’m so sorry for your loss. Please report this to VAERS. Her doctor deserves to have his medical license revoked (stress - what a joke). I suppose you should follow up with him and ask him if he believes “stress” should be listed as the official cause of death on her certificate. This doctor really needs to be reported. Please continue to share her story with as many people as you can - even if it saves one life. Rest In Peace, sweet angel.","I concur, this doctor was dismissive of her pain at a time when some of the rare but serious adverse reactions should have been well known. But it sounds like OP went ahead and got her a higher level of care, because she had a spinal tap.",2
"Got mine through CVS too! They are absolutely killing it w/ distribution","Agreed! I used Walgreens the first time around and had a good experience, but cvs was definitely more efficient this time around",2
"Man I would never understand people getting this poison despite all the reported issues on this very reddit just crazy.","If anyone knew how dna replication actually works they would think twice. I mean let's say there's a mistake in the code who's gonna fix it? Exactly. Its mutation haven.",2
"I just feel like the whole thing should be private and opt in. As in it’s not opt out and I don’t need to explain myself to opt out. It’s no ones business what medicine I do or don’t take.","Exactly. Asking if someone is covid-vaxxed should be regarded the same as asking someone about the results of their Pap smear. As in, DON’T GO THERE.",2
"She should talk with her doctor. I’ve mentioned this on the sub before, but none of us are qualified to give anybody else medical advice. This is a decision between her and her doctor only.Edit: downvoted for saying someone should talk with their doctor when making a medical decision? Okay then.","Antivaxxers dont like it when people consult their doctors.",2
"Yes! Me too! It's been almost 3 weeks since my booster and I'm just now, within the last day or so, starting to feel better. I had dizzy spells, blurred vision (sporadic), that spacey/disassociated feeling, teeth sensitivity, anxiety, fatigue so bad I thought I would fall asleep while standing some days...it has been a weird wild ride! Sometimes it would feel like my body was buzzing, like my blood was carbonated or something. It was so bad and lasting so long and I was so scared that I called my doctor and asked for blood work to make sure I wasn't having a stroke or was anemic or something. Then my husband asked if it could be the booster. Blood work is all good and normal. I had zero side effects from the first 2 shots but the booster has been awful. I'm still pro-vax but brace yourself for the booster side effects.ETA: feeling like you're high is exactly how I felt. But not in a good way because WTF. Some days it would last all day and other days it was off and on. That's exactly how I described it to my husband. I told him if I didn't know better that I would think someone slipped me something because I felt so damn high some days.","I had the same thing from my first shot, but it’s lasted 5 months. If it gets worse, please don’t be afraid to reach out! I’ve heard many people who develop vaccine long haul after their booster.",2
"Hi friend! I had similar concerns to you - I knew my fear wasn't necessarily rational, but that didn't stop me from worrying about it. I thought about chickening out when I had my appointment, but I really just had to walk in and get it done. This thing I had been putting off for months was over before I knew it. If it makes you feel better, 27/3 million is less than one percent. Looking at the numbers percentage-wise is something that really helped me. In the clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine, Bell's Palsy was only reported by four people. Also, myocarditis isn't always fatal. I understand your anxiety, but I got covid, and it was far scarier than anything I experienced getting the vaccine. I can promise you will feel so accomplished after you do it! I'm here to PM if you want to talk.","This. Thanks for sharing your concerns too, makes me feel a little more relaxed.I’m surrounded by a lot of friends and family who are very much so against vaccine let alone COVID. Getting washed up in all this noise and false information can really trigger you mentally.",2
"Honestly that looks like ringworm. Do you have cats or other animals that bury their poo?","Was gonna second that, looks a lot like ringworm.",2
"That doesn't sound like shaming from just the words, it sounds like a genuine observation. It may be that her tone indicated something more. It also may be that you read more into it due to being uncomfortable on your end. All in all though, no big deal, move on.","You're right, it wasn't a huge deal and I've moved on. It was definitely in her tone. that and the way she looked at me made me feel uncomfortable for waiting so long to get the first shot. Just thought it was interesting enough to share.",2
"That means it's working.","So much this!",2
"I am 65 and have had both doses. Completed a month ago. No adverse effects for either shot. Just posting to say the vaccine can go smoothly. You never hear from people like me. I think there are over a billion of us now.","I think so too.",2
"For info Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor on Twitter has some of the better info. He said this latest report was speculative. All the ER report vaccinated people admitted to the hospital and J and J has done as well as others in protecting people.There is some upside to a J and J booster being added for length of protection and preventing even minor illness. However, nothing to stress about currently.","And it’s one and done.",2
"Because the “vaccine” isn’t a sterilizing vaccine like ones you got as a child. It’s really ridiculous the media is portraying it that way. Once you have one of these you’ll likely be hooked on the boosters for life.","its funny how ppl didn't realize this when the card had four lines on it",2

"Nah I’m gonna stay in the control group","I can't believe the amount of people that are hitching their wagons to Big Pharma to try and get through this. It's mind blowing",2
"It's funny because you aren't allowed to question anything here without being banned","I posted a scientific paper about the dual-use nature of viruses and vaccines. Immediately banned.",2
"There are a lot of sheep that believe everything the MSM and government tells them. They are not free thinkers. They're human pin cushions.","Unfortunately they have a tremendous affect on the way these things are played out. Evil politicians would have little effect without these mindless followers.",2
"I'm going to warn you that correcting these people will not lead to them considering the data and making a new conclusion based off it. As with this sub, anti-vax/covid deniers seek confirmation of their biases. They will question everything that they don't agree with and eat up any story/post/meme that backs up what they believe. I have people in my family like this. I spent a good part of my time earlier this year trying to correct their misconceptions and errors about vaccines and the virus. All it did was make them avoid talking to me about it. They want to be in their little world where they feel superior to everyone because ""they know something you don't"", eating up facebook propaganda, and calling everyone else a sheep. Good luck","How did you cope up with this? It's especially stressful having a mother like this. I'm earning little by little in order to be independent from my parents (in my country, it's common for offsprings to live with their parents till they earn enough money from the first job they had, not like in west). But for now, all I can do is either ignore her, or try to correct her. It's mentally taxing either way.",2
"Flooded with fake side effects in 3...2...1...","Unfortunately true",2
"Edit: I was in fact reading these numbers incorrectly. The correct reduction rates are 66-95%. A more recent study from Imperial College London suggests effectiveness for the delta variant at roughly 61%, assuming age 18-64 and 2 vaccine doses.Unless I’m reading this incorrectly, it seems that being vaccinated reduces your chance of catching Covid by roughly 1%. Its ability to reduce transmission may be in the same neighborhood.","Just one month ago some scientist went on the news and said the shots reduced transmission by *99%* - now it’s the opposite? Good grief.",2
"My bf's mom was 88 and dying of lung cancer and dementia when she got her Pfizer shots. She had no side effects from the vaccine but died 2 months later when the dementia progressed to the point where she couldn't remember how to swallow.My 98 year old grandfather got both his Moderna shots months ago and is doing great. No side effects and no change in his health. Just visited him 2 days ago.","Yes, the dementia killed her. The vaccine had absolutely no role. Thank you for clearly explaining.",2
"So they'll cover the cost on the front end but if I have any issues because of it they won't help on the back end? Sounds like a scam.","Now you're on the right track.Zero downside for them.",2
"My armchair guess is the fully-vaccinated  aren’t being very careful since they feel protected.","I agree- I’m j&amp;j - not yet booster (have antibodies but waiting for next cardio visit as I had a fib after my last visit (3 days after my vax) I noticed when I’m with my 3x vaccinated friends I’m the only one whipping out the sanitizer all the time.  These are all people that have been in my circle last 2 years- they all had sanitizer constantly - now it’s me always reminding people( glad I have cans of it).Also they invite me to the movies or a show or a restaurant with a large amount of people.  They still wearing mask but their behavior is surprising.",2
"Yea get the vaccine. Studies have shown that SOME people, not all, but some people’s long haul Covid symptoms are mitigated by getting the vaccine.

The vaccine has extremely rare side effects. As a young woman, avoid getting the J&J, but otherwise you’ll be fine and potentiallly better after your second shot. The first shot typically triggers a stronger immune responses for people who had covid so you will probably feel sick for a few days, or you may not have any side effects at all.","Totally agree with this.",2
"Don't listen to these vax mutants, you're a pureblood and you should be proud of that.","Yesss !",2
"Personally, I got the vaccine without hesitation but I can understand where people might be hesitant with all of the misinformation being tossed around. You should speak to your doctor. Explain your concerns and let your doctor discuss everything with you. A lot of people will try to send you YouTube videos - I would avoid those because a lot are extremely inaccurate and are made to instill fear amongst the vaccine hesitant","Great advice. The media wants money from clicks no matter the content - health professionals want to save lives - I know who I trust more.",2
"There have been cases reported of blood clots in the abdomen connected to the vaccines, which can present with extreme abdominal pain.  Not sure if this possibility is ruled out by your husband's pain resolving somewhat between doses and then returning, but it can't hurt to be aware.  And btw the ER should never have told you it was impossible for it to be connected to the vaccine, that's medical malpractice.  Look up ""A Case Report of Mesenteric Ischemia After COVID-19 Vaccination"".  ""Thromboses are known adverse events from the COVID-19 vaccines however to our knowledge, there has not been a published case report of embolic mesenteric arterial ischemia after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

Thank you. I'll look into some of that.",2
"This is a classic PR response put out by any standard social media organization, but it is simply not sufficient. We have ample evidence that exposure to extremist ideas on platforms only grows those viewpoints. Mark Zuckerberg had the same opinion before as Reddit does today, thinking that more speech will counter misinformation. He was wrong, and we have years of data to prove this. When you have both antivaxx subs and political subs that ban anyone for disagreeing, you only create echo chambers that strengthen these dangerous viewpoints. Reddit knows this won't go over well, and is cowardly avoiding the issue to keep maximizing numbers and profits, which is why they closed comments for the announcement on this one.Edit: another redditor who posted a similar comment to mine was banned in this sub before my post.","reddit kinda wack sometimes",2
"They say its rare but theres been quite a number of reports popping up about them from what I have seen. Informed consent is important so don't let people pressure you into taking the vaccine if you don't want to.","Exactly!",2
"It's kinda sad how people have to say they are not anti-vaxer when questioning it.","I've said this before, the vaccine topic is becoming so dogmatic for people.

It’s unethical and they’re trying to make you choose between your health or your job. Hope you get this figured out bud.",2

"Thanks for sharing your perspective. No I was not on any medication by the time I got the vaccine, nor did I ever have any problems with my hair. After my experience I can only warn you about the Pfizer vaccine. I was a normal person until I got that vaccine and there was no indication that I would suffer such outcome. If what happened to me over the past couple of weeks were to happen to a teenager that might cause severe mental health problems. So in the interest of your daughter think twice before you vaccinate her with Pfizer. The added problem is that health care professionals take the position that there is no evidence that my condition was caused by the vaccine. They claim this is very common and I likely would have developed it even without the vaccine. However timing is very suspicious. I feel pretty much left alone with the issue.","Trust me, I understand. There is no evidence because, as you said, the doctors, medical professionals who know about your condition do not believe or feel there is a connection between the vaccine and alopecia. However, they should report it as suspicious or at least coinicidental. IF ISSUES ARE NOT REPORTED, OF COURSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE! IMHO, the Western Medicine Industry is broken and is not set up to diagnose or heal but to medicate for profit.

"Because the death rate from covid is less than 1%","If you’re under 60 it’s far less than that",2
"It's not The Mark of the Beast. When The Mark is eventually offered it will be a blatant and conscious decison to reject God/Christ. The pros and cons must be carefully weighed first with the vaccine. It's definitely a decision about health, but don't worry about it from a spiritual sense. I do believe they are pushing for a world governance system where we will eventually be put in a situation where we have to decide to accept a microchip with all of our health info, financial info, social credit history, credit history, climate score, criminal history, etc which will be stored in the chip and implanted into the body. Otherwise, you won't be able to particpate in society. But we're not there yet.","I agree with you about this. I do not believe it’s the mark of the beast - but I do think it’s practice for something like it. My mom also thinks this too.

My sister and some friends believe it’s the end times though and that it is the mark. It just doesn’t line up biblically though.",2
"you do realize that if you are very sick or worst you will not be able to enjoy bars, sports, or even anything else?","I agree. I would wait it out...this green pass won't be around forever, but your side effects may",2
"I had myocarditis a few years ago (unrelated to covid/vaccines) and it was intense.. I knew I had to go get seen. Doctors can test your blood for troponin levels, which will tell them right away if there is damage/inflammation happening in your heart. For something like potential myocarditis, I personally wouldn't wait around for an appointment to get looked at.","Yeah I do kind of worry that I waited too long and it might have gotten worse. But now my appointment is tomorrow so I’m just going to go in for it.How long did it take your myocarditis to be cured? You were on a special medicine?",2
"I’m in the same boat. I’m honestly leaning more to not getting vaccinated. I had covid end of December into January and it honestly wasn’t bad for me. I was never scared of it for myself but worried for others around me. I couldn’t taste or smell for a minute and had a fever one night that broke from normal medicine. My brother had it too. Same thing. We quarantined, got better, and went on with our lives. The vaccine worries me because I don’t know what kind of side effects it would cause me. I know people personally who have had pretty bad side effects from the jab (and others who were perfectly fine) and want nothing to do with that. It’s uncomfortable at work because only unvaccinated individuals have to wear masks and everyone knows who has had the jab and who hasn’t, and I would’ve by now had I not already had the virus","It's really none of anyone else's business who's vaxxed and who's not. The idea that employers are actively discriminating against those that choose not to get an experimental jab is insane.",2
"Congrats, your genes is not susceptible to covid damage. If you survived covid already. IMO, covid survivors would be better off with J&amp;J vaccine.  but that's just me and I'm no scientist just using deductive reasoning.","J and J really had done well in Europe, India, Africa re variants when available. If I had vax fears, I would at least do that. Everyone I know who used J and J did not have lingering side effects. Just my opinion as well.",2
"In my opinion and I am not a doctor , it can affect the nerves.","Well we've certainly seen some evidence of that. Lots of folks reporting tingling, muscle spasms, and on the more severe side we've seen GBS though extremely rare.",2
"It's a personal choice and you have to weigh the risks and benefits. I got it and unfortunately developed a chronic condition called oral lichen planus after. But I know others who got it and are totally fine. And it has clearly saved many people's lives.

I would say it requires some serious thought and consideration though. I do not agree with the people saying it is 100% safe and you should just get it without thinking. Know that it will likely save you from dying from covid. But there is also a small chance of having a reaction. It can be a small temporary thing. Or it can be something chronic like I am now dealing with.","Exactly it is happening an people need to make the choice that best fits them an not be called names for doing what they believe to be right .",2
"For those who have received the Moderna booster…can you confirm that the dose size is in fact a half of the traditional dose (that they use on the 1st + 2nd shots)?","I specifically asked the pharmacist who administered my booster and they confirmed it was 1/2 the original Moderna dose.",2
"I just asked this in another sub. What will the unvaccinated do? Not work? I didn’t get good answers.","If the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated were the only ones that could work the country wouldn't survive.  Look at the unemployment now, if close to 50% of the country was added to that do you think businesses could stay open? The largest percent of vaccinated people are close to or over retirement age.",2
"I’m 4 months out from my second Pfizer shot. I have had multiple negative and long lasting side-effects (eerily similar to “long COVID”). I’ve wanted to cry several times in regret. I feel like I’ve given myself something like an autoimmune disorder. Most annoying is that I start to feel better and think I’m over them only for them to re-emerge a few days later. Literally nearly everyone I know has been vaccinated, and I’m the only one that has had this severe of a response. Wish I’d never done it and will never get a booster.","same",2
"I know 20 + people that all have had little to no side effects","Same",2
"I (21F) got J&amp;J in April and got Moderna booster the other day! I had bad flu like symptoms with J&amp;J and the Moderna side effects were a lot easier. With Moderna I had a fever with body aches and chills that lasted for over a day following the shot but it wasn't as debilitating as the body aches/chills from J&amp;J. Just remember to stay hydrated and take it easy :)","J&amp;J wrecked me.  I'm getting my moderna tomorrow, and I'm WATCHING this thread carefully! Thank you for sharing your experience!",2
"/u/MLG-Monarch any comment?If people are genuinely curious about any issues with the vaccine the last place you’d want comments from is NNN and their ilk.","We have certain measures in place already, however it's almost impossible to enforce this because people create alt accounts and it's extremely difficult to determine genuine from fake and we try not to ban people based on suspicion and only fact as doing the former would silence those with genuine concerns.It's a difficult thing to balance as we want to maintain open and honest discussion but as a consequence, this lets through some with not so good intentions.If you suspect something is off, please report it.",2
"My friend is allergic to paracetamols and had a small amount of redness at the injection site but by the end of the day it was gone.

If it’s a minor allergy I think you’ll be fine. If it’s more severe, check with your doctor and see what they recommend.","thank you so much. i think i’ll consult with my doctor.",2
"What gets me is people on here too, why do people come here AFTER complications to moan and advice etc, the warnings are already here come before you take it","No shit!

I told you so just simply doesn't even cut it.",2
"Injuries from this (not) vaccine are off the charts, check VAERS. Plenty of info available on Natural News & Health Ranger explaining why you should stay far away from this experimental gene therapy treatment...even if it means walking away from your job etc. Do your homework now to save yourself a lot of pain later.","A few dozen cases like this world destroy a company if this were not the narrative propped up by government and media.

Thalidomide killed 10K in the whole world and we are still discussing it.",2
"i think FDA said it was okay to mix and match, so go do it","Thanks! I have no other way of getting a booster anyway, AZ boosters aren't a thing where I live, so I have to get either Pfizer or moderna",2
"Certainly your parents have the best intentions & just want you to be safe. But at the end of the day you are an adult & the decision is yours alone to make. I know it’s a confusing time for many ppl right now. Esp for all you guys under 30. I hope you stay healthy & happy no matter what you decide. Good Luck","Ask your parents how they would feel if you got the vaccine at their behest and something bad happened to you, wouldn't they feel terrible? That is why it needs to be your decision. You don't want your parents feeling guilty over stuff like that.",2
"Only a doctor can tell you. Im not sure how you feel but I would personally er on the side of caution and head to the ED to get a workup.","I would if I could. I don’t really have 2 grand to blow on an ER visit. American healthcare is shit.",2
"Ask your parents how they would feel if you got the vaccine at their behest and something bad happened to you, wouldn't they feel terrible? That is why it needs to be your decision. You don't want your parents feeling guilty over stuff like that.","Good point. Agree totally. If I were in my twenties, getting that shot wouldn’t cross my mind.",2
"These are the vaccine side effects the CDC/FDA is denying.

My health has been compromised since getting the Pfizer dose. Going on 9 weeks. It’s called Multi System Inflammation. Call CDC and file your symptoms.","Yeah so true! Doctors seem to deny the side affects are from the vaccine. The second the words ""covid vaccine"" are uttered, they try to change the topic and label it as another issue.",2
"The amount of people downvoting the news that the vaccine has received FDA approval is really saying something about this sub.","Yes.  Yes it does.",2
"Don't let anyone pressure you into it, but also don't let anyone scare you away either. All you can do is talk to actual medical professionals and discuss your concerns. You seem to know this already, but be weary of the source of any info you get online. I have found info from credentialed medical experts with valid conerns, but I have found a lot more things that sound like the writer is fresh out of Arkham Asylum. I can tell you about my experience. I had AZ a few months ago. Thankfully it was the one I prefered as the mRNA shots are based on very new technolgy. The viral vector technology used in AZ, while still fairly new, has been successfully used in two effective Ebola vaccines, so has more data to back it. I wouldn't have turned down the Pfizer or Moderna, but if they were my only option, I would have waited until about now to get it so I could see how other people in my age group were handling it.As for the jab itself, first shot wasn't great. I felt pretty quesy for a couple of days with a bit of a fever, and my arm was very sore for a week. Second shot was a breeze. Arm was tender for a few hours at most.Anyway, good luck in your decision. I hope it all works out for you.","Thank you so much for sharing your experience. Sadly we don't get AZ in my country at the moment. And yeah, I prefer to not trust random people posting stories on YouTube! I try seek credible people",2
"Vaccination doesn't prevent you from spreading the disease. It just minimizes your chances of getting sick. There's a possiblity of getting sick even if you're vaccinated. None of these methods are 100% effective.","This has been the case from day one.",2
"Scientists can be swayed with prestige, money, power,zzzanything really. I’d follow the peer-reviewed research since you are someone who believes in science (obviously due to your degree) so I would suggest go with what you know.we all know that people can be coerced to say things are not accurate. Research tends to be the most reputable piece of evidence out there. And word of mouth is bullshit.  honestly this entire pandemic has been politicized to no end and I dont trust anybody’s say so because of it. I personally would also take the numbers of unvaccinated people Currently in the hospital dying as a factor since as soon as Johnson and Johnson found eight people who had adverse side effects because of the vaccine they stopped using it for a while!  so if over 12,000,or however many they’re saying, have actually died from the vaccine, what evidence is there to say that they wouldn’t have said anything about it to the public? Also trust your gut because it’s obviously educated","Thanks. This was kind of the vote of confidence I needed!",2
"Follow your intuition. The only person to deal with the consequence if it goes negative is you. So you should only get it if you understand that and are ok with it if it happens. The worst feeling is doing something because of fear or because of someone else telling you to do something and you have a bad reaction. You would live with regrets.","I agree this is the right answer. It seems long haulers and covid vaccine recipients with longer term issues or complications are having some sort of issue with the spike protein that vaccines and organic covid introduce into your body from the virus. You may not know how it will impact you and your worries are legitimate but at the end of the day you need to decide on what is best for you and those around you.",2
"I think the low fever should kick in by either day 1-3. If it's been a week it could be something else. Others here will comment but I don't think I have seen anyone have a fever that far out after any dose.","I totally agree! It seems odd to me too for the side effects to kick in so far out after the vaccine. Maybe it triggered something else?",2
