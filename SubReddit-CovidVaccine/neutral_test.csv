"I got JJ late July (19m, healthy), had horrible fever (103f), chills, and bodyaches that night. Went away as I got more sleep. Day 2-3 I had weird chest pain that made it hard to focus. Ended up getting an EKG and troponine test on my doctors recommendations. Everything came back normal and after like a week I was back to 100% and have had nothing ever since.","Thanks brother! Glad to hear you're in the clear",1
"Forgive me if i’m mistaken, but viruses don’t tend to become more deadly as they mutate? Sure, they might be more easily transmitted since the virus adapts and finds different ways to enter your system, but never more deadly, it’s just not how viruses work. Seems a bit misleading to me.","Mutations are random. They could go either way. There is some evolutionary pressure towards lower lethality, because if the virus kills all hosts, it won’t spread. However, we have pretty much maxed out COVID mitigation. Compliance is decreasing every day. Say that a variant emerged with a 35% death rate and a 14 day incubation time (these numbers are not unheard of when it comes to other coronaviruses), what are we going to do? How many people will comply with strict mask mandates and hard lockdowns again? It’s unlikely that such a variant would emerge, but it’s not inconceivable.",1
"I currently have a pretty swollen armpit I dont really feel a node the whole armpit feels swollen. Starting to panic a bit but this kinda made me feel better. How long did the swelling last for you if you don't mind me asking?","Only 3 days with the booster. Had one in my neck with second shot for about 2-3 weeks. They can go anywhere from a couple days to near a month I think",1
"fuck reddit and its censorship of thought. fuck reddit the propaganda mill. fuck reddit the totalitarian narcissistic cowardly shadow banning trash magazine. fuck reddit jannies and fuck their stakeholders. I will get a sim card for 5 dollars and post whatever i want again. and when i get shadowbanned, I will do it again. You can never stop us. Your bots and algorithms are no match for a human mind oppressed. Fuck reddit to hell.","Can't get outside of the country without it.",1
"There’s a lot of debate on how effective Pfizer is on delta now … I would wait to get a dose of Pfizer. Wait until the UK announces what their booster plans will be. The UK is doing mix and match studies … wait and see if they recommend a Pfizer after 2 AZs","I can probably wait it out but I don't really like getting infected. Is there absolutely no data about revaccination?",1
"I would ask for some sort of exemption and if not try and find someone who will get you the paperwork to say you got it. I just read that some clinics in some places are selling them to people who don’t want the vaccine and need it to participate in society.  If this happened with the first shot, do not take the second. It could be way dangerous. Your body is telling you no. We are not all made the same and some have dropped dead within hours while others go about their way. Please do not take the second shot. It could do serious damage.","I am in europe we cant pay for this paper. Now i am just anxious with a health problem. What happened if i catch covid now. Before vaccine i wasnt afraid because i was a healthy athlete .",1
"Sudafed is not an antihistamine, it's a decongestant. It's essentially a stimulant.","Yes, did not realize this. Maybe I'll give another antihistamine a try.",1
"I’d opt for Pfizer or Moderna. Maybe you’d fair better with MRNA instead of the traditional vaccine J&amp;J offers. That’s scary. I had Pfizer and really didn’t feel any side effects.","Are you around my age too??",1
"Me and my wife, both about 60, got it 10 days ago on a Friday afternoon. About 12 hours later we both woke up with chills; thankfully that only lasted about an hour or so. The next day, we were both severely fatigued, but nothing else...we spent the day just laying around all day. The next day (Sunday), we were pretty much back to normal. We both went to work on Monday (a week ago). Since then, nothing!Knocking on wood now, because I have read accounts of people getting some side effects weeks, or even months later.","Thank you! If it eases your mind my cousin (32) got it about 4 months ago and he's still ok, just be safe!",1
"Well according to a CDC report, 78% of those being hospitalized with covid are overweight or obese. Something to factor into your decision.","Yeah, but it's pretty low for someone in their 30s with only one comorbidity. Still, I go out of my way to prevent catching it, to extreme levels. The only reason I'm looking at getting vaccinated is I'm kind of over it and want to return to some level of normalcy. I've developed really bad problems with anxiety and depression over these past two years. Something has to change, but I'm also worried about vaccine injury, and even if there are no side-effects, I'm concerned with how efficacious the vaccines actually are.

My appointment is in a couple hours. I'm still not sure if I'm going to go.",1
"This happened to me, cream of wheat craving, during pregnancy. It's incredibly high in iron. Listen to your body.","It is?? Didn’t know that neat!",1
"What if you got vaccinated and then get a mild case or have no symptoms at all?","All the data suggests that vaccine plus natural immunity offers the greatest possible immunity. If you get the vaccine yet still get a mild breakthrough case, you're probably in pretty good shape going forward. Consider it your booster.",1
"I had covid and am vaccinated. My symptoms would have been bad, but I started taking a fever reducer the instant I felt shitty, so my fever broke at 101. I also broke out in hives, which has NEVER happened to me for any reason ever. 2 weeks after the shot and I have the metallic smell/taste sensation that I had with covid.

Very odd symptoms.","I also had Covid and got moderna about a month afterward. Funnily enough, I also had the metal taste for a few weeks after the vaccine. I read that most people who got the metal taste were in the Midwest. Wondering if it was a batch thing.",1
"This happened to my mother- she had had a previous injury in the opposite arm. I am assuming inflammation in the old injury?","I haven't had any injuries in that arm that I'm aware of, aside from a period where 3 of my fingers went numb following some weight lifting.",1
"Move your arm around lots, it’ll help with the pain! Congratulations!!","I wasn't able to move mine at all... my brain would stop me because of that punctual pain but the good news is it just completely disappeared within 2 days!So even if you can't move your arm which is basically a good thing to do, stay cool it will go back to normal pretty fast",1
"Yes. I was healthy before, now I am disabledAnd I am usually pro-vaxx","What are your symptoms?",1
"I'm sorry you've gone through this. I hope things improve for you.","Thank you.  I hope so, too.  I am doing much better now — I can at least function now and take care of my family, albeit with pain, fatigue, and weakness.   I was bedridden for about two months and had to take medical leave from work.  I was in a really bad place then and wasn’t getting much help from doctors.",1
"I'd try some boric acid suppositories they treat yeast/BV and rebalance the pH. Doubtful its related to the vaccine. Since you don't actually have a vagina you probably don't know that tons of things can throw off vaginal pH, like just showering, or sex. Maybe worry about yourself instead of her vagina.","We're leaning toward BV. It's definitely not yeast. Thanks for your input.",1
"Lots to read here. Does it basically break down to ‘Not Approved’ like this guy says?","Worth reading all of it.* Only BioNtech Comirnaty is licensed. Pfizer vials out there are still EUA and under liability protection.* FDA admits there is increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis and VAERS is insufficient to assess risk.* They list more then a dozen clinical trials that need to be done to evaluate safety.* Haven’t assessed long-term risks, like cancer.* Admit they are gene therapy products and should have their safety evaluated consistent with a gene therapy product.",1
"Definitely see an ENT. Might be some steroids they can try. I think it would be great if Pfizer could start to recognize this as a real issue/side effect and determine the cause and best method of treatment. I am pro-vaccine and received my first shot on April 29. I mostly hear the ringing only at night now, and it’s not debilitating. But, I’m afraid that the second dose will make it worse... so I have not received my second dose yet. But, I have read some positive cases here of the ringing going away.","Did you end up getting the second dose?",1
"It is hard to find solid data on this but here is a preliminary study.  Bear in mind that this sub is heavily inundated with anti vaxxers.  Verify EVERYTHING you read here with a doctor.","Not an anti-vaxxer in any way but FWIW, even a doctor I know has been directing long-haulers to communicate with some of the other long-hauler affinity/support groups online. IIRC, one of these groups even published an academic paper on long Covid. ""Doctors"" is a pretty general term btw and IME most people who went to medical school feel confident expressing their opinion on all sorts of things far outside their specialization. There was, for instance, a time when most all pediatricians would tell you vegetarianism (god forbid veganism) was potentially ""dangerous"" despite the fact that nutrition is historically taught for less than a day in US med schools. A rather ironic dis to the Hippocratic oath's namesake who is believed to have said ""Let food be thy medicine"" btw....Point being yes for sure, confirm things and the right doctor is a perfect authority to do so. But in the case of longhaul COVID which the medical establishment is only still learning about, do make sure its one you feel has a comfortable amount of humility about what they don't know and says as much, making clear the difference, to you between when they're stating and when they're speculating.",1
"I found that Ibuprofen and Tylenol made a big difference.","How much tylenol did you take?",1
"The chills and sweats will go away, then the weirdness sets in if you are one of the lucky ones. If you are SUPER LUCKY you will be symptom free! I hope you are one of those. Because I am not, and it sucks!","The weirdness?",1
"I think the first and second. An auto immune reaction to the spike protein. It’s seen in people who had COVID too, especially long haulers. Don’t think it’s mRNA specific, as I had it in my legs for weeks after J&amp;J","I had it in my legs too for a couple weeks after Pfizer, fully gone now I’m a little over a month and a half out and they are fully gone",1
"Did you have regular blood work done before this vaccine at some point? Were you anemic or low on b12? Not that that you should be required to do that before a vaccine, but a lot of people keep saying they're 'healthy' that have had sever reactions, but i wonder whether these people (perhaps you as well) had an underlining condition exaggerating this reaction.","Yes, I've had bloodwork done several times in the last 2 years and everything was normal.",1
"I had 0 side effects from J&amp;J.  Literally 0.40M at the time.","If you don't mind me asking you know how long ago you got it? And appreciate the input.",1
"I got Moderna but same concept. Got it on a Friday at 230pm. Felt fine all night until midnight when I went to bed. Woke up at 3am and felt “weird”. Not sick, just off. Woke up at 5am and felt horrible. Low grade fever and lots of muscle aches and headache. Stayed in bed all day. By Sunday morning, I was fine…like it never even happened.  My 14 year old nephew got Pfizer and had no reaction to either shot. Everyone in my house had the same reaction to Moderna. My parents had no problems with Moderna. My brother got J&amp;J and felt bad the next day. Much like Covid-19, people have varying responses to the vaccine. You are experiencing what my family experienced. Hope it goes away soon. But know your symptoms are normal. We were all better in about a day or so.","This is very reassuring to read as i am experiencing all of that in a (hopefully) similar timeline. Thank you.",1
"As others have said LVH takes years to develop and is a consequence of things like hypertension, heart valve issues, etc.. So with 100% certainty you didn’t develop LVH from the vaccine.   Also a solitary ekg at an urgent care is absolutely not confirmatory for LVH.  The cardiologist will be the one to determine that.  Now is the immune response to the vaccine causing you symptoms? Quite possible, but these symptoms should be short lived.","Thanks. Didn’t mean to be alarmist. My theory is the LVH was present before the vaccine, but the immune response made the symptoms pronounced and noticeable when they were not previously. Are there any similar case studies with immune responses triggering underlying heart issues associated with the vaccine?",1
"I think we tend to notice reactions similar to ours. I had an adverse reaction after the first and I sought out posts from people with a similar experience.  IRL, I know a lot of people that had a stronger response for the second dose and boostered individuals who had no reaction to the third. The booster should have the same composition as the first two doses if you stuck with the same manufacturer. It’s the same shot. Only exception is the moderna booster is a half dose of the regular shot.","What was your reaction to the first?",1
"How are you doing?","I ended up getting it yesterday at 2:30 instead of last Friday, and right now my only side effects are a sore arm and some fatigue! I did experience my heart racing last night for around 15-20 minutes, but it subsided and I haven’t had it again.",1
"If you already had Covid, there’s no need for the vaccine. You have natural immunity. Your body has already developed the anti bodies to fight it off.","Hi, you do have natural immunity after covid, but only for about 90 days.",1
"I got Pfizer for all 3 shots. The first shot? Wild side effects but they peaked at 8 hours after the shot and went away less than 8 hours later. The second shot? Mild fatigue and arm pain. The third shot??? Absolute violence in my body. It's been 4 days and I'm still having painful side effects. Every single one on a list and a swollen armpit! lol","I'm scheduled to get my booster on January 3rd. I was in hell after getting the 2nd shot. I felt like I was going to die. I'm dreading my booster shot. But I have to get it no matter how badly I don't want to go through such an agonizing experience.",1
"He probably has covid and is common after getting the vaccine unfortunately.","Not sure this is true and it’d assume the rapid test was a false negative.",1
"Do they list contraindications such as bleeding or blood disorders on the consent form? That may get you out of it …and you can show that to your school","As far as I know they say there's no risk for family history with bleeding disorders but I am still concerned it will trigger something",1
"I've seen some theoretical modeling, but they won't have real-world data for a few more months, since we're the first study group for it.","I don’t really need anything very specific, if you have some idea of the general trend seen with the models or estimation I would be fine with that.",1
"It could be from the vaccine or could be from starting college. When I started college my period came 2 weeks early when it was always right on schedule normally. It’s stress-related. If it is from the vaccine (which it very well could be) then likely your period will normalize over the next few months. Just b/c it came early this month doesn’t mean it will be like that every month.","I actually don’t start college till the 20th, I’m still currently in my hometown and everything I’m a junior and have definitely been way more stressed out before and still got my period on time. I don’t think its stress related, but maybe it could be that my body’s stressed out or something from being worked out from those side effects? I got no clue though lol. I had covid in march and my period was still normal too",1
"I always think about people who have terrible reactions to the vaccines, are they more likely to suffer from Covid worse?  Like a spike protein set off a major response in their body, if they had been exposed to Covid their body would have a similar response to the spike protein but at the same time have to fight off the virus.  Or maybe it’s the opposite I dunno.Always wondered about that, sounds like you had a shit vaccine experience.  I can understand your hesitancy.","My husband and I both had horrible, long lasting side effects from the vaccine. There’s no way in hell either of us are getting more shots. We had mild covid in February 2020. For us the vaccine reactions were much worse than covid. I doubt the side effects have anything to do with how one would have handled covid.",1
"My second dose was bad. I had nausea for the first two days. Then chills, extreme fatigue and ongoing migraine for 10 days. Take it easy and rest it will go away eventually.","Ok thank you! You feel good now??",1
"Did you get the second dose?","No I did not get the second dose - I have only just mostly recovered 5 months later and still on meds.",1
"Lots of people have been identifying auto immune symptoms and some with flare ups of thyroid disfunctions, that may have been dormant for years. If your mum is able she should try to get bloodwork done for a full thyroid panel. If it can be identified as this then she may get relief via medication. Just my personal opinion as someone who has thyroid disorder and is watching these developments. Wishing you well","Thankyou !",1
"Some supplement suggestions:ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid) for the Neuro pain, helps with my racing heart too.NAC for inflammation.I would encourage you to research both. I take them daily for long-term chronic pain and neurological issues. CBD/CBG for inflammation and anxiety symptoms, derived from hemp no THC needed.Vitamin D is good for just about everyone, we're all pretty deficient and it helps alleviate a lot of various symptoms.r/dysautonomia and r/pots might have a lot more for you to look into.Best luck friend.ETA: one more I thought of that I'm taking again is serrapeptase. This one is definitely interesting to read up on, I take it to help clean up any junk proteins and internal scar tissue, mainly to help clean out my lungs from phlegm but it also works a lot like NSAIDs","Thank you! I will look into them",1
"Get your heart checked.","And your undergarments!",1
"I seem to have these symptoms after my Moderna booster (Tuesday). I’m also still sensitive to light since Tuesday. Everything seems loud. It’s like a sinus headache, low blood sugar headache, and migraine all together in one. Super fun!","Hey did your light sensitivity resolve? I’m a month out from first Pfizer and have terrible light sensitivity",1
"I had tinnitus before the vaccine but not as loud, today and yesterday (1 mont after the vaccine) I see a bit of improvement. Maybe this is because I started taking xanax but Im not sure, I hope it goes to pre vaccine levels.","How has it been? I’m desperate for some good news.",1
"Thank you so much for sharing this!! I actually had the first vaccine flare up some health stuff so I have been waiting to get the second, however I’m scared I may have been exposed to covid and this is such a relief to see.","If I can remember to, I'll try to update after I've had my second dose and see if I notice anything helps me cope with the symptoms I'll let you know! I've been prepping with lots of water, zinc, and increasing my vitamin D a little.",1
"Fevers, chills and muscle pain are listed as the most common side effects. You mention high fevers, but also 100 degrees. Anything under 100.4 is usually not considered a fever, and *high* fever usually starts from 102.2.From the information in this post, it does sound like typical reactions.","My sister and I both had over 102 and peaked at 103 degrees.",1
"When you go to the doctor, ask for a D-dimer blood test.","Thank you!",1
"Three months of this for me, seems to be normal for many","Yeah I’ve heard a lot of reports. Thankfully mines gone away! Hope yours clears up with some time.",1
"Sweden, Denmark, and Finland have banned Modena due to myocarditis risks especially in young men.  Chances are he is experiencing this.  Hives are also a risk.  Glad he is being seen by doctors.  these vaccines affect everyone differently.  Just because some people don’t have reactions doesn’t make it safe for everyone.  Some people have peanut allergies.  Some people have latex allergies.","Can you have myocarditis without chest pain and other prominent symptoms?",1
"been there with long covid. done mri, nerves test and all other exams: sll negative. It will go away, just a matter of time.","reading things like this really eases my anxiety, thanks for sharing! if you don’t mind me asking, how long did it take for yours to go away? mine definitely has subsided but i’m still feeling a tiny bit “off”, i also went off birth control so my body is adapting to that, but i’m not 100% yet",1
"What is in the ""booster"" that is is different from the ""vaccine""","They're the same",1
"Can we please get an update? How are you feeling??","back to perfect health. i’d say like a week and a half maybe two weeks after posting this i started to feel like a normal person again.",1
"Does anyone know if people with bee allergy can get the vaccine? That requires a epipen. Online CDC it says it’s fine but looking through Reddit people are saying otherwise.","I’m allergic to bees and have an epipen for them. Called my doctor and he said it was fine. Got Pfizer and was completely fine after",1
"Im 24 I've also had my 2 Pfizer shots which i still have side effects from, No previous health issues before being vaccinated. So I personally won't be taken any booster especially with how mild the omicron variant appears to be","As expected having a negative experience with a vaccine means you get downvoted for sharing your experience",1
"First shot, my arm was sore for a week. Second, i was only sore for a day. Take some Advil, unless you have a fever then go with Tylenol.","Thanks. Is it safe to take painkillers?",1
"Have you ever had a pcr test that was negative, or have you only ever tested positive?","After my symptoms subsided the two times I had covid I went and got tested and they were negative",1
"Do the research before injecting anything. Apparently they -CDC are starting to study the effects the vaccine has on women. Might be a sign?","Of course they only thought of women now, after almost a whole year of administering the vaccines to millions of women.",1
"Update: I called my local hospital and talk to a medical professional and she stated that what is experiencing is due to anxiety but if I feel chest pain I should go in","This sounds exactly like an anxiety attack. These are all the same symptoms (including the diarrhea) I have when I have an anxiety attack.",1
"I got Moderna three months ago. First month, it caused a second period to come two weeks after ending. Second, nadda. Third I got it, but it's been twelve days and it's not stopping. Been heavy the whole time.I was completely normal before the vaccine. I went to my primary and gyno. Both told me it was a big hit to the immune system and that the pituitary gland will re regulate itself in 3-6 months, and to come back to them if there's problems. Only time or birth control will fix this. I'm really annoyed.","This is a frustrating response that I am hearing from several women who have had their menstrual cycle disrupted. Doctors only can hypothesize about why it happens, but they honestly don't know what causes the disruption or when it will go back to normal. Our health &amp; regulatory agencies (CDC &amp; FDA) are clearly not doing enough to research these effects and present a clear cost/benefit analysis of these shots for healthy women who may want to conceive. They say it will hopefully go back to normal within 3-6 months...ok, so if we are told to take yearly booster shots, then will there potentially be a yearly 3-6 month disruption in a woman's cycle? We just don't know, we don't have the long-term data.",1
"My brother had the same experience after Pfizer vaccine (first dose). Actually, I thought this was him posting at first. He had a similar issue a few years prior so I am just wondering if the inflammation from the vaccine caused it to flare up. For the record I’m a critical care RN and pro-vax (have received my Moderna booster as of last week). Thank you for sharing this though, I sent the link to this thread to him this morning. He is following up with a urologist.","Thanks for the response. I have not experienced any discomfort or pain in that region before getting that second dose. It is possible that there could have been inflammation that wasn't bad enough to cause pain I suppose.",1
"Yeah, same here too. I have so much anxiety about this situation. I’m terrified about possible side effects from the vaccine but also terrified about the possible side effects if I were to get COVID. After months and months of hesitation, I have decided to get the J&J next Friday.","J&J is the least effective. Studies have shown Moderna protects all variants in addition, Moderna gives your body more antibodies.",1
"Suspected MIS-A from my first dose, followed by POTS and MCAS diagnosis.  Severe, grade 4 reaction (per CDC — added to a study).   Still not fully recovered almost 10 months later.","I’m so sorry! I saw earlier that you wanted the Novavax vaccine for your second - did Drs say that would be a good option for you once it comes out?",1
"My work asked for vaccine cards recently in preparation for the government’s new vaccine/testing mandate which is supposed to go into effect in January. This mandate affects every employer with at least 100 employees. They need to see the cards so that they know who has been vaccinated and who will need to get weekly tests instead. Maybe that’s what your manager is doing, too? There have been some court cases challenging the mandate, but my work is collecting the info to be prepared in case it happens. I don’t think most places are sending home asymptomatic people who have been exposed anymore. The best you can do is test and watch for symptoms.","Well they haven’t said the reason they’re asking for the cards, which is why i thought it was weird.",1
"Are there visible canker sores (apthous ulcers)?","Nope. Which I’ve had before during the flu (always fun). The inside of my mouth looks totally…normal? As normal as mouths go.",1
"I was thinking about getting the shot but ended up getting Covid in late April. I had a fever for a week, fatigue, loss of smell for 3 days, shortness of breath for a few days, bad cough. I was going to get the shot but was told to wait 90 days. By then the reports were coming out that the vaccine wasn't really working like they had hoped, mask back up, and now booster.

My natural anti bodies are better than anything that is made in a lab.","You’re fortunate. I’ve taken care of patients who had Covid once, they had mild symptoms, the second time was a different story.",1
"I have the exact same symptom 2 weeks after Pfizer. Deep dull pain in left testicle and purple coloring on the scrotum. Was hoping it would go away after a few days but still here after 2 weeks. Have never experienced this before in my life.","I’m sorry to hear this man. That sounds exactly what has happened to me. It sucks big time. I have discovered wearing loose pants helps the pain. Have you had it looked at by a doctor?",1
"it is dangerous to self prescribe any medication in a manner that has never been tested, do not get the 4th dose","Fourth jabs for immunocompromised individuals is being recommended now.",1
"If you didn’t have a strong response to the first dose and especially after waiting so long, I doubt you will have any trouble with your second dose.","I only had a badly sore arm and maybe slight chills if I can remember and I think that's it",1
"Who are you concerned will get sick exactly?","Good question. I should edit to include. I have a history of pregnancy loss, two clotting disorders (currently managed but it still worries me), and my living child was a preemie (tried to come 33 weeks 6 days but held off until turning 34w). I’m worried to be a breakthrough case and have it cause premature birth or a super shitty feeling last few weeks. Or be Covid positive at birth. Also my toddler. He has an airway issue that hasn’t really been a problem for over a year but adding any sickness is of course non-desired.",1
"3 friends of mine who are fully vaccinated have been diagnosed with cancer. All three of them are under 35. My sister says two of her friends who are even younger have been diagnosed. All fully vaccinated. This will go down in history as one of the most evil attacks against humanity.","What type of cancer?",1
"I was pretty much back to 80% recovered from 5 months of longhaul covid apart from a few food intolerances, pre-vaccine, but both the first and second dose of Pfizer made me relapse pretty bad, a week and a half after each dose, gave me all my initial covid symptoms back (diarrhea, POTS and feeling like I was passing out/dying). Back to a strict low histamine diet and taking extra iron and gingko and seems to be doing better but wondering if anyone else had this happen to them and if they got better afterwards.","Exact same situation if you read my post history. Unfortunately I'm just getting worse.",1
"How are you feeling today?","I still get weird intense pain in my arm for a few seconds, and I'm pretty sure it caused me sexual dysfunction with premature ejaculation, never heard of that side effect but it only started happening after my 1st dose, doctors can't explain what's wrong and I get very light headed and almost faint when reaching an orgasm. I'm afraid of people laughing about it but im more concerned about my health tbh.- Apart from that, I'm doing better after a month! Not more chills, severe pain or excessive insomnia.",1
"Did she tell you the std tests came back negative or did she show you the results?","Uhh yeah she showed me the bloodwork 2nd time again because the doctor think they didnt get enough sample the first time and its still normal. I took her to the doctor appointment too lol. facepalm/",1
"4 months out from first vaccine and nervous to get the second so late. Thanks for posting.","Canada and UK did this. They did it because of limited vaccines but ironically recent research suggests possible higher efficacy with more dispersion between doses. The only counter point to this is the desire to rush to vaccinate everyone. But, since no one is really getting vaccinated, it's no big deal to wait in my mind. But based on existing research I think you'll be fine getting it now.",1
"I’ll start: my sister has been experiencing severe unexplainable abdominal pain ever since getting the the second dose of Pfizer. She also has overall weakness and is now easily susceptible to the common cold. Doctors have done a few tests and haven’t found anything. This has been going on for over 6 months.","Sorry to hear, I had horrendous abdominal pain, like cramps in my intestines for like 2 weeks, followed up with diarrhea. Luckily I went away. Hopefully your sister feels well soon.",1
"I presented to ER with heart issues on day 10 after Pfizer 2. Doctor said I would “likely” be able to “relax about side effects” after 48 days. Day 15 today, still as bad, seeing a cardiologist tomorrow. If my heart doesn’t get me, another month of hyper vigilance will, ngl.","I understand, my main issue is the uncertainty. I have ADHD and that causes me to overthink everything, and watching for ""anything weird"" was triggering my anxiety to no end. Happy to report that other than the pain at injection site for about 48 hours after, neither me, nor my brother, nor the friend who went with us, nor my mom who is allergic to pretty much everything have experienced any side effects in the last 30-ish days. My mom already got the two doses (about 3 months ago) and is perfectly fine. Due to a shortage in vaccines in my country my next dose (also my brother and my friend's) will be in October, but the government recently announced that depending on vaccine availability they may be calling up people for the second dose sooner, which is positive, I think. Hope everything is fine with your heart, hopefully something that can be taken care of easily, and thank you so much for sharing your experience.",1
"I’m 23M and got my second Pfizer shot yesterday as well actually. About the same side effects but different. I didn’t get any sleep last night from the side effects, felt them like 10 hours later. Full body aches, headache, appetite loss (no nausea) chills and if I lift my arm that got the shot, easy 10/10 pain. That dream like state is super accurate, it’s like a low rate LSD trip without the visuals or fun. The tinnitus is real though, it sometimes varies in volume lmao. I felt similar in my first shot and all the side effects went away the third day while I was awake. Weirdest feeling ever.","That sucks about the tinnitus. I didn’t get that as a side effect but I hope it’s not permanent for you.",1
"How’s your node doing?","Dang! Well I got my booster today. Nodr still exists pushing 9 months now",1
"The vaccine is only 99.99% safe. Why take a risk? Your chances are much safer contracting the Covid 19 bio weapon from the Wuhan lab then a US made vaccine.","You had me in the first stretch, not gonna lie",1
"I honestly thought it was just me.  I had my second Moderna shot end of April and both my arms still feel like I've been hit with a baseball bat. My right arm is so bad I can't lift anything over 5lbs and can not raise my right arm over my head. Both my arms have a clicking sensation when I'm trying to lift anything and both my arms feel like my biceps are bulging out of my arm.","Did you have the shots in both arms or just one? I had both jabs in my left arm (the ar+B674:C675m I've been having problems with ever since).",1
"Yup, your cells start creating spike proteins, and presenting them on their surface to get ""noticed"" by your immune system, within minutes of vaccination.It takes a rhibosome about 4 minutes to construct a spike protein, IIRC.","Oh wow ok that’s great! Here I was stressing about how I might’ve dampened my immune response to the vaccine by taking Tylenol 6 hours after the shot for no reason (I’ve read some people had a hard night with side effects so I though why not take it just in case). But ok, if the vaccine starts to do its work immediately, I guess I didn’t screw up big time",1
"Second dose Pfizer. Diagnosed partial Dysautonomia POTS. On month 8. Head in over to r/longhaulervaccine. It’s quarantined but kits if information on what you’re asking about.","I tried to look at that sub but it says I need to contact the moderators to be able to see it? Is that right?",1
"Myocarditis is a known side effect and is much more prevalent than the public realizes due to the politicization of the product. I have a family member, 26 yo dealing with the same thing. I hope it gets better, may try to find a doctor who will be honest and work on healing for you. The heart muscle damage can become permanent so it would be good to get ahead of it.","You can have a mild case of myocarditis meaning very little inflammation and very few symptoms with no cardiomyopathy but then suddenly die of an arrhythmia because a small amount of inflammation is required to cause a life-threatening arrhythmia.",1
"I let my dr know that I had history of allergic reactions and that sometimes hives/reactions were brought on without any known trigger, they watched me for 30 minutes. schedule her shot so that you can monitor her for the day/night.talk w her doctor, allergist, etc. get multiple opinions.","Thank you for your response, I have talk to both dr and allergist they say to take monoclaste and ceterizine 2 days prior and 7 days post. Did you take these?",1
"I work in a dental office and we have one patient who had a similar reaction. The only difference is, it hasn’t even crossed their minds it’s from the vaccine. Her Drs are saying it’s an autoimmune disease...it’s frustrating to see what to me is “obvious” when others don’t. I’m sorry to hear you are going through this. Hopefully nothing serious comes of it.","For all I know it could be Herpes Simplex, as I used to get it rarely after some intense fevers, but it only occured in my lips not gums, this is why I'm worried.Can't see my dentist due to holidays atm, will make sure to update you guys once I sort it out.Thanks for your kind wishes &lt;3",1
"Your name is lymeguy. Did the vaccine have any effect on your Lyme, assuming you have lyme?","I was concerned about that but it didn't end up being bad for me. Had mostly one bad night of side effects and that was about it.",1
"May I ask what you mean by twitching? Is it muscular or more internal? I’m not a doctor by any means, just asking because I’ve experienced two things I could define as twitching in my chest/sternum. One is like a simple very quick muscle contraction, and the other I believe is called extrasistole and it’s when your heart skips a beat and the next one feels much stronger. I don’t know what causes the muscle issue (but afaik it isn’t dangerous!) and most extrasistole aren’t dangerous either, but they can get worse with stress. Can you see a cardiologist just to put your mind to rest about your heart’s health? That might be a good idea :)","It’s just like a twitching, nothing intense or painful, I’ve had heart palpitations and this feels nothing like them, it’s just a light twitch, maybe I notice it more at night because I’m not busy!",1
"Yes i got up to 80's at rest as well (normally 55-60).Only a few days. Didn""t notice with second shot.","I took a paracetamol or three in total. 80's is nothing to worry about, especially if your immune system is working for you.",1
"Oh wow you got booster, what country are you in. I want a booster but don’t qualify in the states since I’m 28.","Are you in the US? The Pfizer and Moderna eligibility now includes even just overweight people (not just obese people) which is the majority of people. The J&amp;J eligibility is everyone over 18. and 2+ months after their shot.",1
"I’m by no means an expert, but based on other posts here it sounds like myocarditis.  Here is a story on it. I saw one poster saying not to get the second dose because it’ll only amplify the symptoms you’re having. I really hope it gets better","It's frustrating that I wasn't told anything about this prior to getting the vaccine. Thanks for sharing.",1
"Yes its inflammation of your stomach caused by the vaccine. I ended up with pretty bad gastritis and had to have an endoscopy. Mine luckily went away after about 5 months but I had to give up dairy. Gaviscon  the uk version not the us version works great too. You can get it on Amazon. Pricey and tastes disgusting but worth it. Hope you feel better.","I’m going to monitor mine, i’m coming up just about 4 weeks.Do you know why stomach would be inflamed from the vaccine? haven’t got the second shot yet. don’t want these symptoms to linger around after each shot",1
"I will try and find it for you! It was a news report","thank you.

low platelet count is already a known side effect from the vaccine so i don't think people can say vaccine doesn't have anything to do with blood cancers.",1
"I can’t tell you what to do, but all of my family and friends have been vaccinated without severe side effects. I have one friend who had covid prior to the vaccine and she did have an immune response (felt flu-like + fever for 24hrs) after the vaccine. I can’t say for sure, but you would likely have a similar response. That said, she has knowingly been exposed to covid many times since then (healthcare worker) and has not had a test come back positive.","She had a response to the 1st vaccine, but not the 2nd. Your response will also depend on how long ago you had covid. She got the vaccine ~2 months post covid and that’s why her response was stronger than average.",1
"Question if your comfortable answering how old is your husband? Age groups so play a factor into symptoms displayed but i do wish your husband the best","Thank you… he’s 36",1
"First dose Pfizer in June. POTS-like symptoms. Hope it goes away again.","Wishing you better!",1
"Increased heart is a result of almost any infection or anything causing a fever. Mine spiked too. The vaccine makes your body think under attack by an infection - hence the side effect. Go see a doctor if you’re concerned or it’s not going away.","Thank you! Do you remember how long yours stuck around?",1
"He might not feel like playing the day after. My husband got his second shot on Friday &amp; it knocked him down pretty bad (fever, tired, muscle aches) the next day. Is there an option to push his 2nd shot a few extra days?","We were able to delay it to the day after practice, so 2 days after his original.",1
"The important thing is not to panic and that your mind beats you with bad thoughts.Relax, do meditation sessions morning, afternoon and evening to relax.Sunbathe for Vit D and I have read many health professionals recommending supplements, intermittent fasting.All of this will help you a lot if you are not vaccinated.All I say are humble advice that I have read from many professionals and proven that they work, they are not dangerous at all.","Well im hoping what i got now on me is not covid and i recover fast. Altho i do feel like dying honestly. Even tho rapid test came back negative(which i also dont trust to be accurate). Maybe in a few weeks after i recover from w.e i have now me and my SO can go together and try to get the first shot. Better then nothing huh",1
"My niece got pancreatitis so bad three days after her second shot that she’s still on a special diet. My heart felt so weird and bad one week after my first shot that I did not get the second.I don’t know what I’m going to do if they require it for things. I will not risk taking it again until more research is in","What was the heart reaction? Rapid beating or pounding at night?",1

"I GOT MY BOOSTER SHOT OCT 23, 2021. EVERY SINCE THEM I CAN HARDLY WALK, BECAUSE OF NERVE DAMAGE. I AM IN CONSTANT PAIN THAT RUNS FROM MY HIP DOWN MY LEGS. I WAS GOING TO GYM REGULAR & BIKE RIDING, NOW I CANT. HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST NO ONE KNOWS, ALL I KNOW IS, THAT LIVING WITH THE PAIN & NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS IS HELL ON EARTH","Hi hun, Please see a neurologist as soon as possible. Also please make sure to smoke weed for the pain! It helped me tremendously!",1
"Im scared to get the booster. I got tinnitus after my j&amp;j shot in April. I want to know if I will get tinnitus again. I saw the audiologist in May and they had no answers. I’m not sure if much has changed since then. I thought my covid shot would protect me for a year. I can’t deal with the thought of having permanent ringing in my ears. Just had to vent. Not antivax.","FDA is allowing mixing of vaccines now. Perhaps for booster get Pfizer.",1
"Don’t get that garbage","What? Ivermectin? You're absolutely right.",1
"What would be the long-term effects of a single resolved bout of myocarditis?","Vaccine myocarditis is usually much more mild than other forms of viral myocarditis but we really don't have the long term data on it. Other forms of myocarditis after resolution don't have pretty outcomes.",1
"Wow! I’m sorry for your loss. I had a dream about a black spot in America the other night and the name included “Reich.” - absolutely wild! I’m allergic to one of the ingredients in the vaccines and I already have like 24 different allergies. It’s definitely not for me.","Oh the old boy died a long time ago. Age got him in the end. I know for a fact he’d of refused the vaccine on the grounds that’s it’s being coerced. I was absolutely fine getting it until they started to use threats and restricting movements.",1
"I had difficulty concentrating and had brain fog and extreme fatigue after second shot","Is it still like that for you?",1
"May I suggest the cesspit that is reddit may not be the best place to receive balanced feedback on what is a very complex and nuanced topic.","Where would you suggest? Reddit seemed like a good way to get some opinions from people who aren't friends and family. I know their opinions and wanted the perspective of others.",1
"Could it be possible your wife was already exposed and has antibodies? My uncle got Pfizer a few months ago and just got COVID. His only symptoms no taste or smell Which improved within a few weeks. He does not regret the vaccine one bit and feels it would’ve been a lot worse if he wasn’t vaxxed.","Perhaps? I have no idea, tbh.",1
"I had the J&amp;J shot in April and it took me down for a few days.  Had the Pfizer booster in early December with minimum side effects.  But that is just my experience.  My wife had the J&amp;J for both and never had any side effects..","Thank you",1
"Vaccines save lives.

Nearly everyone in the hospital and/or dying from covid is unvaccinated.

Vaccines also significantly reduce the potential you will get infected in the first place and reduce the likelihood of long covid.

It's just a fact that the wiser decision is to get vaccinated.","Ok, agree. However if 99.9% people survive Covid is it really necessary to vaccinate then? I’m saying is if it was as bad as Ebola (where lots of people just die) then yes, vaccine would be a life savior. But from Covid? When the chance of dying is les than 1% ?",1
"I’ve experienced swollen lymph nodes here and there in the arm I got the vaccine in, but that’s it.","I've had swollen lymph nodes for over a year with no covid (that I know about. I was sick before cases were reported) and no vaccine. Crazy times.",1
"It's been two months and I'm still in pain. There's no rhyme or reason to it but it's just pelvic pain since the shots","Have you had urinary issues along the pelvic pain too at all?",1
"I think these vaccines cause a lot inflammation. So, there is probably is some gut inflammation. I got some help with Pepto Bismol. I did not have nausea but had gastritis and frequent need for the bathroom. Pepto has an aspirin product so it could help with inflammation. There are a lot of prescription anti nausea meds. So, your MD likely could RX something.","Thank you for the reply I will try to and pick up some Pepto bismol tonight It usually happens when I wake up",1
"And what did your doctor say?","He said I needed to come back in for more tests. I have follow up appointments in 2 weeks.",1
"I also had covid in Jan and still got the vaccine because my mom said we should (my whole fam had covid).  Nothing from our public health said not to either. No clue","How did you feel after the vaccine? I heard people who had COVID but then got vaxxed had worse reactions. Not sure how true that is, though.",1
"I think there are more legal or bureaucratic issues involved in firing faculty, especially tenured faculty, than there are with denying admission to students, a requirement for faculty would be much harder to implement","I agree with everything that you said, but my point remains is that it should be optional for everyone then. It is very hypocritical and a very poor outlook. Also, it is a little bit more then just denying admission for incoming students, its expelling current students.",1
"I do. I had an X-ray, ultrasound and CT done.  They referred me to an oncologist to be sure.  Did a PET scan and it was negative.  I get to do a follow up ultrasound in a few months but basically it’s nothing but a swollen lymph node and nothing to be concerned about.","Really? How large was yours. I have had lots of bloods done but really no imaging. My doc said I could get a biopsy if I really wanted to be sure.",1
"I got mine at 29 years of age (normal range BMI/active lifestyle). A week after vaccine went to ER for heart palpitations (never had them before so I was nervous). I still have them and the feeling is constant.I use to never have heart burn / acid reflux - I get it daily now.","Hey! I had a similar experience - consulted 2 weeks after the vaccine, sent to the ER for heart palpitations/arrhythmia, told it's ""JuSt AnXiEtY"" and now have daily palpitations and acid reflux. What did they tell you at the ER?",1
"Hey, I wanted to reassure you because I had commented in here after I got the Pfizer shots that my cycle had vanished as well. It fully skipped, and the next one after that was still late. Thankfully it was temporary! It just took a few extra months for me to be back to normal. I agree with asking your doctor if you should take the next pill on schedule. I’ve seen it explained that hormones are heavily affected by our immune system, and the vaccine creates such a strong immune response that it throws us out of whack for a while :)","Mine started lol woooo!",1
"How was your first shot","0 symptoms",1
"A friend of mine who had Pfizer had a very similar reaction on a very similar, delayed time frame like yours. The symptoms were gone the next day. He got tested for Covid as a precaution and the test came back negative. So it can happen, for sure.I would recommend getting tested for Covid though, just to be sure.","My symptoms have lasted for 3 days now (today being the 3rd). I went to take a covid test just now just gotta wait on the results. The nurse told me that delayed reactions can happen and I probably have that going on but damn, it sucks",1
"I was in bed for 2 weeks with headache body pain and a fever too close to 104. Then upset stomach. Was very upset.","2nd shot caused this",1
"Depending on your country, you maybe over reacting","I’m in the us. Some guy from the pentagon said once the fda approves it will me mandatory for all soldiers",1
"My wife’s friend also had a similar situation a few weeks after 2nd Pfizer vaccine.She and her family came down with COVID (her husband was also 2nd vaxxed).   For her, it was a very short 1 day mild fever, however she did still lose sense of taste and smell (now 4 weeks later it hasn’t returned).   Anecdotally, I’m sure you’ll be fine, though your experience is incredibly valuable right now if you can share how things go?   I feel like this info is kind of slipping through the cracks when the narrative is to simply return to normal.","Loss of smell and taste means the N-protein from the virus was able to infiltrate/attack her CNS. Vaccine only protects for S-protein to potentially stop us from getting it all together, but if successful, can still lead to issues. Not a doctor but things that increase BDNF or potentially even NAC may help. But it’s likely the reason why Biogen’s questionable alzheimers drug was given FDA approval, because the N-protein has been shown to increase amyloid beta plaques that cause said diseases. Which is why it was mentioned from the very beginning that you may experience encephalitis, dementia, etc.",1
"Did your pain/breathlessness get worse with exercise?I’ve been having sharp pains in my chest beginning three weeks after my second dose of Pfizer. It’s very off/on, and it NEVER happens during exercise. Only after… Mostly at rest.I’ve also been having a few palpitations per day.","I have not exercised much since so I am not sure.",1
"Oh wow never knew how to tell you have gallbladder pain but I think I might have that. Really bad abdominal cramps and my back hurts like a bitch. Also went to the toilet and it was bile. Just got my second moderna dose 4 days ago. How serious is this","Mine resolved but honestly idk",1
"I had nerve pain and took Nervive for about 2 months and it subsided.  Its over the counter and just like a bunch of B vitamins.  I also took apple cider gummies and Im still taking them.  I know its not exactly the same but someone else mentioned nerve pain medication and this is a accessible solution if you are looking for something like that.  It took time to fade but it did.  Good luck.","Which nervive?  There are a couple different products.",1
"I had gum pain after the first Pfizer shot but I have crowded teeth and TMJ so I assumed the inflammation from the shot flared it. It went away the next day.","Interesting, mine started 2 weeks after first shot and hasn’t gone away.",1
"Lol yup the day after is where it hits. Funnily enough the side effects kinda just flip off at some point in the day, at least for me. Just keep water on hand and some nice movies to watch :)","The same happened to me after dose 1, my arm hurt until it suddenly didnt lol",1
"Did you have the option to get a booster or full shot? I got J&amp;J, but have a weak immune system and hoping to get the full dose when I get my Pfizer shot this week.","I did not have an option. The Pfizer dose might be full though?",1
"I had some tingling in my right cheek for a few weeks  after the vaccine. I saw my rheumatologist and she said if it persists to see a neurologist. It went away eventually and I’m fine now. Even if it is Bell’s palsy I’m pretty sure you can recover from that. I’d contact your primary care doctor and let them know what your experiencing. They will guide you from there.","Thank you! It's reassuring to know that",1
"Up to two weeks is still considered normal.","thanks  , i thought the first 4 days are the side effects and then you should be fine  , or if you still got side effects after the 4 days  is abnormal and need to call doctor.",1
"My 26 y/o female coworker is having these exact issues. she tried some natural garlic drops and it helped so much.","I’ll look into getting some garlic drops for sure. I’ve also ordered a turmeric and garlic bone broth I’m hoping will help",1
"Yes, you can. If you're concerned, you can ask the immunizer beforehand.","Thank you! There just doesn't seem to be anyone willing to answer. I guess I'm just concerned something bad may happen because I didn't follow the timeline they laid out.",1
"I got j&j back in May and now I get my period every 3 weeks.","Thanks for your feedback! I will see if mine happeneds every 3 weeks now too",1
"I'm not getting me second dose. I haven't needed a sick day since I started my job in a year and a half untill I got my first dose. I was getting really dizzy, (started 12 hours after I got my shot), out of breath super quick, super high fever (wasn't allowed back at work until it went away, 5 days after my first jab), major brain fog. My job is dangerous so I wasn't allowed to perform my normal duties until the vertigo went away, which took a couple of weeks.","Hey. I also took the first dose (even tho I felt my gut feeling was against it), and I have felt weak and sick for around 5 days now. I don’t know the truth about the vaccine and all that but I would go with my gut feeling if I had the choice to do it over again, and not take the vaccine because I was afraid of what people would think of me if I did not take it, including my family. I find it hard to make a deciscion, I don’t have a lot of trust for the governments and big companies. At this moment I feel like not taking the second dose, and hoping that the first dose I took won’t be noticable in the future.",1
"For lack of better terms, can I catch mRNA? Like Is it sexually transmitted? Im not getting the vaccine, but can the mRNA blueprint that causes cells to produce the spike protein transmit to me from a vaccinated person? What about blood transfusions?","Well your body is full of mRNA and you don't catch the mRNA from other people :) I'm not sure mRNA from the vaccine would be present in blood transfusion and even so, it's a very fragile molecule that really doesn't last long. It's kinda like a Snapchat, once the cell used it, it's destroyed.",1
"For some people the vaccine causes a auto-immune response. Your immune system attacks your own cells. Please go to emergency and tell them the situation.","Any documentation of this? Not challenging you I’m just curious.",1
"I'm experiencing the same thing. I even had an appointment, but then got an anxiety attack the day before and cancelled it. Now I'm looking for a new appointment maybe in about 10 days, but I'm still anxious. I don't even know why. Like I got other vaccines and everything was fine. The only thing then was my slight fear of needles.","Ahh I also had a fear of needles.. and my anxiety is so bad right now! I'm planning to take the shot at my near by CVS pharmacy and I'm so nervous... I can't put it off any longer and I have two kids and I want them to be safe. But I keep thinking about the blood clots and everything that could go wrong..",1
"I work in Community Health and we have vaccinated nearly 90% of our staff with Moderna. While it wasn't a common side effect, we did have 4 employees that reported they experienced some pretty bad hair loss within a few weeks of the vaccine that had no prior issues with hair loss. Not as bad as 70%, but it was enough for them to be concerned and our physicians determined that yes, it was due to the vaccine.","Thank you very much for your post. Do you know whether your coworkers got the hair loss under control and if so how and when did it stop? My own condition unfortunately continues to deteriorate. By now I developed a rash on my neck and I rapidly lose weight while there is no change in diet. I am back at the doctor next week.",1

"Well according to the majority of our authorities and the vast majority of the people on the main coronavirus sub, you should go buy a lottery ticket because the statistical likelihood of this happening is like winning the powerball. Your either lying, someone else is lying or you have really good/bad luck. I think your story is important and relevant and wish you and the family well.","Check their post history. It’s likely they’re lying. They bitched about having Covid six months ago. Now that’s not to say that they did get a variant. Especially since they through all safety and precaution measures out the window. People need to realize that vaccines protect you but they aren’t 100% until we reach herd immunity. It’s like wearing a jacket in a hurricane and then getting mad when the hurricane knocks them down and flash floods carry them away lol. OP was super irresponsible despite getting the vaccine. That’s the *only* thing they were responsible about, if they even truly got it at least.",1

But it could be due to weather, lifestyle or immune system reactions directly after the vaccine. So we would need larger samples and a longer term study to truly see, no?","I was saying that calling vaccination ""forced sterilization"" is inaccurate. Even with a small data pool, if it truly caused sterilization (which it does not), we would see that reflected in at least 1 participant of the study",1
"As far as I know, there's no recommendation for a third shot. Your initial J&amp;J will have laid a foundation. Your Moderna jab will ""prod"" your immune system to a greater response, based on that first J&amp;J shot. Especially if you are in the window of 4-6 months after the initial shot. Some countries that had considered adding a second booster have since reversed course because the incremental benefit was so small. It's far more important for them to focus their efforts on the unvaccinated.Unless you are on immunosuppressant drugs or have an underlying health condition that puts you in a high-risk category, you're good. With two vaccines under your belt, your risk is *very low* for a serious infection.","Thank you!",1

"No, if you stuck Advil label dosage fine. I was vaccinated in March. I woke with a swollen toe and took 2 Advil at 9am and vaccinated at 2. The vax site was at NFL stadium and had to walk 5 blocks. Still had a strong response. I had not heard of this advice until a week after my 2nd shot.One good thing with 2 shot regime is it covers up for any errors. I think CDC just wanted discourage people from taking 6 aspirin 5 minutes before being vaccinated.","Yeah I only had 1 Advil dose prior, so I should be good then, thank you!",1
"The heart beat being up is concerning. The other side effects are probably normal for the shot. I would recommend that you either set up an appointment with your GP soon or go to urgent care just to have them take a look at you. I believe the biggest issue with the J&J shot are blood clots. You would be looking for discoloration in your skin (blue/red/brownish even), general pain in an area that you can't explain (it will usually hurt pretty bad) dizziness or lightheadedness, it might be hard to catch your breath and I believe a rapid or weak pulse depending on where the blockage is. Sometimes you don't get all of those at once. It depends on where the clot is and the severity. Some people have a clot in them for weeks and don't even realize it or don't put the symptoms together.","It is insane, my heart beat even today is still about 100 bpm when I'm just laying down, sitting, or sleeping. The only time when my heartbeat was like that was when I gained 30 pounds in 3 months. But I lost about 50 pounds since then and my heartbeat had always been normal after losing weight, like around 70-80 bpm. Should I be concerned? It is also very hard to catch my breath. I am also way more tired than usual. This never happened before the vaccine and I'm in college now stressed out :(",1

"Yall saying 2 days, they must have fucked mine up, it took at least 2 weeks for the soreness to go away for me, but all my symptoms were exaggerated from what the person giving me the shot said, which I assumed. I'm assuming theres something about me or my lifestyle that made me feel it more. Or because it was the J&amp;J","Todays the 2nd day and it’s already much more mild.

"How long has it been? I have seen a few people say they did and had no side effects on the second round. I hope some will chime in. I’m still trying to decide myself, but my dr thought I should postpone and then get it eventually. It’s been 9 weeks and I only have very intermittent light tingles remaining and a bit of tinnitus which thankfully seems to be improving now as well.I would like to be fully vaccinated for traveling. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine and no one else I know had anything like this. It’s so hard to know what to do. I did have Covid already so I believe with one dose I should be pretty well protected but I wish they would just come out and say one dose is enough.","It's been six weeks at this stage. I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with some side effects for so long yourself but relieved that things are getting better.I share the same thoughts as you - I really want to be registered as fully vaccinated but the thought of having to deal with all of these debilitating side effects again really unsettles me. I've heard that some countries have extended the gap between the two doses as it's associated with a stronger immune response but I wonder what this means for us? What if waiting longer means that these side effects come back stronger the second time around?",1

"Thanks for the update.I got my 2nd dose of Pfizer back in late February. A week later my entire world turned upside down with random symptoms. I’m still dealing with anxiety and other symptoms almost 6 months after my 2nd dose. I’ve gotten much bette overall, but when whatever that is happening to me flares up, it’s like being in hell with anxiety, tingling, headaches, dizziness, vertigo, my breathing gets super deep and slow, but nothing that really triggers me as to why it comes. Mentally, aside from feeling annoyed and angry, I’m not really scared about anything. I’ll try the antihistamine diet to see if that helps me. It’ll probably be just time unfortunately until I’m back to my pre-vaccine self, in which I’ve never had these issues before in my entire 34 years of life","Have your issues begun to resolve? It sounds like time heals. I hope you are feeling better!",1

Along with some headaches every now and then for 2 weeks. Currently, none of those side effects still remain and hoping it stays that way.I feel like Im lucky considering both my parents got side effects from the vaccines (Astra) that lasted for weeks, especially my dad. Even then, my parents still got their second shot. Nothing changed much, they still suffer slightly from the side effects e.g. headache and chills but far better than before.","I had zero side-effects after my first Pfizer dose.  Your mileage may vary.",1
"Strangely the CDC has never contacted me. How did you answer the ""Health Impact"" questions (be unable to work, be unable to do your normal daily activities, etc.)?I believe they never contacted me because I always answer none of the above for these questions. My symptoms are definitely there but they don't affect my daily activities. Maybe the CDC only cares about symptoms that affect your daily activities.","They said it was because I reported that I got care from a dr because of my symptoms.

A couple of weeks after the shot, and wearing the glasses for screens, it got better and I could see fine again.","not particularly? I'd probably say I spend like an hour or something a day because I live in the country aha I'm glad yours is improving, hopefully it's just a temporary side effect tbh",1
"Me and my husband both got j&amp;j in April he didn't get sick just  muscle aches i did (im irrelevant here, just for sake of the story)Whole family got covid in September he was mildly sick low grade fever, fatigue, headache sore throat.

"I know an 18 years old who had a heart attack 2 days after he got the first shot he lived, my brother-in-law died 2 weeks after getting the 2nd shot along with 2 people who I worked with. The government should test every one for preconditions before they get the shot. But that may cost to much","I'm sad to hear this.

"Did you try some benadryl?","No as I am already prescribed Claritin and Flonase for allergies now. I suppose I could try some Benadryl as well though",1
"Hi there! Yes, you should be able to go to sleep right after getting it. I got both doses late evening and went to sleep very shortly after as I get up for work around 4am. I highly recommend drinking a large glass or two of water before sleeping and when you wake up. Being hydrated after any vaccine is always a good idea. Sleep also is important to your health and immune function, so think of it this way: you’re really helping your body out by letting it rest and the vaccine do it’s work.","Thank you so much, anxiety was getting to me a little too much I just really felt the need to ask, but thank you for replying!",1
"I had tongue pain and that burned-pizza sensation across my tongue for about three months after my first dose.  I get the tongue pain 1-2x a month now, and it usually lasts 2-3 days.  I’ve had extensive diagnostic labwork, imaging, etc. done and autoimmune/rheumatological  causes were ruled out.   I was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy and POTs in June, and it was charted as likely vaccine-induced.

"Hey OP. How are you doing now, 6 days later?I'm in the same position. I had a flu shot on 12/9 then Moderna booster on 12/14. On 12/22 I started developing hives all over. Went to the ER yesterday because my throat started feeling tight. They just gave me Benadryl and some steroid. I'm still itchy and tonight my throat is starting to hurt and my lymph nodes in my neck are swollen. I think my immune system is just going haywire. Please tell me things have gotten better for you.","Nite before last i couldnt breathe and called an ambulance. They just gave me benedryl and steriods and sent me home. Today im still a little swollen, slight breathing issues but im ok. I hope you feel better soon.",1
"Virologist here! Although the side effects make you feel crappy, it’s actually a good thing! Your body is mounting a strong immune response, hence why you have a fever and some aches.Hang in there!","Thank you for the response. A little update, I feel much better this morning. Still a little tired, but no fever, chills or body aches :)",1
"I regret to get the pfizer. I got numbness all over body  and head. it almost kills me...","Me too.",1
"Like you, I had the similar reaction from the first dose of pfizer. But it was way better than the 1st dose(since I was having chest discomforts symtops of low blood pressure but it wasn't that bad after 2nd shot).It was kind of bad during on the early days of when I got 2nd vaccine. I started to feel lightheadedness, breathing gets weird, and feeling like I might fall down (mostly in the evenings when walking). And when I look at my heart rate whenever this happens, I noticed that it goes into the 50s and thats when it kicks in. I hardly ever had a low heart rate but after the vaccine, I notice it alot.&amp;#x200B;Its been 2 weeks and its been improving greatly. Give it some time, get some rest (avoid exercising! Until your symtops improve) and as time goes on your symtops will improve on its own. And since you having low blood pressure, try to get up slowly, maybe include some salt in your diet . If the symtops doesnt improve then you should see a docotor.","Hmh I can’t watch my heartbeat the whole time since I’ve reacted allergic to my smartwatch (need another bracelet for it) but remember just sitting at my doctors office casually whilst I felt extremely dizzy again and my heartbeat was 90 beats a minute. Extremely abnormal since I had come by bus and just walked a few meters. Normally my heartbeat goed up to 80 when biking but 90 whilst relaxing? It felt so odd.",1
"Huh, I have a similar profile to you, and a similar reaction to first and second shot, this makes me feel more comfortable about a booster.","Fingers crossed, maybe you will have an easy time too!",1
"How swollen is it and does it hurt? Are you sure it wasn't there before you got the shot? I am on the thin side and have some lymph nodes that I can feel.","No pain, its extremley mobile. I honestly couldn't tell you if it was there prior to shot, I just know it got very swollen and painful post vax.

I hope things work out for you!","How has it been for you? I hope you are doing well.",1
"Yes, I had severe, and I mean SEVERE, nerve pain.  I was bedridden for two months and had to take FMLA leave from work.  It’s now 6 months later and I was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy and POTS.  I didn’t start feeling “better” until months 4/5 after my first dose.  I am still struggling with muscle and extertional fatigue, muscle tightness and spasms, rapid HR, manual breathing, tingling, and numbness.","What was the long term outlook they told you? I developed severe nerve pain, numbness, etc a week after Pfizer, I’m just now seeing what I hope is lasting improvement about 4 months out.",1

"First dose absolutely destroyed my armpit. Was so tender and swollen I could barely put deodorant on.

Sorry you’re going through that :(",1
"My thought would be to look into the excipient list and locate the ingredients. Moderna and Pfizer use polyethylene glycol which some have allergic reactions to. Think plastic allergies or an allergy to Miralax. The johnson and Johnson has polysorbate 80 which is a byproduct of polyethylene glycol and can cause the same allergic reaction. Not saying you're dealing with an allergic reaction. Just that  maybe it can help pin point where and what went wrong.","Question, would people have already come into contact with these substances before having the vaccine and would know they are allergic? Especially if it’s in common things like bowel prep?",1
"What's your age? Stuff like this happens more and more as you get older. I noticed having very excitable nerves behaving this way in my late 20's and it's still with me now in my mid 30's. I also work out avidly and stay in decent shape. I just got my vac recently and it's been a week and I still feel like hot garbage. Gastro, appetite, swollen lymph nodes everywhere especially in my armpits, so swollen I have to keep my arm over my head because my armpit turned into a grapefruit.","I’m 50 … sorry for your pain",1
"I think a lot of people are misunderstanding something in this thread. Yes, it seems that the rate of hospitalizations are generally around the same among COVID cases in vaccinated groups and unvaccinated groups, so it seems the older notion that vaccines will cause you to have a milder illness if you get COVID-19 isn't that true if this data is correct (I think).However, here's the thing - the rate of hospitalizations (severe illness) is the same among **cases of COVID-19**, not among the general population. Vaccination reduces your chance of getting COVID-19 by 95%, so therefore, it ALSO reduces your chance of severe illness by 95%.Let's say there was a population of 100,000 unvaccinated people and they were all thoroughly exposed to COVID-19 and got it, so, 100,000 cases of COVID-19. Let's assume 1% of them died. That'd mean that 1000 people died, right?Now let's say there's a population of 100,000 vaccinated people, and they were all exposed to COVID-19 in the same way. Let's assume the vaccine is 95% effective, so that means 5% of people get COVID-19. 5000 people get COVID-19, which are classified as breakthrough cases. The death rate is still 1%, but it's 1% of the cases - so 1% of 5000, which would be 50 deaths. Catch my drift? If you compare the two death numbers, it actually means that the odds of vaccinated people dying of COVID-19 is 95% lower than unvaccinated people dying from COVID-19. 1000 deaths versus 50 deaths.If there's something I'm misunderstanding, please let me know. Just looking to help!","Thank you! This does ease my nerves a bit. Do they know what went wrong in the remaining 5% for the vaccine not to work? I’m guessing it didn’t create an immune response? Is it typically the person is older (immune system not as good) or immunosuppressive? Or just bad luck?",1
"I read that half a glass of wine is anti-inflammatory, if you can stick to just that much","Right, in order to have a taste and preserve the health benefit of the wine due to the side effect of inflammation. I am abstaining today anyway, too tired from vaccination, was just curious what other drinkers did. Do you drink? Did you drink that day of the vax? if you're vaxed.",1
"I had the same experience as you right after 3rd shot of Moderna. The symptoms should be gone within 48 to 72 hours.","Yeah very similar to my experience with moderna as well except instead of a headache I had severe muscle/joint pain, mostly in my arms and legs. Woke up at 2 am, popped a few ibuprofen and Benadryl to try and get back to sleep, woke up 8 hours later feeling back to 90% and then perfectly normal by the end of the day. It sucks but it doesn’t last long at all",1
"I'm recovered from my adverse reaction and got the flu shot today.  Not going to lie I was scared I think I have ptsd from my moderna experience. But so far totally fine, usual sore arm but nothing much else. I've had a flu shot every year for at least 10 yrs.","Glad to hear that! I haven't been taking flu shots in the last 5 years except last year. It went pretty well!",1
"How old is your sister? Can she consider moving out?","She lives a few hours away for college (she's 21) but has been home for the holidays. She comes back and visits  1-2 times a month normally and will probably expect that same in the new year even though cases are getting worst. She'll be gone in a few days, it just gets me so worked up how immature she is being when our dad's life is on the line. I can't tell if she's just careless, doesn't understand the gravity of the situation, or just thinks she's an exception and won't get it.I just want to know if anyone has any advice about how to deal with this stuff or if it's best to just ignore it since most of what I say doesn't do anything but make ME upset.",1
"I got my second dose of Pfizer 12 days ago and I also have these weird bouts of fatigue and brain fog. It’s like sometimes I just have to lay down. I also try and eat healthy. I track my macros too and I work out pretty regularly.What’s weird to me is that some days it’s better than others. Today I was absolutely destroyed. Could barely get out of bed, and have had a headache all day. I also take vitamin D too. It’s so hard to find answers on this.","Same here. Some days are better than others. 5 weeks since my first pfizer shot. Brain fog and fatigue + restricted breating. I take around 3000 IU vitamin d as well.",1
"I am 64F and got the Moderna booster on Friday, 48 hours ago. I had previously received the J&amp;J vaccine back in March. I opted to get Moderna because I wanted the MRNA booster and it was the first one available. The only side effect from J&amp;J vaccine was some nausea. The only side effect from the Moderna booster is a sore arm which is much better after 2 days. I also got annual flu shot in addition to the  Moderna booster. They were given in different arms. The arm with the Moderna shot was more painful.","Interesting! I considered getting a flu shot at the same time, but didn't want to overwhelm my immune system. My flu shot last year I had nothing, no soreness, no symptoms. Quite a difference from the covid vaccine.",1
"This is not the place to ask. This used to be a sane, measured forum for those seeking vaccine locations, what to expect, should I take off work the next day. After all of those (myself, entire family, all friends and friends of friends) got vaxxed, we left the forum only to watch it devolve into a cesspool of anti vax disinformation. Personally affected by 5 Covid deaths, so I’m obviously going to be the “pro science, pro vaccine” angle, so don’t listen to me either.

"I know you don't want to hear this, but its been 5 weeks for me (on Friday) and no, it hasn't went away. It started popping up in other places in my body over the first 3 weeks, and I developed a mild burning sensation and mild pins and needles (i note mild because the pain for me is not bad enough to require meds, but definitely annoying, disturbing, noticeable). All of these sensations are intermittent, they come and go during the day.  I had a couple days this week where I only had a few instances of tingling during the day but today it was more pronounced. So I don't know if I'm getting better yet. On the upside, it seems all the tests people are having mostly turn up nothing. So not having insurance may not put you at a disadvantage in figuring anything out, unless you require medications. I am having a nerve conduction test and x-rays in a couple days but I'm not expecting to see anything there as my bloodwork was pretty much normal. I'm sorry this is happening and I hope you feel better soon.","I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. It sucks cause you were only trying to do the “right” thing smh.

If you don’t mind the follow up question, could I tell the doctor that I gave the person fake consent without.. going to jail?? In an attempt to not get the doctor who gave me the shot fired?? Also I did talk to them, and they’re willing to wait until the spring to “see what happens” (but tbh I doubt they’d change their minds by then).",1

Today woke up and feel normal.Hope it's done.Btw - I was petrified of getting the vaccine as I had a terrible experience with COVID and did not want to experience those symptoms again.","Yeah, I was scared of vertigo episodes, general dizzines and fainting.

"Yea get the vaccine. Studies have shown that SOME people, not all, but some people’s long haul Covid symptoms are mitigated by getting the vaccine.

The vaccine has extremely rare side effects. As a young woman, avoid getting the J&J, but otherwise you’ll be fine and potentiallly better after your second shot. The first shot typically triggers a stronger immune responses for people who had covid so you will probably feel sick for a few days, or you may not have any side effects at all.","The first part is very true the send part… get the J&J if its what is available but don’t be scared of it. I get there is more fear around it but it also doesn’t wonders. Getting the vaccine is a way to protect your immune system from catching it yet again and sometimes does have the effect(normally after a reaction to the vaccine that normally only last a day) of sometimes making long term COVID effects less and could be if it your current health much more than true chance of it doing anything to hurt you.",1

Not saying it’s normal or is 100% harmless, but it’s also something many, many of us have had to go through. Now, like the other poster said, for some people it has resulted in GBS, but for the vast majority of us it hasn’t gotten worse than just the pins and needles or slightly numb feelings. I’m 5ish months out and still experiencing it from time to time. Others only had 2-3 days of it or 2-3 weeks of it...no ones really sure why. Just stay calm and listen to your body. I never experienced weakness or loss of mobility, and it seems like that’s the main differentiator. If you notice that, definitely time to get it checked out. Just wanted to bring some perspective because it’s not something I had when I was first going through this!","Thanks for sharing this! I was told last night to go to the ER and they gave me a referral to their neurologist, so I’ll see what comes of that appointment.

It caused a flare up of my tinnitus as well, but I also had a concurrent ear infection that was already there, didn’t realize until after the fact, so probably unrelated but maybe caused some inflammation there, didn’t feel 100% until after a week mostly due to health anxiety.","Oh wow do you mixed them?",1

I know it’s been said those that are immunocompromised should get the boosters first - do you need to wait a specific length of time after the second shot though?","Not sure why you got voted down. It’s a legitimate question. I just signed up through a local CVS. They had an option for the 3rd shot and they screen you with some questions about why you’re eligible. That’s pretty much it. The time to wait before the 3rd shot depends. People like me that have weaker immune systems only have to wait a minimum of, I believe, 28 days from the last shot. I’m not certain what the wait time is for the general public is when that roles out. I’ve read conflicting things about that.",1

They make people with a history of allergies wait at the injection site for an hour with a medical team around in case you do react.The person I know with many food allergies have also gotten vaccinated fine, and I imagine you'll find the same story elsewhere.","Thank you for sharing that. I know several people who had skin rash develop days after taking the vaccine. That's beside the point though. It's not about how common certain complications can be. Even if I'm the only person in the world to experience something, it's not going to hurt less. As explained in the post, my body reacts to so many things - it's genetic. On top of that, an undiagnosed type of epilepsy. I think everyone with some empathy can understand my doubts and feeling like I'm a pretty good case for 'potential rare side effects'.If I could, I wouldn't take the vaccine. I don't believe I pose much of a threat to anyone as my social circle is steady and small - everyone except two people have been vaccinated so their chances of landing in a hospital are low.But being denied certain freedoms puts a lot of pressure.

At this point, majority of the employees have gotten vaccinated, but the mask rule will remain in effect as they said they will not ask employees their vaccination status, and will not drop masks for vaccinated vs non vaccinated as they do not want to open themselves up to discrimination of varied vs non vaxxed In reality though, people in conferences sit distanced and will have the meetings without masks on, then put the mask on to walk back to their office.

Unfortunately no meds we’ve tried have made much of an impact other than meds to help him get a full night’s sleep. I’m going to see if his doctor will prescribe colchicine and maybe a beta blocker to see if that helps since his symptoms seem related to heart and/or lung inflammation.

I'm on the short list for the booster (work in healthcare)","I don't know which part of healthcare you work in, but I imagine every single job no matter how ""small"" is incredibly stressful right now. Hope you're doing well and feeling as appreciated as you are!",1
"I personally don't think you should, but if you do, just be sure you do it because you decided it was best for yourself, not because you were coerced.","The thing is I either get it and move on or face punishment under ucmj ( uniform code of military justice)",1
"I think the covid shots can fuck with people with allergies.I have a peanut allergy and the moderna shot caused me an adverse cardiac reaction consisting of chest pain rapid heart rate and heart palpitations of which I am still recovering from 4 months later. Someone I know also had a cardiac adverse reaction from the shot, but it also messed with his allergies and triggered a bunch of new food allergies in him. It also somehow re enflamed his old injuries that had already healed, and as an athlete he had plenty of those so he was a mess. It’s really weird the way it affects some people.Best wishes to your brother I hope he gets better soon. If he ever needs to talk he can hit me up.","Interesting.. isn’t an allergic reaction just a overreaction of an immune response?",1
"Thanks for posting. Why does your dad use your account for his hemp shampoo purchases? Seems like a boundary issue.","Haha it was only cause he didn’t have an Amazon account.",1
"Hi guys! I got my J&J vaccine 5 weeks ago on Aug 12 and I'm having some numbness on the limbs/face, tingling, my thinking and reflexes not 100% the same, pressure in my head and bit of confusion. Have you had similar problems? Did blood test and brain MRI and all good. Really appreciate your support.","How are you doing now? Have you had any weakness? I feel my body not the same, that I lost bit of strenght and reflexes not 100% the same…",1
"Being an Asian, I opted for J&amp;J as their clinical trial data had a lot more persons of color, native Americans, and Alaskans than Moderna or Pfizer. Modera had more specifically Asians than J&amp;J,  native Alaskans share a lot of genetic history with Japanese and Koreans which I am a descendant of so that's why I opted for that. The injection itself was quite unpleasant and it burned quite a bit compared to all the other vaccines I get regularly such as the seasonal flu vaccine.  The actual location of the injection might have been bad with the wrong length of the needle used. Typically they use 25guage, 1-inch needle, 1 mL syringe filled to 500 uL dose. What I saw was a 2-inch needle, but I didn't really question it, felt like it hit the bone and injected on the surface of the bone instead of in the middle of the deltoid muscle. My arm felt dead immediately and my whole arm felt like it was burning for at least several hours, an indication that the needle or the injection fluid barely hit on the auxiliary radial nerve in my arm.  Then had a high fever for 2 days following the vaccine, starting about 12 hours after the injection. Then heavy generalized fatigue and nausea for about 2 weeks, and getting better on my 3rd week.  General mood disruptions more than I'm used to, and a return of my seasonal allergies that I haven't had for over 5 years.  My sore arm has just gotten better the last few days after a more aggressive arm workout and massage treatment.Overall, I think my side effects are still on the milder side compared to what some people experience.... but it could be due to a bad injection techniqe.","Thanks for sharing! May I ask where you got your shot at ?",1
"I had 24/7 spams in the leg of the first injection 3 days after , and for 4 days.Follow by almost 3 months of same side flank pain , rib pain , back pain on the same side. Still feeling it but much less. Did ct scan , blood and urine test and everything came back normal. Did covid test and came back negative. To this day I don't have my answers.","How was the second dose?",1
"What country/state/province are you asking about?","Thank you. I’m in Southern California, specifically San Diego.",1
"I also have a swollen lymph node in the under arm area on the opposite arm of the Pfizer shot. It started nine days after getting the first dose. I waited almost 2.5 months to go see the doctor because it was very sore and would keep me up some nights. They did an ultrasound, mammogram, and want to do a biopsy to rule out anything else going on. The mammogram came back normal but still suggested I do a biopsy. I was supposed to have it done this Monday but cancelled it. I want to wait another 1-2 months and see if it goes down on its own. I do not want to have unnecessary treatment and leave a marker in my body like the suggested. It’s very scary but I don’t want to have an invasive procedure when I believe it is due to the shot.","I understand not wanting to get an unnecessary biopsy, but do not worry about the teeny tiny titanium marker they leave behind. My wife has had one in her breast for years (she had some kind of fibrous growth we thought might be cancer), no issues.",1
"Also had a somewhat bad headache after my first moderna shot, started about 7 days after the shoot, a bit more than a week later the headache is mosty gone, it also switched position all the time and i had a stiff neck on top of it","Tnx, good to know. After 7 days mine has also subsided, at this point it feels like pressure at temples, that I wouldn't necessarily describe as painful. Definetly still scary and unline any other headache I've had before.",1
"Can anyone provide info on periods, being on the pill and the vaccine??I’ve had covid twice and noticed a big difference in my period even though I’m on the pill. Finally made it to get my first dose and now I’m waiting for ny period but have heard it messes it up big time. Nothing online :(","I’m not on the pill, but have an implant. I usually don’t get periods anymore but after my second dose of Moderna, I had some spotting for about a week. I also have read that getting Covid changes your cycle also..",1
"Hi - yes.  I had similar sensations, radiating to my back, left shoulder blade.  Had all the tests done for heart stuff, EKG, echo, stress test, blood work.  They haven't found anything. They think its likely muscloskeletal inflammation as I had other probelms around my body like joint and muscle aches.  This could be true for you too - but get it cleared from your cardiologist first!","Did they give you any meds for it or told you if it will resolve?",1
"Really quick question: do you remember having slight moments like this before the vax? Sometimes i randomly get weird sharp pains (21m) and maybe even a palpitation, and I am afraid they will get worse after i get the vax.","I don't remember ever having heart palpitations. The sensation was new to me so it took me a while to figure out what it was.I used to have some minor chest pain occasionally, but I haven't really felt it in over a year now. Doesn't seem related for me. I think it might have been some minor costochondritis but never got it checked.",1
"i have pericarditis, 28M, no underlying conditions from covid or my vaccination - unclear which caused iti wish there was data on cased of covid induced heart inflammation","Sorry to hear that. I haven’t done an extensive literature search, but I’m sure someone is working on that. It doesn’t seem to have incidence of myocarditis due to covid in non-hospitalized patients though.",1
"Just a question … I’m neutral on the vaccine. Do any of you feel concerned that all of you whom have taken this vaccine all have these issues?","I wont get booster for sure. I am not going to say how other shohld act. At this point I dont care.",1
"I am experiencing, amongst.other symptoms, chest pains (heart), heart palpitations and stomach pains/burning. I've had numerous blood tests, ECG and chest x-ray, all normal. Reading your story makes me think my chest issues could be stomach related? Can I ask what medication you have been given and what, if any, supplements help? I have had gastro issues in the past, particularly after a change of diet, so it could all be related. Thanks","So sorry to hear about your experience! My doctor gave me two weeks of Omeprazole (20mg) I saw a huge improvement at day 3! Chest pain is rare now. Maybe once a day, if that.",1
"Thank you. Personally, I also got the J&amp;J about a week before the pause happened back in March. I did get Covid this September. Talked to my doctor this past Wednesday and she recommended Moderna booster over Pfizer. Just need to figure out where to get it.","How was your covid experience? Was it mild now that you are vaccinated?",1
"Certainly your parents have the best intentions & just want you to be safe. But at the end of the day you are an adult & the decision is yours alone to make.

"My shoulder still hurts 6 weeks later.  Prob improper vaccination technique but you might want to go to doc.  Mine is much better now …","That’s good to hear, glad you’re doing better! I’m hoping it’ll go away. It’s very dull, but discomfort that wasn’t there nonetheless.",1
"Had both vaccines and haven’t had a period. Have done multiple pregnancy tests and nothing. Seeing Dr tomorrow’s literally been almost 3 months without one.

I'm drinking water like I'm running a half marathon",1
"Yes it’s happening to me for five weeks+ now. Everyone thinks I’m just lazy or depressed when it’s not that at all. Cant work or find energy at all to do anything. This crucifixion of people knowing they’re getting strong side effects is insane though. Sorry for anyone else also surrounded by morons.","I feel you!! I am on sick leave because of it and everyone thinks I am depressed because naaaah that can't be an effect of the vaccination. I know it better. Thank you for your comment!",1
"Does it feel like a thump, like your heart randomly “thumps” in your chest?","Yes, exactly this",1
"Same boat buddy.  I just started getting this numbing sensation in my legs from sitting for a few minutes.  I started taking Bayer aspirin because I was afraid a blood clot was forming.  Your symptoms are exactly what I have been feeling since I took the Vaccine.  My second dose date was back in April.","Ive been dealing with mysterious numbing on my outer thigh, vaccinated in march with pfizer. Sometimes feels like a burn. Wonder what it is?",1

"I had severe joint and muscle pain for two months.  I’ve seen several specialists and visited the ER 3x.  Unfortunately, no one has answers.  I was thrown several different medications, including Prednisone, Medrol, and Gabapentin, among various different painkillers and muscle relaxants (I did not continue taking most of these because they weren’t helping).  Please report this.  I am doing much better, but still have severe muscle fatigue, elevated HR, intermittent burning/tingling/weakness, and a horrible sensation in my throat that feels like someone is choking me.

"Yes!! I also had positive d-dimer blood test but all my tests came back clear.So confused and worried. Did yours get any better?","Hi! Yep, felt better after a few days of taking a PPI prescribed at the hospital. So, it turns out it was reflux.  Interesting you had a positive d-dimer but tests normal. What was their explanation for this?",1
"It would have to be presented by the cell to elicit an antibody response.  Or the spike protein is free in the circulation, depending on where the lipid nanoparticles are carried because a Japan study shows that it does not just stay at the injection site .","Does that mean pieces of spike protein are just floating around outside the cell? Or do they become part of the cell wall?",1
"It makes zero sense that he would develop lymphoma from the vaccine, especially in such a short interval after vaccination. He likely had lymphoma before getting vaccinated and it was detected around the time of his vaccination. If someone can explain to me how a blood cancer would be causes by a RNA vaccination, id like to know.","honestly i don't know how i am not an expert.

I don't think anyone is an expert at this vaccine because it is only a year old. Unless you can say someone who studied something for an year is an expert.

My curiosity lies in the fact that NOBODY in the US talks about this. whether this is caused by the vaccine or not, once you are put in this situation you will question what if, what if the vaccine caused it. And either people in the US are too scared to talk about it or it is censored or it just doesn't happen.",1
"If its anything like mine it will go away. I had a low grade fever (99-100F) for 10 days after my first Pfizer shot and had it come back a few times after that. It's a week past my second shot now and my temperature has been normal.","Thanks for your reply. Did you get another round of low grade fever after the second shot?",1
"Sure. You are asking questions on a forum stalked by anti vax lunatics. Just look at simple math. In the US, an estimated 50 million cases, and 800k deaths vs hundreds of millions of doses administered and a few thousand deaths reported, of which it is nearly negligible when you look at the cases where death was proven as a result in a rare reaction, as opposed to coincidental. To quote the covid deniers- did with the vaccine as opposed to from it.","A few thousand people in the US have absolutely, positively not died from getting vaccinated.

The number is far smaller than that.",1
"Anyone knows about the myocarditis stats in Japan?","The stats won't matter as the sample size is kind of small in Japan. Not many Japanese people are willing to take the vaccines.",1
"First off, I can’t speak to the specific changes you’re talking about here...33 year old man here. So, I can’t really comment on anything related to cycle changes. But I think for a lot of people, myself included, it’s because many of the symptoms we experience, even if they start several days after a dose, are things we’ve never experienced in our lives. This also contributes to them being even more alarming. Never in my life have I experienced numbness, tingling, ice pick headaches and light sensitivity all at the same time....for 8+ weeks now. You’ll also see many people also preface by saying they’re normally very healthy...I was. No allergies, no other conditions that could explain it (diabetes, autoimmune disorders, etc), very healthy weight, active, etc. There are people with those types of things who are also having reactions to the vaccines...but many of the users I’ve talked to have nothing like that that could also explain what they’re experiencing. Most of us have never had anything like this happen before.Finally, you’ll see many, many people explain that they’ve had bloodwork, MRI’s, nerve conduction tests...all of which would show many of the other things these symptoms could be attributed to. Nothing has shown up on any of the tests I’ve taken. When your PCP and neurologist both shake their heads independently and say they don’t have any other explanations, that has me 100% convinced it’s vaccine-related.","I've also had troubles with numbness and tingling. Would you mind sharing where you've experienced these sensations? Mine have been the arm of the injection site and my neck/cheek area. I'm curious if others have had the same problems as me.",1
"There are reamsof explanations of the covid vaccines, or simply, how a vaccine works (in general too) ,  for every kind of \*learner\* and \*learning style\*.   (Research papers, scientific explanations, as well as the simpler ""graphics, pictures, icons and cartoon"" portrayals.IF you can read and understand most highway signs, then there is a graphic for vaccines that simplifies the concepts.At this point, if someone does not undestand what a vaccine does, with all that at their fingertips, then I don't know if further ""analogies"" is going to help at all.  TL;DR especially.     But hey, more power to you if you need to try this hard for somebody that you know or something like that.","Thanks. I wish an analogy weren't necessary, but, hey, it seems to be working... I just wanted to make sure I wasn't way off base.",1
"If you’re 40, in decent shape, with no preexisting conditions, I’d tell you not to bother. Look up the death rates for your age and health cohort and do the math yourself.","Thank you for that but I’m not really looking for a “right” answerI to get vaccinated or not. I really don’t think I’ll die if I get it. But I might miss 2 weeks of work, which means my husband would miss at least a week to care for our kids, plus messing with quarantine, having a higher chance of passing it on to someone else, long haul symptoms, etc. I’m more curious as to what people think could happen years down the road from getting the vaccine.",1
"I just got the Modena and I had a bad reaction. I’ve been sick for a week. Because I listened to people like you","That sucks, but it’s normal. It will pass. It’s not permanent. It’s actually a very good sign that your immune system is working correctly.",1
"I see an allergy specialist who said their patients did well with Pfizer. I think the US CDC has a help line. I have not called but maybe see if they have some help.","Ah I will definitely check it out, thank you!(:",1
"I think it might be true I haven’t been able to sleep for 2 days I’m so anxious I can’t, honestly freaking out","How are you doing now?",1
"Really sorry you’re having such bad side effects.  I had horrible side effects for eight weeks but they finally went away.  I don’t regret getting vaccinated, but I do wish the CDC advised us of up front because I’m pretty sure some people in the trials also suffered.Best wishes.","Same. Massive compression headaches since my second moderna May 25th. Currently on indomethacin, which works, but trying to get off it.",1
"Hopefully it’ll level out soon and dissipate. Until then, definitely give fasting a try. It has many benefits and is a great reset for the body. Also, maybe try a supplement called NAC. A lot of people are using it for vaccine reactions, for long covid and during covid. Maybe Quercitin too. Also green tea for its antioxidant benefits? And I know it’s controversial, but maybe ivermectin. It helps eliminate the spike protein which is likely the culprit. And maybe a keto diet to regulate blood sugar. It will keep your insulin very stable and keeps you less hungry so maybe that’d help. What’s your name? I’ll pray for you that you get relief very soon.","Thank you so much for the response! I truly approcate it. I'm going to look into the stuff you mentioned. I just ate dinner and plan to do the water fasting for 24 hours and see how I feel. My name is Ben thank you so so much for the info!",1
"Yup! I got blood samples too that came back fine. I’ve had this happen before from other things though, and I’m thinking it could be from my immune system being stressed from working a lot due to the shot or from the stress and anxiety related to getting the shot. I’m just keeping an eye on it and seeing if it’ll regulate itself again. Really hope you can work this out! It is definitely not fun and really frustrating.","You have no idea what a relief it is to hear someone else say this; thank you!",1
"That's not normal in any circumstance. I'd be in the ER like yesterday...","I will call my doctor as soon as they open in about an hour. I am just confused because the corona hotline told me that its still normal. Hope it will get better soon!",1
"The Covid vaccine is not against the Christian faith. It might be against YOUR belief, but that has nothing to do with God or the Bible.","So the bible condones abortions, then using the fetal cells from those aborted babies for scientific research and/or medical advancement?",1
"I had tinnitus after the first shot. Continuous and loud for a day or two then over time got intermittent and less severe.Hope yours gets milder or disappears soon!","Thanks so much!",1
"I'd like to also relieve some of your anxiety. Got my second dose of Pfizer on August 19th.I woke up to a tender and swollen arm pit 2 days later on August 21st. The funny thing is the lump itself is not the tender part since I press on it and feel no pain what so ever. It's soft. The parts that are tender are the edges of the arm pit that connect to my pec as if the tendons/muscles near may be inflamed? I found that stretches for the chest and arm relieve the tightness and tenderness in the area. Hot showers too! It does not feel as tender as it did now 7 days later and the swelling looks a bit the same if not just a tad bit smaller.The pins and needles feeling is also something I've felt in my vaccinated arm, upper traps, and groin area. They are in a very small area and very mild. I massage the spot to stimulate the nerves. My vaccinated arm did feel fuzzy, or like, tingly at times and I stretch it out whenever that happens. Could be minor nerve inflammation as our body mounts a immune response? I've seen others comment about this symptom. I drink green tea and take turmeric to help the body some.","Its been 6 days its currently the 28th of August, the days that followed just my arm itching and hot, yesterday was the first day i actually felt ok, not hot itchy arm and the swelling has gone down, the little ball in my arm pit has also disappeared, for me it was the muscles around the armpit aswell, the little ball hurt a little if i pushed it of course but i let it be. I did take showers but found it only made my arm more hot and itchy afterwards.Its summer where i am so tea is a no thankyou hahaha but i did drink alot of electrolytes and water, plus i took multivitamins aswell to help. Im glad that my symptoms are somewhat 'normal' i was worried about the lymph node but all is well now and im good 6 days later",1
"Please do. I’ve seen young healthy adults dying in the ICU…every single one of whom was unvaccinated.","What ICU do you work in?",1
"You have been vaccine injured, this is more common than most have been led to believe. Please share your experience to raise awareness before further booster shots are mandated.","What do you mean by vaccine injured? Does that refer to a severe reaction of the immunity system or something else? I'm asking because I know someone who's taken their first shot a week ago and he's suffering from terrible GI issues now.",1
"I really don't have any advise but just want to say that I am sorry that you are in this position.","Thanks, I guess I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed having to chose what to do, and I only have till next Monday to decide because that's the deadline for vaccinations.",1
"Listen to the Doctor!!","He is, but he’s getting pressure from his employer to get vaccinated. He also cannot travel overseas many places without the vaccine. The doctor will not write him a note.",1
"Yeah I called my doc about armpit pains etc, and he said post vax for up to 2 weeks your lymph nodes can just be inflamed a bit and hurt in the areas that they are, said it’s a common occurrence he noticed with some patients that also were concerned","Ok well that’s interesting, I’m coming up on 2 weeks Sunday so I hope it improves but I could understand it taking a little longer, thanks for the teply",1
"When I got my 1st Moderna shot I just experienced moderate shivers and a low fever in the eveningBut the night of my 2 shot was the worst 4 hours I have experienced in my whole life, it started with shivers and feeling cold which then transitioned into  involuntary shaking followed by a headache, 1 hour later I started having severe convulsion, the worst migraine I‘ve ever had, extreme cold, extreme sweating, unbearable pain theoughout every fibre of my body while crying through all 4 hours that it happened. I rarely cry and have never cried because of painIm generally pro vaccine and still am, but Im truly traumatized by that experience and will never get a Covid shot againEDIT: I‘ve browsed the web for these symptoms but never found anyone sharing my experience so the likelyhood of this happening to you is very slight","Whats your plan against covid?",1
"The testing isn’t reliable. I think it’s best to quarantine if someone in your house is positive, whether you test positive or not. Unfortunately this is not the advice that’s been given, and I’m sure greatly contributed to the bad delta wave. I’ve spoken to *many* people that were told by their doctors that they did not have to stay home from work when their spouse was home sick with covid, just because they were vaccinated…and then they end up sick a few days later and exposed their workplace. You kind of didn’t do anything wrong, because it’s not your fault. The public health guidance just isn’t the best, because they’ve been trying to “reward” vaccinated people and make them feel invisible by giving them as few restrictions as possible.","And i do know these tests aren’t always reliable, this particular one in the fine print says it’s 99% accurate in detecting a negative test and 83% accurate in detecting a positive.
