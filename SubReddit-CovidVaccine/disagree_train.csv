"If you're not at serious risk of covid don't get it -- you don't owe anyone to compromise your health for theirs","But the propoganda and collaborative fear says I owe my health for the sake of others right now, ya know? It's something I've never faced before. But I'm 30 and healthy and don't go out in groups or to clubs or anything anymore and I was forced to isolate in one room the entire year for a family I nannied for. Didn't go a SINGLE PLACE FOR A YEAR. I want to feel like that was doing my part! But I had to quit my job because they wanted me to get the vaccine the day it was out and would never drop it.

"The protection is not “all or nothing” - it’s not 100%…but it is estimated at 96%+.  That means there will be breakthrough cases, but even then, the vax provides protection by drastically reducing hospitalization and death.","Is it safe to say that this 96% or 95% or whatever high number is now much lower due to the new variants?

"Yes a vaccinated person can still spread the virus but only if they get it first. And with the vaccine you’re 90% protected so in the 10% chance you get COVID you can spread it. But there’s a 90% chance you don’t get it.

"It is *extraordinarily* unlikely that a vaccinated person died from COVID unless the vaccine didn't work for them","How are you still parroting this nonsense after all these weeks when the evidence to the contrary grows stronger every day...The rate of fully vaccinated individuals that require hospitalization after reinfection with covid-19 is 7% according to stats published by the CDC.The rate of hospitalized individuals in the general public is 3-5%At first that could easily be shrugged off as being related to the disproportionate number of elderly vacinees and their weaker immune systems.But now that so many people in all age groups have been vaccinated, the stats are still holding strong and we have seriously strong evidence that the vaccines aren't providing a significant reduction to the burden on our Healthcare systems.Add to that the fact that the edit: 1.351 variant (which is becoming more and more prevalent) is able to evade pfizer and moderna induced antigens and your statement it blatantly false.",0
"Your case has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the vaccine. Your relative was unvaccinated.

The numbers speak for themselves. The overwhelming majority (~95-99%) of deaths and patients in the ICU are unvaccinated.

"In Chile, it looks like 60% have had one dose, with 46% being fully vaccinated. Article states that vast majority of infections and hospitalizations are coming from non-vaccinated folks, who are unfortunately slowing down the end of the pandemic for everyone.Still, I think Chile's vaccine numbers should be nearing herd immunity, especially if they get some more people a second shot. They will have roughly the same vaccination rate as Israel, who pretty much has accomplished herd immunity. However, if you compare Israel's vaccine charts w/ Chile, Israel ramped up way faster and a lot earlier (which makes sense, because they started giving shots well before most countries)Israel hit 50% first doses on Feb 24 vs. Chile hitting 50% on May 24.Within a month or two, I would expect to see Chile's COVID cases and deaths start to plummet.But I hear you, as someone who got my shot too, I'd be really frustrated about the lockdowns. I think it's a balancing act where countries feel they've almost made it to the finish line, and don't want some variant or outbreak to ruin everything.","The UK covid numbers are concerning because their vaccination rates are very high and their positivity numbers are going up again.

"This is a normal reaction that I think is a lot scarier when you haven’t dealt with severe anxiety or don’t know anyone who has dealt with severe anxiety. The covid vaccine along with other vaccines can cause your brain to panic because building that immunity basically tells your brain that something is wrong. You panic, your heart rate increases, you can have heart palpitations, muscle pain, etc. because that anxiety can cause physical symptoms. Myself, and others I know with anxiety, have had periods of time where that panic essentially doesn’t go away from days to months at a time. It is really terrifying when you first experience it but as long as your tests are coming back normal then that’s likely all it is. I got my first covid shot and after six hours I began experiencing that same exact thing. Even if you don’t typically deal with anxiety, this can happen.

"Here is a link where you can predict the chances that you'll be hospitalized if you catch covid. Average hospitlization will cost, what, 20k? So your choice appears to be a) get a vaccine and feel ""off"" for a day or 2., b) live in your parent's basement so you won't get covid at all or c) catch covid and have an 5-10% of being hospitalized, where you'll have to shell out thousands upon thousands of dollars. Not to mention, I know plenty of single people who won't date people who aren't vaccinated. And not just because they don't wanna get infected by you. Who the hell wants to date someone who only thinks of themselves? Who won't take a shot to help protect grandma?","What’re you talking about. You can still spread covid with the vaccine. It’s not selfish to not be vaxxed. Some of us are masking up consistently, avoiding gatherings, taking zinc, vitamin C, D and whatever else to help our bodies handle it. Some people have illnesses that these vaccines can cause reactions in and neither covid or the vaccine would be very fun to get.What I do see is plenty of vaccinated people walking around and gathering in large quantities without masks.

"I enjoy Reddit but have been meaning to leave this sub for awhile BUT actually came back to share my positive experience today, so glad to see your post. This sub is the reason I almost didnt get my shots at all. High health anxiety + automimmune disease + reading the overwhelming HORROR stories only made it worse.  It made me forget that my entire immediate fam got vaxxed and no one was “ill” for more than a day…that my circle of friends got vaxxed and no one was hospitalized or got extremely sick at all. That the MOST common symtoms are NOT super high fever and constant vommiting. I got both Moderna shots and guess what - only had a sore arm and a heachache.  Luck? Or maybe cuz I hydrated well for two weeks, slept well, ate healthy and meditated? I believe that ppl have bad reactions and that’s unfortunate.  But Im THANKFUL that it didnt change my mind. There are so many factors: genetics, LIFESTYLE (some ppl don’t sleep well/eat well or take care of themselves), and eveyone’s threshold is diff (your idea of a sore arm and fatigue is diff from mine). Ppl need to talk to real doctors, actually read the trial data and make grown up decisions for themselves.","The lifestyle correlation isn’t true though. I have noticed this thing where some people like to correlate their healthy lifestyle to a chill outcome.Anecdotal, but I’ve observed among myself and people I know who have been vaccinated, that the very WORST side effects were mine, and I am by far the healthiest person in my group of people. (Just severe flu side effects, but it’s the sickest I’ve been in decades) I am much healthier than an average person in the general public. I feel I can say this with confidence, as I am a fitness instructor, and my livelihood is my health. I work with people’s bodies and have a fairly good feel for the “average” persons physical fitness. Peoples bodies are all so different and complex. Just because *you* happen to have a healthy lifestyle, and had no side effects, does not prove that overall, healthy lifestyles = no side effects.  Correlation is not causation.",0

Real maturity and strength lies in making good choices and doing the best for yourself and people you care about, regardless of peer pressure either way.","You know anyone can take these shots right?

I am not “antivax”—I’ve gotten vaccines before, and I am not entirely opposed to this one either, provided people are allowed to make an informed decision for themselves. Vaccines are a wonderful medical miracle (I shouldn’t even have to say this). But not allowing people the space to question something that they are being pressured by their government to apply to their bodies (regardless of their own personal risk assessment) is only making people more hesitant. Science is not something to be “followed” it is something to be questioned. The more people censor, shame and namecall others for questioning this vaccine or for reporting on the side effects they are personally experiencing (or in many cases SUFFERING from), the more it looks to anyone with an even remotely skeptical mind that something suspicious is going on, *whether it is or is not*. Want to be trusted? Then be transparent, patient, understanding and *tolerant of questions and skepticism*. Far too many advocates of this vaccine are not exemplifying such qualities.

"Lots of different factors come into play and need to be considered when basing your medical decisions on what is known about the myocarditis risk. The answer also depends on the datasets used.It's important to remember that in those who do get myocarditis, 95% resolved with rest and are mild. In the Israel study for example, men aged 12-29 were 4 in 100,000. So non-mild myocarditis would have been 1 in 500,000. When considering this data in relation to your medical decisions you should consult a doctor.Things to be weighed are this risk vs your risk of getting covid, which is almost guaranteed at this point, and your risk of long term complications or myocarditis from getting covid etc.It's a difficult statistical game.","My risk of developing serious complications from the coronavirus as a young, thin, healthy male is very low. My risk of being infected with the coronavirus is also very low in general. Especially due to my lifestyle, like working from home (and loving it), having a small network of friends, introverted hobbies and actively wearing masks, my risk of being infected is very low, perhaps near zero. My risk of developing serious adverse reactions to the vaccines are also very low. However, when I take the vaccine, I intentionally expose myself to that risk, and I am guaranteed that risk. On top of that, the vaccines aren’t even that good. They are not some magical guarantee of immunity, and aren’t as effective as one would expect from a vaccine. On top of that, 2/3 of the vaccines that have been available to me, are now no lingered offered to me because the risk profile is too high. It’s not exactly tempting.",0
"Well, side effects won’t likely kill you. They might cause you to suffer just enough that you wish you were dead. My worst side effect is probably ice pick headaches.

Covid can 100% kill you.

So, really it just boils down to which do you want? Vaccine with its potential side effects or Covid-19.","The chances of it killing a healthy person are less than .001%.",0
"Obviously a fat troll post but it is true that vaccine passports do approximately nothing","not a trollpost",0
"I swear I come to this crap subreddit and see side effects left and right, but in my neighborhood and city for that matter, there hasn't been any people that got major complications. People at the office and school reported a fever at worst. Either the vaccine is only targeting Americans or y'all lying.","Yep you caught us! We're just here for laughs....",0
"Better not to get it. Variants will continue and those who have received MRNA will have weakened ability to fight it without continuous boosters","Can you explain this some more? Some of my family members have made this claim, but I don't see how the vaccine could give you weakened ability to fight variants as opposed to not getting it at all. I know the vaccine's efficacy wanes over time, but wouldn't that just make it ineffective, not harmful in terms of the ability to fight variants?",0
"People your age are suffering with the delta variant. Get that vaxx.","Umm suffering how?",0
"You're far less likely to get covid if you're vaccinated, meaning you're far less likely to pass it because you didn't get it in the first place.","Wrong, it has been proven over and over again that vaxed people still get and pass covid. Sorry the government lied to you and you ate the bullshit.",0
"You aren’t the only one. I’m in the military and am still on the fence about this whole thing. I either get it or face a discharge. The lack of long term studies as well as reading and personally knowing people getting side effects is what’s stopping me. The science may be there but I’d be pretty pissed getting a serious side effect such as myocarditis from something that was forced. I had covid 3 weeks ago and had no symptoms, as well as no lingering side effects from it. My natural immunity as well as staying in pretty decent health is also what deterring me. Maybe I’m lucky.","It is very rare - I have had cancer twice and am immune-compromised so I was not really sure about this. My doctor friend insisted as the long-term effects of the virus are worse so I did - I had a mild headache for a couple of days then nothing. I hope you go ahead and get it for your sake and for your family.",0
"I got it 2 months after I got my J&amp;J shot, basically zero symptoms, hangovers are a million times worse than my Covid experience. Imo, much better than being boosted a million times and still most likely catching it. I'm happy that the vaccine made the virus into a puppy, I got over it, now I don't have to think about boosters and worrying about Pfizer or Moderna destroying my heart.","The risk of getting heart damage from Covid (even if vaccinated once) is still much higher than getting heart damage from mRNA vaccines.",0
"Have a look at this thread and the study it links. It's a preprint study suggesting myocarditis/pericarditis at a rate of around 1 per 1000 mRNA vaccinations in Ottawa.","Wrong again. The study — which was preprint, meaning it hadn’t been peer reviewed — has been withdrawn because the authors admit their numbers grossly inflated the rate of myocarditis.",0
"I think its only fair that you tell your partner that you got vaccinated.","Jw..what makes it unfair if they don’t?",0
"It is a tough decision. I guess you need to look at your risk factors. I developed nerve damage (dr saying small fiber neuropathy) and have continual numbness and weakness from the 1st vaccine. Refuse to get the second. But there are serious and long term risks of getting covid also.","No there aren't.",0
"Why dont YOU show us a data that the vaccine is dangerous instead of spouting off baseless conspiracies and calling everyone sheep? Find a peer-reviewed study that shows that the vaccine's risks are greater than its benefits, AND that its worse than getting COVID. Go ahead.","What the baseless conspiracy? What have I said that can be called conspiracy? I have given evidence that u can't refute. That means it's not baseless.

I don't need a peer review study. That's not the way precious new vaccine and drugs are handled. When there's reports of people dying from a new did we don't wait for double blind placebo prospective studies before we stop the new drug. We stop it and then look into it.

Also there are no such stories for the vaccine.",0
"A discussion is not supposed to put someone's feelings into consideration, you ask a question and you get an answer. The quality of that answer is measured by you, upvote and downvote accordingly... I always downvote people that make getting the vaccine or not a political issue which is unfortunately many.","I think we might just fundamentally disagree on where empathy fits into a discussion, which is okay - my primary point is how much this group has shifted. Other groups related to illness often are more encouraging, as this one once was.",0
"What are the odds of dying with Pfizer? Aren't Pfizer and Astro the same ""science""??????","Nope. The Astra Zeneca vaccine is a different sort of vaccine than Pfizer or Moderna. It's called a viral vector vaccine.",0
"So the vaccine doesn’t even work? I’m not an antivaxxer (I’ve already had one shot), but I don’t understand what the point of a vaccine is if it doesn’t work.","It works, just not 100% of the time.   Time will tell.",0
"Sounds like pleurisy. I've got an immune system disorder and lockdown last year had me stuck in a mouldy house all winter so I ended up in hospital 5 times with pneumonia and pleurisy, twice already so far this winter. Basically it's lung inflammation, usually from a respiratory infection, sometimes autoimmune diseases. Wouldn't surprise me since the vaccine gives you a dose of it if you already have poor health.","See I thought that could have been it, but breathing isn't really an issue for me. :/",0
"Curious about why youre stoked?","Um…my body has developed immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without me having to get the illness because I got the vaccine. Stoked! I’m going to assume good intent in your question and hope you are just being curious and not baiting me…",0
"JnJ seems to offer more protection vs variants. But if you're not a high risk demographic,  why bother?","I’m Canadian, it’s needed to engage in society. I’m currently unvaxxed as of now but I don’t know how much longer I can go on with this.",0
"Natural immunity is the only way out.","while it is probably helpful, it is not the only way out. vaccine induced immunity is also needed.Edit:jesus i love this subreddit, bunch of antivaxxers lmao",0

"Consult different doctors, heart problems a real thing,  only get vaccinated when you are 100% sure it won't effect your heart","The heart effects from the vaccine are mild and temporary.

"The chances of it killing a healthy person are less than .001%.","You are delusional. My nephew just died from Covid. Healthy, fit and unvaccinated. He was 20 years old.",0
"It’s incredibly rare for any vaccine to cause long term side effects. Almost all side effects show up within two weeks, when they do occur. What are the negative experiences you’re referring to?  I’m in Canada as well. I believe the NACI which is our vaccine committee, put a great document explaining mRNA vaccines any risks. A covid infection can be absolutely deadly for immune compromised and elderly people. A vaccine would drastically reduce your ability to spread covid to your loved ones. I’m fully vaccinated, as is most people in my life (family, coworkers, friends) I’d be happy to answer any questions. I did not hear any negative reactions from any of them, save for expected side effects.","""any vaccine"" polio, mumps vaccine etc that most people are used to as ""being rare to cause long term side effects"" are not experimental vaccines like this one. it doesn't even make sense to lump them in together. they are also not mrna vaccines. the inventor of mrna type vaccines himself says this vaccine is not safe. this vaccine hasn't even been out for 2 years, there's no way to claim it doesn't have long term side effects, that's just a lie. no one knows, not you, not me. even drugs that make it out of experimental trials and get approved, some of them get pulled as more long term effects are discovered down the line, eg. a stop smoking drug was recently pulled from market here bc it was linked to cancer. &amp;#x200B;cdc said today that vaccinated can carry more viral load that unvaccinated people and doesn't affect your ability to transmit virus at all. if you weight your risks and benefits (as a young person unless you have a serious illness you are probably at 0 risk) to getting the vaccine do it for yourself vs. ""to protect others"" since it seems the vaccine does not protect others and actually increases transmission of the virus.",0
"Why did you get boosted? Your demographic is literally one of the least effective by it.","More protection from infection especially with Omicron breakthroughs in people who got vaccinated earlier.",0
"Y'all need to look up the definition of a vaccine, this experimental mRNA modifying jab is no vaccine.. The CDC even states now on its website that it has a 75%-85% efficacy.. If it were a vaccine, that would be the worst vaccine in history","The flu shot has even less.",0
"Yes. In Israel rn most sick are vaccinated","Is that true, I really don't know anymore there's so much misinformation on vaccines being good and vaccines being bad.",0
"Assuming you get an active dose, it will make you sterile. Do not get this thing if you value your health.","Yeah? Then how come I know of someone who got pregnant after the covid vaccine? BS",0
"In my opinion, they will not try to eliminate the covid virus, they will replace the flu shot with it. Next thing you know is you have to take their vaccine/booster every year. Voila! Somebody makes a lot of money at other people's health expense. These are in my opinion only.","You realize that’s literally what we hope for right? The genetics for the Spanish Flu are still found in the seasonal flus that pass around every year. There isn’t an elimination or a magic cure. People who think that’s the case then go all nutso and antivaxx are the same exact people who know zip about how a virus works. They commonly don’t even seem to realize there are many different types. They sure do scream loud though.",0
"My wife’s booster hit her like a truck too. It was so bad she said she’s never getting another one and she’d rather have Covid. I was like uh, no.","Honestly, I had covid and it was way easier than my sisters reaction to the booster. Most cases are mild, obviously some are not. But most are.",0
"Covid vaccination creates inflammatory proteins - morning after pill is very high dose progesterone which can be inflammatory and clot producing. You do the math!","This person seems smart - i’d listen to permaban MD",0
"When will people learn that being vaxxed doesn’t mean you won’t get the virus. Just like before covid there was still the common cold and flu, stomach viruses/bugs all sorts, if you don’t wash your hands after going to the bathroom and before eating or being in close proximity to people that are ill, you’re going to get sick at some point. Not trying to be harsh and I hope you make a swift recovery. It’s just common sense.","It's ""common sense"" that vaccines don't actually protect you from catching the virus you were vaccinated against, c'mon guys, what are you thinking. lol.",0
"If the chest pain gets worse then see a doctor. Some young men are getting heart issues that require medical attention as a side effect of the mrna shots. Especially if you had a weird taste in your mouth after the shot. Seems to be a sign that they missed the muscle and injected you intravenously.","It's not a pain, more like an ache. And it's not constant, it's kind of random. And I do not have a metal taste.",0
"No issues you would be fine!","How do you know this? Did you do any scientific studies with enough data to conclude that? The vaccine is new and many problems can evolve in the future.

"It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. You can still spread the virus. Furthermore, with the new varient you are more at risk for complications having been vaccinated for the past strain. The vaccinated are spreading the virus more as they believe that they cannot catch nor spread the virus anymore and are not wearing masks or distancing any more.","It does matter if you are vaccinated.

Vaccinated people are much less likely to get covid and less likely to spread it.

If they do get a breakthrough infection, they are likely to recover faster and therefore are contagious for a shorter period of time.

They are also much less likely to get seriously ill. Very unlikely to get hospitalized or die. Which means they won't take up hospital resources.

It's the UN-vaccinated that are causing large outbreaks and spreading the virus more.",0
