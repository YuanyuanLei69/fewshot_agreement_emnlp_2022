"What symptoms were you feeling that prompted you to go to hospital?","Intense pain in me left shoulder worse than when I broke my collarbone when I tried to take a deep breath , a fever of 102 for about 3 days , and urine was extremely yellow , dehydrated more so than after drinking I would say were the main symptoms . Shoulder pain was deferred pain from the heart , but I was icing it 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off because it felt just like I had torn something inside there .",1
"Getting the J&amp;J vaccine in 1 hour.  Not Getting myself worked up as I am putting it in God's hands.  I feel the J&amp;J has less side effects than the others.  I am not for or against being vaxxed.  I do slightly feel pushed to get it but realize once it's fully approved  they will make it mandatory.  I will probably start my own post afterwards.","I just got my j&amp;j two hours ago! It wasn’t too bad, a little pain in the arm but so far i feel very relieved . I will update tonight",1
"So… just to double-check, you’re not actually in pain? You’re upset with the pharmacist because you think they did something wrong that could cause side effects?","I think it’s valid to be upset if you know for sure it was administered incorrectly.",1
"Sometimes pulsatile tinnitus combined with a headache is a symptom of intracranial pressure which is definitely something to rule out quickly. Is it worse when you lay down?","It was when worse lying in bed last night, particularly on my left side. It's not as bad this morning though. Are there symptoms I should look out for/monitor? Actually I just lied down for a couple minutes and the beating in my ear started to come back",1
"I had a bit of dizziness (chalked it up to nerves) and immediate tinnitus. I've had a several other issues following but, yes, I had immediate reaction to Pfizer dose 1. I hope you're feeling better and I hope the accute effects are your only.","Yeah I feel better and so far nothing else.",1
"Prospective mothers cannot base their choices on your experience alone, but it is good that you shared it.What is needed are large scale surveys on women who got vaccinated before and during pregnancy, but these don't seem to be very forthcoming from health authorities.","I’ve been giving data to a couple studies on pregnancy and breastfeeding so here’s hoping more info is available soon.",1
"No","Thanks for your answer!",1
"At least you got it.  I'm glad you are healthy, but that's no guarantee you're disease proof.  Quite a few healthy doctors and nurses at the beginning of the pandemic are dead now.  Guy's like you don't often go to the doctor for wellness visits, hope you are an exception.","Thanks for the support",1
"Yeah I had a few dizzy spells a few hours after the second vaccine whereas I didn’t have any side effects from the first. The armpit pain is probably your lymph nodes swelling","I had no reaction to the first shot but for my second I thought I just had a long day or something. I had my shot around 5pm chilled waiting for friends to get online and then was dizzy or a bit disoriented around like 7 or 8pm until 10:30ish pm so I mostly just voice chatted with my eyes closed rather than join in what everyone was doing. I felt perfectly fine after that which was a relief because of a birthday I was helping arrange for a friend the next day..",1
"I got J&amp;J on April 27. I have an appointment Monday to get a Moderna booster. I'm off Tuesday and I hope that gives me enough time to recover. Your post makes me feel better.I'm 33, male. The J&amp;J shot I had chills and slight headache overnight. Didn't get much sleep and felt sluggish all the next day. My arm was sore for a few days but by day 2 I was feeling back to normal.","How did your moderna booster shot go? I get my booster Wednesday and am having some serious anxiety about it. Roughly the same age and got JJ in March",1
"Sorry..hit post before I should have. Got both shots from Pfizer in May/June and had delayed reaction 6 days after shot 2. Extreme fatigue, body aches and then same 6 days after that. Then got the Pfizer booster Xmas eve and started having extreme nausea/body aches last night (day 4). Today I feel better but feel off.","I got my Pfizer booster on Dec 23 and didn’t start feeling any effects until Dec 26.  And then it was dizziness and swollen lymph nodes. Didn’t have as much of a delay with either of my first 2 doses (but those were AZ and Moderna).",1
"Edit: I went to the ER this morning. They gave me an epipen because my face was so swollen my throat started becoming tight. I also have a 5 days prescription of steroids. It itches like hell, and I’m kinda disfigured even tho it got better after a few pouches of Benadryl","Do you think you could have been exposed to something else? 9 days seems like a long time.",1
"Your probly just hyping yourself up. Sit and chill. Watch some tv or something.","Thanks. I’m trying this now and it seems better when I don’t focus on it or think about it. But the second I start thinking it could be something wrong like a stroke the symptoms come back.",1
"I just got my first moderna because of the mandate. No problems but I’m not looking forward to this 2nd dose. Most posts seem to have similar reactions.","My second dose of Moderna was a breeze, only felt tired and a very slightly sore arm. The first dose I had stronger symptoms all around. Make sure you stay well hydrated drink extra water and Gatorade and it should help",1
"Period cramps don't involve your ovaries at all. Go to the hospital asap, you could have a torsion.","Thanks",1
"I had nausea and diarrhea after the J&amp;J that lasted over a month","Oy - I hope it wont last this long!",1
"I got both shots of Pfizer, and my temp didn’t go past 99.7’ after the second shot.","May I ask how fast after the shot did you develop the fever and when did it go away?",1
"My understanding from what I was told in two weeks from yesterday after my second dose is fully effective I am 95% protected so there's still a possibility I can get covid and spread it BUT if I do contract it should be a very mild and manageable case nothing requiring hospitalization well that's my understanding and the more people fully vaccinated the less chance of us getting and spreading it due to this high percentage but I may be wrong there's alot of diff information out there","Does anyone know what the percentage of fatality is for unvaccinated individuals who get COVID that don’t have underlying health conditions nor are senior citizens. I would like to compare the percentages from vaccine related adverse effects in young and healthy vs hospitalizations from COVID in the young and healthy.",1
"Sounds like more like a rash rather than a scar. Yeah you can develop some localised skin reactions to the vaccine that looks like raised pin prick marks. It's generally just a limited immune reaction. Should go away in a few days.","Yes rash, I got the vaccine two weeks ago, just developed yesterday.",1
"Can anyone speak to this re: the booster? I had an insanely painful period after my second dose and I’m not looking forward to that happening again.","Still haven't had mine yet, definitely not looking forward to this",1
"Hey, no worries. Really. It's normal. Drink a lot of water, take some paracetamol and roll with it. You should be fine in a couple days. Congrats on getting vaccinated!Edit: alright, I'm out of this subreddit. Being downvoted for offering support and positivity just shows this is an antivax chamber for dumb, angry people.","Thanks! I took 1 nurofen, 2 aspirins (aspirin usually works the best for me) and the last one was a rubophen, I believe that one has paracetamol. I took it more than an hour ago, so far nothing... I really hope it gets better, I'm scared to sleep even if I could. I thought I would get away with it with minor symptoms haha, I was fine until like 6 hours in.Also, I am drinking a lot, I have drunk around 3.5 liters since the shot (EDIT: I'm constantly thirsty anyway).",1
"I ended up with a ridiculous amount of ectopic beats","Yeah I’m getting the same thing. Mostly in response to exercise. Stopped exercising for a month and a half and haven’t felt it since, started back at the gym yesterday and it hasn’t popped up again.",1
"Double vaxxed pfizer. (2 of 2)No side effects no problems except second dose felt a bit stronger for me while my SO felt she had it better on second dose than first one.Vaxxing because i mostly believe in science and where i come from we didn't had antivaxx bs as i grew, this to me seems very recent.","That’s really interesting, my boyfriend was the same as you guys, mostly fine, sore arm and felt a bit weird for a day or so. My first jab was the same as above, the second one I felt absolutely shite for a week afterwards. I had Pfizer too, despite the side effects I’d do it again if I had to.",1
"Im on the same boat. Got moderna as a booster on Saturday and oh boy, was not prepared for the pain on Sunday, today I'm extremely tired and my tummy hurts real bad. Hopefully tomorrow it will be better","I still feel a bit off, but I’m just grateful I don’t feel as awful as I did on Sat. Keep yourself hydrated. A heating pad was my best friend to help ease the aches a bit. Hope you feel better soon!",1
"I would say speak to a doctor. Most of your side effects are probably pretty typical but heart palpitations concern me. Your heart is nothing to play with. Maybe just get everything checked out and possibly ask for an extension at work to wait a few weeks. At least you could have it noted from a doctor that you had adverse effects and they may be willing to work with you.","Probably just a little touch of  myocarditis?",1
"First dose April 9 and second dose April 30. Take oral birth control for over a decade with super regular periods. Period was normal April and may. This month I’m having spotting 1.5 weeks before my period. Not usual for me. Since it’s so long after vaccine not sure if related but sort of concerned after hearing many women experiencing irregular periods.","What kind of vaccine did you get?",1
"I experienced this after my first Pfizer shot. Just got my second yesterday so we’ll see how that goes. But the hair grew back after the first one, although it took some time.","Thanks for sharing your experience. How much time did you have between the shots and did you experience any other skin related issues after the first shot?",1
"my sister couldn’t taste or smell for like 2 weeks, but this was December so the vaccine wasn’t available yet","oh that’s not too bad!",1
"I'd wait. My friend just recently got the vaccine and she's been trying to get pregnant and now she can't according to the doctor.

That's the second friend I've had it's been trying to get pregnant with her person that after the vaccine found out they could not have a kid.

Now not saying it's related to the vaccine but..... They both did find out they can't have kids after taking the vaccine. Js.

You're 25, you can make your own choices especially when it comes to deciding whether or not you want to be a part of phase three trials of these vaccines.","It jumpstarted my period and gave me rectal bleeding. Lol",1
"Could it possibly be a hydration or nutrition issue?","Hopefully not TMI but I thought it was at first and began absolutely drowning myself with all the water I can. No matter what my urine is always yellow with dry mouth where prior to the shot if I drank this much fluid I would be urinating clear fluid and often....",1
"So happy you’re doing better :) when did you get the first dose if you don’t mind me asking?","my first (and only) dose was june 11th, had bad numbness on one side of my face and body for about 10ish days then it went away and then it returned on june 28th. lasted with tingling/stomach flu like symptoms (i’m guessing i got sick and triggered the vaccine side effects again) until probably july 11th. i’ve been mostly ok since, tiny bit of numbness but not to the extent it was! slowly getting back to normal!",1
"I think anyone who would base a decision about their own safety and health on resentment about being told what to do, is emotionally a child, and has a lot of growing up to do, regardless of the number of times they’ve been around the sun. I don’t want to insult you, but how bullied or pressured you feel about it has no bearing on whether it’s a smart choice for YOU. If you end up with it, with complications or serious illness, or end up infecting someone vulnerable and killing them, do you think it will matter to you one bit that you stood up to the pressure and didn’t get vaccinated?

Real maturity and strength lies in making good choices and doing the best for yourself and people you care about, regardless of peer pressure either way.","I don't take this post as insulting, I know it may be emotionally immature, but I just don't want to be forced to. Kind of a, ""would you jump off a bridge if asked"" thought.

I do support what you've stated, I do, and have taken those things into consideration. Reading what others have said, and yours, I'm likely to get the vaccine. Being honest though it's mostly my school, switching universities and finding what will transfer and what offers a half decent education in comparison to my current school would be a bit more work than I'd like.",1
"Do you need 100% safe?","No such thing as 100% safe, but 90ish percent is better than 61% and waning immunity. Besides I have geriatric parents so covid will probably put them six feet under.",1
"Did/ do you have other pain besides chest pain? For instance, joint pain? Telling someone to take ibuprofen for chest pain is bad medical advice and in some cases can worsen the condition.","No joint pain. Just pain left side of my chest",1
"I just received my second dose yesterday. I woke up this morning around 4am with burning/tingly arms and hands. I’m scared.","My bf had those symptoms along with a host of others after his jab. It went away eventually.",1
"Yes i started my period early after my first dose and had much more cramping than usual. The endocrine layer in the uterus is part of the immune response, this is normal!I once had my period two weeks in one month, a week apart, after I had the flu. It happens","I see. My periods weren't regular before the shot, so it's definitely not a stretch to think that the vaccine caused a shift.Thank you, reading your experience has set my mind at ease.",1
"Vaccine. Only a nucleo capsid test would tell you if you had the virus even that would not be 100% accurate","Thank you for this information, this is what I've been trying to find!!",1
"Yes, I do regret it. Everyday.","Can you explain?",1
"My countrys vaccine guideline says 28 days","Germany is the same.",1
"I'm glad I didn't know about this risk before my vaccination. I have the MTHFR mutation, and had the first dose of Pfizer way back in January, and the second dose mid February.  I have had no issues. For the record: I am a 43yo/ female, with HBP.","Thank you so much for the reply!",1
"I have two friends who had shingles recently- one, after vaccination, the other, after getting Covid-19. Because shingles is dormant varicella zoster, any actual infection or immune response (getting all ramped up to FIGHT THE INVADERS! even if there are none) can trigger a shingles outbreak.Unfortunately those of us who had chickenpox when we were younger might face this later on down the line. At present though it's my understanding that if you get shingles at any point prior to the typical recommended date for Shingrix, you can get Shingrix with a prescription. Shingrix also has a pretty strong systemic response, similar to vaccines against covid.This is kinda in line with me getting a cold sore after I got vaccinated- but it also happens when I get sick or stressed. Stinking dormant viruses!Without a doubt, shingles is preferable to Covid-19, especially at her age. But she could have easily gotten it soon regardless. Nasty stuff.  ETA: there also might be a coincidence more generally- seems that shingles is on the rise because so many people are now vaccinated against chickenpox, so we're not exposed to is as often and small exposures tend to tamp it down over time. Weird.","This makes sense! Thanks! So it's not necessarily an adverse reaction to the vaccine, it could literally be a reaction to anything occupying the immune system more than usual.",1
"You could wait for the Novavax, but you are taking a risk, because unvaccinated (and not previously infected) ppl def get sicker if infected with delta variant. The novavax is supposed to come out this fall, is highly efficacious against the variants of concern and is associated with fewer side effects than any of the vaccinations currently in use.","I was excited reading about Novavax a few weeks ago. I like their more traditional approach vs. the RNA route.",1
"My daughter is still having issue 4 months after her second shot of Pfizer. She keeps getting her period, or just bleeding- not sure it’s a cycle or not- but it will stop and a few days later start again. It was very very heavy at first as well- I don’t think it’s as heavy but it’s not stopping. Doctor says, “keep an eye on it”","Awesome medical advice - ""Keep an eye on it""  lol",1
"I just had my first shot and my whole left arm is burning/tingly. I can barely lift anything with that hand. Shooting pain when I move it. I’m trying to keep it moving so it won’t stiffen but holy crap I am in pain. No other side effects, breathing is normal. Going to monitor and maybe call the local health unit if it doesn’t get better.","my left arm, the arm I DIDNT get the shot in has been significantly weaker. sorry to hear you had a bad experience as well...",1
"I experienced the same thing. It shouldn't last too long","Thank you. It's a relief knowing others have experienced it and that it resolved after some time.",1
"I’m trying to find a study they’re doing Thats suggesting that the spike protein of the vaccine does spread through the body and does accumulate in the ovaries.

"It’s definitely something you have to figure out on your own at this point unfortunately. I got the OK from my doctor and got a Pfizer (will be 2 doses) on top of J&amp;J. But definitely consider the options as well. I personally didn’t feel as though I could live through another case of COVID, but they say the 2nd time can be easier, I just didn’t want to deal with it so I got the Pfizer.","When did you get j&amp;j? And when will you get pfizer?",1
"Chest pain from strong anxiety is *way* more likely.Source: have generalized anxiety disorder, had chest pain from it before COVID was a thing.  ECG showed everything normal.  Anti-anxiety meds helped greatly.","I’ll look into it. Thank you for the response",1
"Thank you for sharing. Got my Dose 1 Pfizer April 1 and have been through hell tinnitus/hyperacusis, swollen optic nerve (causing a blind spot in one eye), irregular periods (Got it day of Vaccine April 1, then came a week late May 8, now still haven’t gotten it in June despite having all the symptoms), brain fog/dizziness, and last but not least the most crippling anxiety I have experienced in my life. This gives me hope maybe it will get better soon. Unfortunately my university is forcing me to be fully vaccinated before returning in the fall though.","They won't allow a medical exemption for you?

I had COVID last year after giving birth to my daughter and I want to do anything to keep us both protected. I live in a COVID hot spot area.","pp did you have to lie to get the pfizer? I assume i would have to say it's my first one but then I wonder if they have me on some kind of database.",1
"This happened to my good friend. A group of my friends all got it at the same time. He had the most mild symptoms and was better after about a week and a half. He said it just felt like he had an annoying cold.","Yeah, my friend also said it took a week and a half for him.",1
"Not yet.Resting heart rate of 100-130 some days. That's up from the 50-60 it was a year ago or so. If I go for a walk it goes up to 180.","180?? Isn’t that like super dangerous? gives me anxiety just reading that",1
"Did you ended up getting the j&amp;j? My immunologist told me the same thing to get j&amp;j as my second shot. My first shot was moderna and I have a bad reaction to this shot, that’s why the doc told me to get the j&amp;j, but I am a little bit hesitant because there is no data regarding mixing vaccines.","Yeah I did end up getting a J&amp;J dose, but it was kind of difficult. Neither my doctor nor my allergist had J&amp;J, so I had to look for somewhere else to get it, but nowhere would do it because of my history of allergic reaction, despite having a doctor's note. They would just say it was ""against company policy"".Eventually I decided to lie during the screening and say I haven't had an allergic reaction to a vaccine, but that I do know I'm allergic to PEG. They went ahead and gave me the vaccine and I was fine. I did have pretty bad flu like symptoms for about 24 hours, but after that, I felt totally normal.That was about a week ago, and I still haven't noticed any issues.",1

"To be clear, exactly what is your vaccine injury? Has it improved? What are doctors saying about your injury longterm?","Mine was neurological. I live in Canada so I’ve only just finished getting all my tests done here as the waitlists are pretty long. My neurologist said that it seems as if I have peripheral neuropathy based on some weakness she observed, but they haven’t diagnosed me with anything yet. In the past seven months, I’ve basically watched myself lose all the previous strength I once had in my legs. I’m only starting to get better now, but I was bedridden for around two months. I developed hearing problems on the most affected side of my body. My right leg is numb now, with much less feeling than the left. I never got that feeling back. There’s internal vibrations that almost feel like seizures and a lot of tingling/buzzing. It almost feels like electricity is shooting through me. There’s many more symptoms but those are the main ones. Long term? I have no idea. I think it might be permanent or take a few years to recover.",1
"2 months and still have tinnitus and disabling neuropathy from pfizer. No answers from doctors yet","I'm really sorry to hear this. I have tinnitus sometimes too and I know how bad it is.I hope this question doesn't come off the wrong way, but if you had to choose all over again, would you still have decided to get vaccinated?",1
"Sorry you are dealing with this. How old are you? I just got the j and j booster because I was scared of this. I also got j and j in April. Besides the high rate heart you noticed. What other symptoms did you notice that made you go to the doctor for your heart?","I'm 31 year old male and athletic. Basically all the symptoms was for my heart issue: high resting heart rate, chest pain, and chest fullness feeling. Lying in bed lowers my heart rate, but I gotta be in a good position; otherwise I get chest ache. Ibuprofen does help take the edge off.Definitely a good call sticking with JJ",1
"I itches terribly after my first Moderna. All over my body and scalp. Wanted to peel my skin off. I took one dose of Benadryl and that helped enormously. I later had a worse second to my second dose, so it could also be something neurological as that’s what happened with my second dose. See the doc, but you may get some relief from Benadryl.","Same here, I had to take Benadryl I felt like I had ants running all over me.",1

This time... about 24 hours later I am feeling very slight tenderness in my arm, a very slight malaise, and otherwise just hungry.

"I got the shot 25M (as did my brothers, 27M, 23M and 19M) We had no side effects other than some soreness. While I was worried about heart issues, its important to remember how rare they are.

"This is because the new delta variant is highly contagious and the vaccine protects you from hospitalization rather than contracting Covid","The vaccine protects from contracting covid, but not 100%.

"Don’t worry about the shitty comments. I’m struggling myself with side affects from the vaccine 5wks on so don’t think that your post is being discredited by everyone.

It’s likely just a nervous reaction, give it a week or so and see if it remains. Aside from that I wish you well","We know a lady went in got it on Friday an was dead on Saturday. That’s obviously not what happens to everyone. An of course we don’t know why or what happened for sure to her.",1
"I, too, am continuing to have nearly constant headaches, heart issues.  I often can hear my heart beat and my chest pounds fairly often.  Thought I was in the clear last week as things were slowly improving, but headaches have worsened over the past few days.This has been going on for 4 months.","Have you been to a doctor/specialist and gotten any type of verdict? What version of the vaccine did you get?",1
"It kills young healthy people too you know. I have a SIL who lost her smell/taste for 1 1/2 years now. Its kinda like Russian Roulette ...wanna play with 1 round in the chamber or 3!","No it doesn't, source?

The Vax is roulette, especially since it's a lifetime subscription. Every 6 months roll the dice on a new adverse event or allergic reaction.",1
"The motive behind the proposal to give survivors only 1 shot was to stretch the then small supply of shots as far as possible. At least where I live, they never followed through. The 4 of us who had covid in Dec. all got both shots.Get both. The person checking your card to verify your vaccine status someday when you, say, go to get on a plane, isn't going to listen to your explanation of getting vaccinated post infection and only needing one, even if that becomes a recognized thing. All they're going to care about is that there's only 1 dose on the card.","I’m not so much worried about the plane thing. I don’t even want to get the shot because it took me so long to get better from covid that I really don’t want to risk feeling like absolute shit again. Maybe I should wait for novavax?",1
"You’re an adult. If you don’t trust modern medicine, then don’t trust modern medicine.

I got my vaccine, I’m fine. All my friends and family got it, they’re fine.

You can listen to all these people saying they heard something on the internet or their elderly grandmother who smoked for 70+ years all of a sudden got COPD after getting the vaccine, but fact of the matter, you’re an adult. Make your own choice. The facts and data are there.","They have no problem making the choice, it’s the consequences that get them. All of a sudden they believe in modern medicine when a lung collapses. It’s ironic really.",1
"This is just my personal opinion but if you already definitely had covid, i don't see the point in getting vaccinated.","That's true to some extent. In my country if you had covid in last 3 months you don't need a jab but with more than 3 months it is advised to get the vaccine (also mandatory for traveling if you don't want your 1000th test).Honestly everyone who can get a vaccine should get it. The benefits of a vaccine surpasses the negatives by far. As for me personally I have a Pfizer. So has my gf and my family ranging from a 16 year old cousin to 83 years old grandma. No severe side effects. My dad had covid 8days after getting the first dose when the vaccine isn't fully developed. Even though he was sick for a month it was fairly weak covid considering he's 66years old and that was almost certainly thanks to the vaccine as he has some other health problems that are considered bad if you catch covid. Also he has no signs of long covid so that's a plus too.",1
"Congratulations, you're immune like me... I've done everything short of licking random doorknobs (which I'm strongly considering), and I've never had so much as a cold during the entirety of the COVID thing. I've been on 12 airplanes, didn't wear masks most of the time and nothing. I'm starting to wonder if there's something wrong with me. I'm fully uninterested in getting a vaccine of questionable efficacy (nobody can deny this) all while playing side effect roulette.","I’m dont necessarily think I’m immune but I was weird not catching it from my fiancé after sleeping right next to her every night.",1
"Me and my whole family had no side effects aside from the sore arm.","Nice! Which one did you all get?",1
"I don’t even know what you mean by “catch COVID from he vaccine”. The vaccine is a mRNA not a live virus.","FYI, not all Covid vaccines are mRNA.  Currently, three vaccines are being administered in the USA, two of which are mRNA.  There are more vaccines in the pipeline working towards approval.  People use the term ""the vaccine"", but the truth is there is no ""the vaccine"", there are multiple vaccines with different ingredients, different efficacies and different side effects.",1
"havent got the shot yet thinking about maybe just getting the 1st and skipping the 2nd lol i know that would prob be a waste but whatevers

i just plan on traveling the world sometime in the future ...and i wish that countries would ya know ease there rules and guidelines for going there

idk i just might risk it

im so confused its almost been 2 years and havent got covid yet im always out n about bars stores work strip clubs and havent got covid yet","I believe a lot of the unvaccinated and the vaccinated have already had covid. When they quote the large number of cases 80% are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Then viral loads decrease in the unvaccinated by antibodies. I respect your choice and everybody’s choice.",1
"Don't take J&J. It has been causing a lot of cases of Guillain Barre in my country.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Mine wasn't so serious as yours, but it has been 2 months the Pfizer vaccine has caused me Bell's Palsy and I honestly don't think I'll ever recovery. I'm having no improvement at all. My second dose is scheduled for next month and I'm deadly afraid. Unfortunatelly, I'm in the same place as you too. I'm FORCED to take it or I won't even be able to enter a restaurant or get a job anymore.","I’m praying for you! I am so sorry they are literally taking you personal freedom it’s so fucked up",1
"Got the Moderna booster yesterday late in the day, felt generally well but feel a little fatigued and weak now.No big deal, just feel like sleeping and none of the napping today seems like enough.Nothing to complain about really.","Yeah, I'm on hour 20 and noticing the sleepy, weak and  a bit dizzy when I stand feeling.  Staying in bed today!  EDIT: weaky isn't a word",1
"I have chest achiness and tightness after the first shot of pfizer, I am a young, low BMI male and my heart rate is at 70-80 (probably higher than usual, although I don't have a reference point). End of fifth day, it's not resolving. I would like to ask if you also feel pains from the SIDES of your chest, as in, below-the-armpit-but-still-at-the-chest-part-of-the-body-place. Wondering if our experiences are in any way similar.Hoping that you will get better. The lack of information yet the amount of people reporting these things is worrying.","I'm sorry to hear it's affected you. I haven't experienced the kind of pain you're describing. I did have a bit of pain on my breastplate, and a difficult to describe sensation in my chest, almost like a tingling. That's pretty much gone. Now it's just the fast heartbeat. Hopefully we both recover soon.",1
