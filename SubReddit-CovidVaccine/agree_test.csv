"I’m sorry. But I thought it was well known that vaccines aren’t 100% effective. SO many people are getting Covid after they’ve been vaccinated. It was risky behavior on your part, I wish people were more informed that vaccines aren’t 100% effective.","It is well known. He's just a dumbaas. It's also well known that J&amp;J is much less effective than pfizer and Moderna.",2
"My second dose of Pfizer knocked me for a loop. I was sick for 5 days. Felt like I had the flu. Arm was so sore I had to carry it with my other arm. But still thrilled I'm fully vaccinated!","I hope you’re feeling better !!! The effects are worth it to help stop the spread",2
"More people actually died in the phase 3 trial from all causes in the injected group than the placebo group from all causes prior to unblinding the study. There is no evidence it even improves health outcomes in anyway shape or form. Yet here we are with mandates.","Yes. I saw this. It’s right there in the trial documents but no one actually looks at the facts and info for themselves and just listen to the media and government.",2
"Nobody knows any long-term effects from this vaccine and it only protects from the original strain. I remember the anthrax vaccine from the military and it wasn’t until years later that the issues appeared.","Not just “issues”, I have friends with full blown MS who were wheelchair bound within 10 years of receiving the anthrax vaccine. The govt denies the link to this day, and the best the injured can hope for is a class action settlement of a few thousand $ each someday. Now with the Pfizer vaccine only 46% effective against Delta variant (below WHO’s 50% threshold), combined with the already high survival rates for COVID - the rewards do not justify the risks IMO.",2
"I’m getting mine (Pfizer) on Friday and I’m super nervous. There’s a thread a few back about 1.5k people commenting and yes I went through it all and only 5 people commented having flu like symptoms the rest were tired and had a headache which helped my anxiety a lot","Yeah thats good then, the only thing im worried about is the twitching and long term effects i seen people comment about. God i cant wait to get this over with already",2

"I got Guillain-Barré syndrome from the Pfizer vaccine as well as extreme insomnia. I’m 12 weeks out from my first and only dose. Everyone else in my family and extended family was fine after their doses. But adverse events do happen.","This is what I wish more people could acknowledge. The vaccine is harmless for most, but side effects do happen, and those who suffer from them should not be dismissed.

How has the GBS affected you? My friend's friend got the same, and is currently in a wheelchair several months out from his diagnosis.

I wish you a speedy recovery.",2
"The fact they admit myocarditis hits harder the younger you are is terrifying when they talk about vaxxing kids without parents consent.","Myocarditis always hits young people harder. ~~The group most affected by myocarditis is adolescent boys.~~ Adolescent boys are commonly affected by myocarditis.Edit: Restated to clarify that adolescents don't necessarily have the highest *mortality*.",2
"Do the research before injecting anything. Apparently they -CDC are starting to study the effects the vaccine has on women. Might be a sign?","Yessssss. I’m personally trying to keep my wife informed on these things. I wouldnt KEEP her from getting it but goddamn do I not want her to get it.",2
"Once the vaccine is in you can’t get it out again.","This is my concern. I don’t like the idea that once it’s in me, it’s in me s as me I can’t change that. It scares me. I know that sounds crazy right?",2
"It's difficult to respect an opinion that is different from your own.  Most people have a hard time with this so I'm not surprised that you feel your opinion is not respected.Would you respect my opinion if I told you that I thought your grandfather was a fool for resisting the occupation of his country?As far as coercion, we have all been coerced to come to the conclusions that we have.  We like to think that we have free will and we make all our decisions without being coerced but we're always being influenced and manipulated by our environments.  Your grandfather was coerced to resist, you have been coerced to refuse the vaccine and I have been coerced to accept it.","Oooft you really got me there to be honest mate. Touché.",2
"The main active ingredient found is **curcumin**. **Curcumin** is an inflammation blocker. It's as effective as **some anti-inflammatory drugs** without the **major side effects**.

I worked at a health food store for a few years and learned all the great benefits, a great supplement for sure!",2
"Did they aspirate the needle?","While people downvote this, it was atleast extremely important when it comes to the astra zeneca jab (not aspirating the needle was the reason people died of astra zeneca jab), and constantly more and more information is coming about the importance of aspirating the needle to ensure the vaccine goes into the muscle and not into the bloodstream.",2
"What they are saying is that as long as covid is allowed to circulate in the wild, the more chances of it mutating.....that's how we got Delta.The situation the U.S.  is worse than in other developed naitons. . Our  death rate over the past two weeks, adjusted for population, is more than twice as high as the UK,  more than 7x  as high as Canada, and 10x + as high as Germany.99-99% of hospitalized patients are unvaccinated.   (2 nurses in my complex can attest to that at my local hospitals, too. )Get vaccinated.  We could be through with this already.  Get vaccinated  Also:   Reading comprehension is an important skill.    Fool is not a science site, and they already have a repuation for being click bait.","Why would somebody down vote this.  Literally 100% facts",2
"No. These vaccine manufacturers hold zero accountability. You’re on your own.","Absolutely true and disgusting. I was vaxx injured many years ago and found this out the hard way.",2
"The surprising findings came as a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended against offering booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine to all Americans ages 16 and older. In a striking rebuke, 16 of 18 experts told the agency it had not mustered enough data to make a third shot the norm.In lengthy briefings to the panel, representatives from Pfizer pointed to clinical trial results involving 306 mostly healthy participants to argue that a booster ""restores"" the 95% vaccine effectiveness rate seen earlier in the pandemic.Company officials also touted evidence from Israel, which rolled out boosters after seeing a rise in hospitalizations among people who were fully vaccinated. Those hospitalizations dropped dramatically after third doses were given, Israeli scientists have said.But panel members made clear that despite Pfizer's aggressive stance, it had not gathered enough evidence that a third shot was safe for young people and for those at lesser risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19.","The odd thing with all 3 vaccines, J&amp;J, Moderna and Pfizer is based on the news they all seem to have caused a possible increase in heart problems in younger adults from 16 to 30 years old at a higher rate than older people.  J&amp;J added possible myocarditis and other heart problem side effects side effects to their fact sheet in April.  But it was not well publicized on June 25 when our FDA told Pfizer and Moderna to add the same possible heart issues to their fact sheets and increased the age range to 39.The heart issues do seem to effect more younger adults at a higher percentage based on age range, but in various studies from 30 to 45% of the people who experienced heart problems after taking the vaccines were over 40 years old.",2
"I live in australia, it’s the same here, vaccines are basically mandatory now, unvaccinated will not be allowed to go anywhere even can’t work. Only place allowed is supermarket and pharmacy","Horrible. When did we normalize this sort of authoritarian behavior from our governments? Do a lot of people in Australia support these sort of decisions?",2
"You're getting some good advice here about how to calm down. However, if you are really concerned, consult a doctor. Four weeks post vaccination is a long time to have this going on.This subreddit is just for opinions and suggestions, not actual medical advice.","Yes. I went to make a doctors appointment and everything within my area / insurance are all booked up for about 20-30 days!!",2
"Your worst fear is your 15 year old son contracting covid-19? There's been around 600,000 deaths in the USA linked to covid-19, of which 337 were 0-17 years  of age, this is without taking any other factors into consideration. I'd say your fear could be bordering on irrational.","Absolute madness and there's no bordering on irrational...this dude is far past that point.  I mean, he vaxxed his kid without custody and is hiding it from the custodial parent.  Drama queens out here acting like its the damn bubonic plague!",2
"These are harmless, they're swollen lymph nodes that return to normal normally quick. As a male, I had the same thing.","You're right. I saw my ob/gyn for my annual check up after being fully vaccinated with pfizer. I asked her about it and she said for up to 6 weeks after the vaccine you may experience swollen lymph nodes in the breast/armpit area. Its just your body's immune response. I luckily had no issues and have had no issues since my vaccines were done in March. Of course if you're concerned and your doctor sees an issue it should be checked.",2
"From what I’ve read your supposed to get working out activities to bay for the 14 days. Your body is taking that time to recover. From what I’ve seen people who jump back into working out tend to feel sick.","This. Your body is very busy in the two weeks after vaccination, not just when you have side effects. Take it easy!",2
"Most ppl testing positive now are vaccinated. This whole narrative of “plague of the unvaccinated” is a little flimsy","It's extremely flimsy and borderline insidious.",2
"Considering I’ve got multiple people in my orbit who did not get the vaccine because they already had varying degrees of covid last year…. And are now so incredibly sick with delta variant…. I’d get the vaccine. You don’t know how your body will respond to being reinfected.","Yes, and the best immunity is in those who have had COVID and then get the shot.As our hospitals and ICU’s are full again now.  Please get the vaccine.",2
"Not Covid related but I had a bat incident a bunch of years back where I woke to find a bat in my bedroom. I live in a disproportionately high rabies county and it was recommended I get rabies shots since the little guy flew away and couldn't be tested.My insurance tried denying me coverage for the rabies series (which is INSANELY expensive) but good guy CDC and the Dept of Health fought tooth and nail for me to be covered. Solid folks over there.","Insurance are such scumbags. They essentially control healthcare instead of Dr's.",2
"It could be anxiety! I’ve had myocarditis and pericarditis and after my results have returned to normal I still get pains all the time. The problem is your mind may be hypersensitive to anything in that area. Anxiety may be psychological but it creates very real and physical symptoms","I second this. Last year I was going through a rough time and remember the stress caused me to breath in a way that caused chest pain. If the results are coming back fine you should be good. It prob just your muscles. Mine went away.",2
"Just got the Moderna booster yesterday after getting the Pfizer for my previous vaccinations. Dear lord it is horrible. Lymph nodes in my left arm were on fire yesterday, the day after the shot.  Makes it really hard to do anything even sleep. I’ve had Kidney stones that hurt less frankly. Don’t get me wrong, the booster is still important and I’d do it again, but they really need to provide context for what to expect given the high rate of people that had it happen slightly after the second shot like myself, because going into the third shot it is no joke.","Thanks for sharing! Glad to know I’m not alone. It is a next level pain, very unexpected. But yeah, I’d still get boosters again and again to protect myself and others if needed, just would be njce to know something like this, and the potential severity of it,  is possible.",2
"sorry for what's happening to you! I had my first shot in my right arm. Thinking back then that it wasn't related, I got a bad ache in the bones it felt like in my right shoulder.  Got my second shot in my left arm and then had bad pain in the bones of my left shoulder. Yes, I had the pain at the injection site but that went away after a few days. This pain was deep down. I remember thinking one day ""huh both of my shoulders are killing me, wonder what I did"" thinking I overdid it with some physical exertion. But no, this is seven months later and my shoulders hurt daily, sometimes I can barely move my arms.  After much searching online past injection site pain and it's safe it's safe, I finally got to an article on SIRVA. Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. Searching for a doctor now who is familiar with that. You might tell your symptoms to a doctor at the NAPA Medical Research Foundation and ask about the TENEX procedure. Although yours is not shoulder, they may be able to suggest something.Good luck!","Sorry to hear of your ongoing frustrating pain too - that sounds maddening!   I hope you are able to find some answers soon.  Thanks for the tips - will definitely look into that.",2
"I'm sure that when they turn on 5G towers, they will all call you to get better 5G reception on their iPhone for posting their conspiracy theory videos on TikTok thanks to the chip you got injected.","Lol right!!! Crazy ideas people come up with!! I have one political, one 5G, one biblical and even my younger sister thinks we will mutate lol",2
"But isn't it possible that the vaccine or some ingredient in it could cause the anxiety reaction? I read many VAERS reports of people who were vaccinated early, on 12/16/20. All were health care workers at that time. They reported a wide variety of reactions including rapid heartbeat. (But they used clinical terms, like tachycardia.)Most seemed to recover fairly quickly. But some said that they were escorted down to the ER at the hospital at which they were employed, for observation or treatment. Others were driven home by colleagues. Why would they have anxiety at the idea of the shot? They were eager to take it, were relieved at the thought of finally protecting themselves. Hmm.","I dont see why people who want the vaccine and choose to get it would then have panic attacks. Not like it was forced on them.",2
"Covid will do more damage on average","i love these antvaxxers that are downvoting posts like this. you lovely people do realize, you have A MUCH HIGHER CHANCE of worse outcomes with covid than you do with the vaccine.and don't argue ""well, the vaccines only been out x amount of time, there no way we know the long term effects"" bc most of the people that gotten their shots are completely fine and healthy , and it becomes increasing unlikely for those same people to develop ANYTHING due to the vaccine a year, 2 year or 3 years, or even 4 years down the road.so yeah, Zanthous is correct. the short and long term effects of covid is more riskier than the vaccine. which time will prove.i will probably get downvoted by the same ""lovely"" people, but that is okay(:",2
"I'd wait. My friend just recently got the vaccine and she's been trying to get pregnant and now she can't according to the doctor.

That's the second friend I've had it's been trying to get pregnant with her person that after the vaccine found out they could not have a kid.

Now not saying it's related to the vaccine but..... They both did find out they can't have kids after taking the vaccine. Js.

You're 25, you can make your own choices especially when it comes to deciding whether or not you want to be a part of phase three trials of these vaccines.","there are also many women that are having miscarriages and stillbirths.. they have no idea what the vaccine effects are or will be",2

"Feel free to check out my post. I have heart palpitations and anxiety and i was absolutely terrified of the vaccine but I finally got it. It ended up being uneventful and nothing like I imagined.","So things turned out pretty okay for you? That is good to hear. I'm thinking about getting the Pfizer one I read in some of your posts you got the moderna right? My girlfriend also got the moderna. I guess I'm worried because I'm a man in the age range to develop heart complications from the vaccine, which apparently is more common in men. Also, of course the horror stories of the handful of people who dropped dead the day after or the day of their vaccine. Obviously those are very few and far between, but certainly does worry me. It is nice to hear stories of positive outcomes though.",2
"The first study refuted itself While these results showed statistically significant increases in all sperm parameters, the magnitude of change is within normal individual variation and may be influenced by regression to the mean.","Yes!!! You just proved my original point!!! That the small data pool of 45 didn't have DECREASED sperm counts, but instead showed normal to INCREASED which would not agree with the vaccine having a long term (if any) effect on sperm fertility in those who participated. I simply quoted the other source as a baseline for anyone who didn't know what is normally encountered",2
"I say do your own research first and make a decision based on your own conclusions. Don't let anyone else dictate your choice.","I definitely will, that's an important point. But may I still ask for your individual opinion?",2
"Didn't for me. I had none to the booster but couldn't get out of bed all day after dose 2 (pfizer). You can't predict it.","I guess any person can have different reactions…",2
"I won’t be getting one, let alone my second shot. I’ve had shooting, stabbing, dull and sharp chest pain; a stabbing pain in my back and heart pain after my first. My left arm will hurt out of no where. I thought I was doing the right thing getting vaccinated but I truly regret it as I’m not exactly sure what it has done to me. I’m a 30 year old mom and healthy. I regret it deeply.","I had the exact same symptoms after the JJ, which I got 3 months after having had COVID. Never again",2
"why are we forced to be guessing about all this?   why wont the CDC who is ordering all these jabs talk about what to watch out for with side effects from the vaccines?   and why wont they make treatment suggestions?   doctors arent even generally aware of all this.","I lost faith in our CDC last February 5, 2020 when Director Redfield lied to us and down played mask.   He later said he lied because they did not want a run on mask because front line health care workers would need them.  It seems under our last President's administration the CDC and HHS were told to down play the oncoming pandemic, and the new administration is down playing possible side effects to get more people vaccinated?",2
"Reach. Sounds scary. I won't be getting my first one.","Same!",2
"Drink electrolytes if you haven't been.","Drink Brawndo, the thirst mutilator. It has electrolytes.",2
"This is something I'd like some honest details on. It seems that every week Natural Immunity vs Vaccine Immunity flip flops, but I've never seen a post regarding the antibodies created.","I know a few people who refused to get vaccinated partially because they are anti-vax but also because they or someone close to them had covid and they feel the antibodies they have are enough. It would be nice to know some real details on this.",2
"This is exactly the reason why I won't be getting the shot, likely ever.Everyone who took the vaccine before June/July thought they were taking the shot to be immune, and then the CDC came in and said ""welllll, it's actually not 100% effective, it just makes getting covid less bad.Why would I take something with unknown long-term effects that has been proven to not even do what it's supposed to do - stop you from getting and spreading covid?So people want me to take this shot purely to make covid ""less bad"" if I get it, when I am young and healthy with no co-morbidities? No thanks, I'll pass.","Lol what was funny was the CDC calling it “very rare” breakthrough cases. Then they said if you are one of the rare ones who get it, you’ll most likely feel nothing. I remember when they changed the definition of 95% efficacy. It used to mean that if you were exposed to 100 positive people, only 5 of those would get through to you. Then now they say oh its 95% effective against severe hospitalization/death. Tired of all the fucking lies.Im in my 20s and was healthy and covid kicked my ass pretty good even though i was fully vaxxed. My case was “mild” according to CDC definitions but the virus is just relentless and doesn’t let off. I don’t know whether i’ll get the booster because im worried about vaccine side effects after having covid. I wish they would just come up with a drug or nasal spray that completely prevents you from catching covid rather than making us inject these stupid fucking vaccines every 6 months.",2
"So if I had the virus *and* the vaccine and am about to get the booster (Moderna, I work in healthcare) I should be like. *invincible*!?  /s","Yep, you will be able to leap over buildings with a single bound and with moderna you also have the power of magnetism - metal objects, not women - there is no drug for the latter.",2
"A lot of people don't have a signature on their card. Many people don't even have the name of the place where they got it. You need to make sure that your vaccine information is in your State's immunization database. That is your backup and is more legitimate than the card, which people are buying from scammers.","thank you for providing real information in response to this i appreciate it",2
"Similar age to you except I'm a male. I had long covid in 2019 before it was recognized (business travel to china) and had the same side effects. Panic attacks, heart issues, word recall, tinnitus, chest pains, trouble swallowing, etc. The anxiety component fucked my life up for a solid 2 months after the symptoms showed. At the time, 12/2019, I went to the doctor, got told anxiety happens and to exercise more. I thought it was a joke at the time because I'm a combat veteran and it was totally ridiculous. It's been almost 2 years and 95% of it has gone away. But I get the occasional flare ups of swallowing issues, tinnitus, and heart arrhythmia. Personally, while I never tested for COVID, I did have the antibodies.","The doctor who I met with prior to the second shot told me I believe in you and it would make sense because people have been developing anxiety after having covid..it’s absolutely crazy",2
"Thanks for sharing your perspective. No I was not on any medication by the time I got the vaccine, nor did I ever have any problems with my hair. After my experience I can only warn you about the Pfizer vaccine. I was a normal person until I got that vaccine and there was no indication that I would suffer such outcome. If what happened to me over the past couple of weeks were to happen to a teenager that might cause severe mental health problems. So in the interest of your daughter think twice before you vaccinate her with Pfizer. The added problem is that health care professionals take the position that there is no evidence that my condition was caused by the vaccine. They claim this is very common and I likely would have developed it even without the vaccine. However timing is very suspicious. I feel pretty much left alone with the issue.","I’m right there with you! Our timelines with Pfizer are identical. I was battling with women in a TE group on Facebook bc they kept saying no way could it be the vaccine! Until MANY other people started commenting they also believe the vaccine caused their hair loss! Even just a couple of weeks after the first shot! Like me. You are not alone. Some people just don’t want this to be out in the public in fear others won’t want to get vaccinated but people have a right to know the side effects and I’m pro vaccine myself!",2
"Funny that you came to that conclusion cause it also could mean that those who have been double vaccinated are more susceptible to catching a virus or perhaps even less able to fight off a virus. Those are legit possibilities too.","You are right. Honestly, being vaccinated I was really scared.",2
"Testing is vital to getting an accurate picture of whats going on.","I completely agree! Thanks for adding to this discussion.",2
"This does not sound related to the vaccine.","I agree, I haven’t heard anything like this. Doesn’t mean it’s not related but haven’t heard it anywhere",2
"If you are young and fit, catching covid is unlikely to make you more ill than a cold. Afterwards you will have real, natural immunity.","I'm double vaxxed and in late 20s tend to agree if vaxxed already",2
"You should go with any of the vaccines. With regards to the myocarditis, the odds of you developing myocarditis from COVID itself are *much, much* higher than from a COVID vaccine","To put this into perspective, myocarditis affects about 4x as many from covid then from the vaccine",2
"It’s so tough because a lot of people are on here because they had some weird side effects. But most people feel fine or just tired/sore after both shots. Glad you got vaccinated! Congratulations!","Thankyou so much! And yeah it is, everyone is different and bodies react differently and i dont mean at all to discredit them you know what i mean, its just scary to put so many things into your head after reading stuff hahaha",2
"I'm also regretting mixing doses, I didn't want to do it at first, but Manitoba's goals were very aggressive. My trust in this government is at an all time low..","I could have waited three more weeks to get Pfizer but it is what is it! I think they will start to accept this new trend. Not every country use the same Covid vaccine so hopefully the policy can change so everyone who are fully vaccinated (same or mixed) can travel",2

"I'm here to remind you that in the article it states 12.6 individuals per 1 million people from both Pfizer and Moderna combined. That's still incredibly rare. Even with the unreported cases, that's less than 1%.Every vaccine we have taken as kids (or adults) had a chance at a severe adverse reaction. ""But why are there so many posts in here about this exact thing?"" Because some people lie, some people actually had this happen to them, and for the others it's just anxiety or other health problems they're dealing with. If you never had anxiety you may not understand, but I had a headache last 5 months, had heart palpitations, feeling like I was dying: all anxiety I learned.Anyways, this shouldn't scare you.","Thank you. I am personally scared of GBS and heart inflammation because I have health anxiety. But I also know for a fact that the kind of symptoms anxiety and stress can cause, especially in the long term, are extremely limiting and scary. I've been to the ER so many times for crushing heart pain, I've been in a MRI machine more than I'd want to for things like headaches, face numbness, tingling, fainting and all had bening explanations and miracilously disappeared when I lowered my stress levels.",2
"Maybe it's just me being paranoid, but I feel there are SOME threads (far from all) that are created for the sole purpose of encouraging anti-vaccine discussions. Common traits tend to be users that bring up an obscure or potentially frightening symptom that they didn't necessarily experience themselves, but still want to know if anyone has experienced something along those lines. I completely sympathize with anyone that doesn't want to share their medical history, but some threads come off as a ""fishing expedition"".Oh, and all those polls...","They definitely follow patterns and don't look for opposition research to their own ideas.",2

"I really don’t understand the civil duty argument. If anyone has a good reason why it’s our civil duty to get this vaccination, I’m open to hearing it. I haven’t heard a good argument yet. The only one that comes close is, “so we don’t overrun the hospital system”, but this applied more to the old, obese, and those with comorbidities.","I was under the impression that I wouldn't spread the virus the first time I was vaccinated, I did it so that I wouldn't land others in an ICU bed. But now that it's evidently clear that isn't the case, I'm not going to play ball anymore.",2
"So glad I'm unvaccinated after all I'm seeing. Just saying.","Me too. This is a war against young people.",2
"I had heart rate of 120 and a 102 fever after 2nd dose. It lasted for a day and then was gone.  I also know a few people that were not vaccinated who had multiple covid tests come back negative before one came back positive. It seems the false negative rate on covid tests is pretty high so it's possible (maybe even likely) that you got infected around the time you got the shot (maybe a healthcare worker was contagious).","Agreed this is happening to people I know India the healthcare workers don't seem to be wearing enough PPE and there is zero distancing at the vaccination centres so very often people are contracting actual covid and not just suffering side effects. False negatives rampant because delta often doesn't show up in the standard test especially around May, June in India. Hope you feel better soon",2
"I am a 25yo female and I was stressed and anxious for a very long time about this. I come from a family that is very against rushing to get this vaccine and I never thought I would ever go get it but I did. If I can give you any advice it would be to wait until you are at peace with your decision and then go get it. Both my husband (29 yo male) and I had almost no side effects, I felt tired, had a slightly sore arm and had a minor headache. We both very rarely get sick as it is and have good immune systems. I will add that we are going for our second one in a few weeks. I feel some relief now that we have gone forward with getting the first one though.","This is relatable for me. My family havent got the vaccine, my mother is super against it and when i told her that im getting it this coming monday she went on a 'be careful with that shit, you dont know what they put in your body bla bla bla' which really nerves me. I hope i dont get many side effect and will feel relieved aswell after",2

"I think more people are getting boosted because of Christmas and Omicron, but I know that they have to use all the injections out of one vial on the same day. So, if you asked to be put on a wait list at a small neighborhood pharmacy I don't see the harm.They do seem to check vaccine date. I got boosted late at month 8.

"I had mine a month apart but many people in Canada had our doses pushed up to 3/4 months in between. There is no difference in side effects. You really need the second shot for the first one to do much, though. One shot is not effective against delta which is the main strain going around. Get the 2nd one ASAP","That's good Intel, thanks. I was planning on getting it soon because of delta so I'm not too upset that I have to for work.",2
"Making family members test before getting together with you is asinine. I would disown you.","Agreed, if people think their totally healthy family member is a threat to them why bother getting together for dinner. This isn't a healthy relationship.",2
"Sounds like a good strong response from your immune system and now you're good for 10 weeks, according to the latest guess from the CDC...silver linings?","I mean, it seems I’m protected from severe disease a bit longer than that but I’m definitely curious about what the research will show as we move forward with different variants.",2
"Yikes. This non-peer-reviewed study of 10 people looks only at antibody response, not T-cell immunity, which has repeatedly been shown to be J&amp;J’s strong point — particularly with variants. J&amp;J is shooting themselves in the foot by not releasing real world efficacy numbers, which I suspect will look good for them.","There really isn’t enough real world efficacy data to go around. Really moderna is in a similar boat. Moderna is largely assumed to be similar to Pfizer.J&amp;J probably works against delta quite well. This test would suggest it’s bad against beta when it’s one of the better according to the phase 3. There is more at play than lab conducted antibody tests.",2
"Just wanted to add that the covid vax most likely didn't save you a trip to the hospital. My whole family, including myself got covid and no one ended up in the hospital. If you're average health and age, you're likely to recover normally from Covid. People think Covid automatically equals hospital trip, and that's not always true.","Right, I know a lot of people, including myself, who have Covid while unvaccinated. Nobody ended up in the hospital. One was even a 70 year old man who has had a previous heart attack. Hospitalization happens, but it’s not common whatsoever.",2
"I'm right there with you.  No side effects from first two shots earlier this year, decided to get booster on 12/10.  Arm was sore for first few days, then on day 7 after booster, felt like shit.  For next 5 days had migraine headaches, fatigue, sore neck, and the worst, dizziness all day.  Now, 13 days after shot, only symptom left is more light-headed than dizzy, and still somewhat fatigued.  Totally unexpected for sure!","I've had this since my first vaccine in June. Its subsided a bit recently, but still affects me. Hope yours doesn't last as long!",2
"I’ve had the exact same issue. My periods have been really late for the last three months since being vaccinated. I tried to start a post on here, but looks like they’ve side lined it as it’s not appearing Thinking about maybe starting my own subreddit just so we can all record our own experiences for posterity sakeEdit: just started a community- r/fertilityandthejab. I’m tired of these male-dominated scientific communities which give no consideration to women’s bodies.","Not a bad idea, I’ve been getting a lot of replies to my email but when I open the app they’ve been deleted. Tsk tsk",2
"Wait the article says he tested negative...how is this a “COVID death?”","Yeah, just another confusing thing. None of it makes any sense really. My only guess is that he tested negative before his flight maybe...? So either the test results are wrong, he got it after the test...or there's a lot of bs going around.",2
"Contact Pfizer directly, they set up a multi billion fund to help with any adverse effects of this experimental drug. Oh wait.. they didn’t and are free of any liability. To even consider getting another shot shows how brainwashed people have become. Anyone should inform themselves BEFORE they take part in a trial study or what are the real risks they’re thinking of protecting themselves against.","weird how that works huh? Look up how much they spend lobbying the government.",2
"I’d say there’s little point. It’s very unlikely to give you much extra protection and on top of that it could go to people who really need a 1st or 2nd dose","Makes a lot of sense",2
"I am 28y never got covid either and feeling the same as you. I wanted to get the vaccine back in February when I was not eligible. Now that I am, and also kind of pushed by the government and public opinion in order to do so, I am not convinced anymore. I thought the vaccines would have stopped the infection, it seems is not. Also, it weirdly seems that vaccines are causing issues in a lot of young guys like me while they caused less issues to older people. I am kind of a bitch on getting sick in general, and I am very scared of getting covid. I am also very scared on getting a vaccine and potentially get sick as well because of that. I am waiting time to pass and I would like to see more studies around the impact of vaccines in young people. I also would like to understand whether I will need to get vaccinated once a year. The risk of covid on young people should be limited, the fact vaccinated people also spread the virus makes me feel less guilty also. I really would love to get a vaccine which will ultimately kill the virus but this is clearly not the case. And risk reward ratio for my age seems too unbalanced atm. You are not alone!","Well said. This is how I feel.",2
"In the US, there were a fair number of athletes who got myocarditis from Covid in their 20s. So, I think it is unlikely the vaccine has a higher risk than remaining unvaccinated.","Yes it's an apples to oranges comparison OP is making. Should look at instances of myocarditis with the vaccine (with no previous covid) vs. with covid.",2
"Does anyone how what is typical cost of heart screening for myocarditis in US?","This is key. Why aren't followup for vaccine related issues covered? ..oh yeah they have a liability waiver. Everyone could drop dead in 18 months and no pharma can gets sued.",2
"I hear you my parents have been antivax for a long time. And I have their only grandchild. We don't talk to them and haven't since last May.They tried to convince my husband to watch conspiracy videos and told him not to tell me. We have a healthy marriage so of course he did. The thing that matters is you have to live with whatever decisions you make regarding yourself and your kids. They don't. For our sanity it is highly likely we will mever see my parents again.The conspiracy is all they talk about. There is nothing else. It is not worth any of our mental health to keep them around. No matter how they're related to me. Does it hurt? Yes, yes it does. But if all they have to talk about is their latest conspiracy, there's no point in continuing to talk to them. While I'm just a stranger on the Internet, know you are not alone. A lot of people are going through this.","I’m so sorry for you. Heartbreaking to have to lose your parents. I’m moving 2700 miles to be closer to my family members because my county is insanely antiVax.",2
"If you are this bad at finding the papers, why do you think you will be able to interpret them better than the CDC interpretations?","You’re getting downvoted, but I think you’re spot on. Finding and being able to sift through information is an essential step of “doing your own research”.",2
"I've seen people here on reddit post how they got infected after having had covid previously and gotten both vaccines.

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again. The reason I think this is because immunity from prior infection is proving to be much better than immunity from the vaccines. And when you take the vaccines, you override your prior immunity with the immunity provided by vaccination. Just a theory, but I think that will end up being true.","Great points. Agree.",2
"Mmm, this is classic generalised anxiety with occasional panic attacks.Panic attacks are triggered by extremely stressful situations aka a pandemic or in your case the vaccine. Plus, if you have additional stress in your personal life it can make it worse. Imagine never having had a panic attack ever and suddenly getting one while cooking or shopping? Would you blame the supermarket for it or the food?Panic attacks come from your subconscious mind and something deep within it has triggered them.I hope you will feel better because I know how difficult they are.","This makes so much sense to me. I have to say anxiety and panic was the worst part of my vaccine experience. I felt very emotional after getting it because I know the brain fog and anxiety sucks. I’m at a loss… I don’t want to honestly get the booster shot. It’s like where does it all end? It’s too much. Getting Covid is too much, but the ptsd I have from the vaccine anxiety is a lot. Plus I haven’t been sick in 15 years. I’m extremely healthy so my system when haywire with the vaccine. Triggered the anxiety",2
"Lol it's fine. It's going to end the pandemic. This is more or less how it had to happen. All will get hybrid immunity and that will slow this down a lot","I love this idea that this strain will just go ahead and get everyone so we can move on. If it outcompetes others it will be sweet.  WE can go back to cancer and Overdose pervention.",2
"I got J&amp;J in April and got a Pfizer shot last week. Have two unvaccinated kids at home and not taking my chances. Feel great about my decision.","Same, but mine was in March. Doc recommended I get the second Pfizer shot to have 3 in total. Now, that might be different for everyone, but I don't regret the Pfizer shot at all.",2
"Dont risk your babies health.","Right, get vaccinated.",2
"Well you have to keep in mind that if someone doesn't have a reaction at all, it's unlikely they'll come to this subreddit and talk about it. So that's why you see nothing but negative experiences. Also, keep in mind that due to the high velocity of people getting vaccinated and no longer using this subreddit, there's been a high influx of anti-vaxxers so likely chances a lot of the posts are fake.","Honestly that's part of the reason I've been trying to answer people's questions here. The vaccine is safe, and I truly want more people to get it so states don't shut down again.",2
"You probably could but I’m not sure it’s necessary. Get a Moderna and for a trifecta if your doc says it’s fine.","Kinda like a speedball +1!  Me likey!",2
"No. That’s a really dangerous thing they’re trying to spread and make it real by repetition. The BEST vaccines are like 34% Effective. And don’t protect you from getting it it only lessens the symptoms. Makes it more likely to be a carrier and pass it. Tbh I never stopped masking &amp; sanitizing practices. Because why stop what is working??","This is all so new and scary in general. But I agree, not sure this will ever end because no one believes how serious this is or believe COVID is a hoax when it’s clearly not.",2
"Yes, there is a massive push for vaccinations which is crazy. Unvaccinated people are not the drivers, and mostly it is younger cohort which is recovering well ( hence why we see huge COVID numbers in UK but low deaths and hospitalizations Dec 20 vs June 21 - same COVID numbers but low death rate). Initially they\* said we'd need 70% vaccinated, then 80% and now they're saying 90% for herd immunity. Next step is 100% vaccination for immunity. It just doesn't make any sense anymore.","Global clinical trials to see if it actually works. Amirite?",2
"I guess you could tell them that the Delta variant will also change their DNA and cause cancer 10 years from now. And ED. Throw ED into the fable for added effect if the right audience.","You could say *life* causes cancer.",2
"I'd say microchip conspiracy bs believe only very small subset of people and msm being msm concentrates mostly on them because it generates clicks. most people are concerned about rushed development without any long term human trials and vaccine mandates.","There was a survey circulating a few months ago that confirmed exactly this. The microchip stuff is almost uniformly viewed as nonsense, even amongst those who are vaccine hesitant. But it gets views and clicks!",2
"If you are still on the Vax wagon might as well collect them all. Otherwise don't boost your risk of injection injury, consider yourself lucky the first two didn't harm you","totally agree.",2
"I have for 5 weeks but mostly due to awful stomach and intestine issues. All started 3 days after pfizer first shot. Same results with doctors as everyone else. Everything fuckin normal and can't find any issue. Dismissive when I suggest it's from the vaccine. Went to ER twice and got scoped. Fuckin nothing.","This is definitely a thing, informally dubbed ""Pfizerrhea"", but it's too difficult for them to track who it is affecting and why. I had the same thing - but we're edge cases, probably 1 in 100,000 people getting this effect.I've found a couple of others on this sub who have had it too. My guts were ruined for 1 week after the first vaccine, that was 3 weeks ago now and it's mostly better but it's still just a tiny bit unstable and inflamed.Our immune system is TIGHTLY entwined with our gut microbiome and the densely packed nerve system in our guts. It adds up that a big immune response could kick off an adverse reaction down there.",2
"You could have dysautonomia which can occur with mast cell activation. Spike protein activates mast cells.","Yes. This is what I believe has happened to me. I have POTs I’m sure of it. I have a cardiologist appt coming up to confirm. Also broke out in a night time rash on my legs since the vax and I have burning skin all over even though nothing is visibly wrong with it other than the bier spots form the circulation issues.

Do you have any more info on mast cell activation and the spike protein?

Does anyone know of any support groups for covid vax victims? I can find anything because it’s all censored it seems",2
"Getting rashes and potentially dying just means it's working. What are you, some kind of anti-vaxxer?","lol this sub has completely turned into an antivax forum, I love it. I wonder how long before Ghislaine Maxwell shuts it though…",2
"My mom has developed Myocarditis since getting the vaccine and nobody will even acknowledge that it causes it. This whole situation is so insane, I swear. Yes, COVID could cause it but tons of people have barely any symptoms. The vaccine can cause it but we are being forced to get it by our employer or shamed if we don’t. It seemed like a no brainer to get the vaccine to me and my family UNTIL my mom started having heart and blood pressure problems after taking it. When it happens to you, it’s a whole different situation. Which do you choose? And why will doctors not acknowledge side effects and say that’s not what caused it? That’s seems a bit shady to me.","I completely agree with you. If my husband is forced to get the shot and he dies from a blood clot, who is at fault? You can’t sue the pharmaceutical companies. The cardiologist does not want to be liable for anything and won’t put his name on paper. Meanwhile he could lose his job over it. Getting the vaccine is not a one size fits all approach. This shaming for not getting the vaccine needs to stop.",2
"I'm not Getting it. I am not concerned about Covid. Never have been.","I'm not either I just want to keep my job lol. guess I'll be paying for a covid test twice a week",2
"My ER visit cost me 600$ tho.  :(","Just sue pfizer or moderna for the side eff.... oh wait",2
"Corona Realism claims that the least vaccinated places are having the least cases now (based on the first graph). Except the first graph is about the delta variant, literally says so in fine print under the graph: Source John Hopkins Covid 19 Delta. Its showing places where the delta variant is surging, not where COVID as a whole is surging. Conclusion: Corona Realism doesn't know how to read graphs.","I'm confused. You'd think covid or varient, least vaccinated places showing to have least number of cases should make you go hm",2
