"So I personally know a few anti-maskers pretty well - we went to college together, and we are still connected on Bookface etc. And I see how they purposely go out to stores, phone in hand, no mask in sight, basically asking for a fight. This one girl posts a new video every day. And her cohort of anti-maskers cheer her on and tell her she’s being a modern-day Joan of Arc.

I think the best method with these kind of people is to just keep your distance and ignore them. They thrive on the negative attention - it’s the only kind of attention that they get in their sad, sad lives. And they WILL post a video of you and call you a Karen - it’s literally the footage they have entered the store to get.

EDIT: I saw you are worried about your unvaccinated child - great point. So one thing about these types of people is they claim to really care about “the children”. I would ask them to please keep their distance from my child, and if they try to argue, just ignore unless they actually get closer to the child. Then I would yell at them to stay away from my child. I think “child” will be a trigger word for the crazies and the non-crazies alike to side with you. “Stay the fuck away from my child, you creeper!”","Thank you for your thoughtful response. You’re right on with everything you said and their seeking negative attention so I should just not feed into that. I did speak up the other day when an antimasker got too close at a checkout and my kid was with me. I didn’t use the key word “child” but I will definitely do that next time.",2
