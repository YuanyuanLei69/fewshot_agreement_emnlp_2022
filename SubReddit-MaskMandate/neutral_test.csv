Being a smoker made me very sad but it is also a terrible addiction. I don’t think people shaming smokers would do much beyond making an already sad person sadder.I think we should shame and go after the companies that make and sell such an obviously evil product.

He's worried about being a pain (he's not) and he can't tell what we are feeling anymore.Our solution has been to start using more hand gestures. When he comes in and asks how I'm doing, I don't just smile and say ""I'm good, how about you?"" any more. I wave to let him know I've acknowledged his entrance, and give a thumbs up to indicate my positive mood while I speak to him. He says this has helped him with social interactions.

So you see masks as a long term solution? The thought that masks are here to stay for years or possibly forever makes me really sad personally.
