"Yeah, because I’m so scared of a 3% mortality rate","3% of 7 billion is 234,000,000 people dead, you fucking moron, which doesn’t account for the millions of people left with lifelong health problems. even if you’re not scared of a highly infectious virus, you still have an obligation to care about other people who are higher-risk. all antimaskers should be in fucking jail idc",0

"CDC recommendation is that even fully vaccinated people are still supposed to wear masks in public indoor areas. Pretty simple honestly","""You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart.

"It is basic logic.  People that cannot grasp the concept of how a mask provides more help than harm are probably not likely to be convinced.   It would almost assuredly be a waste of your time.Ask them to point to some empirical evidence on how masks are bad.","They don't stop virusses. I said: Yes they don't stop viruses, they stop the moisture where the virus is.But he still doesn't get it.",0

There’s a pandemic with the death rate of about 2mil and you think a mask that’s meant to protect other as well as yourself from a virus is in some way shape or form a muzzle?
