"Aww I thought the whole idea was My rights are more important than anyone’s feelings. Don’t you have a god given right to be a dickhead? I smell hypocrisy.","This is all over Reddit. I’ve accidentally offended users I didn’t know were mods and was then subsequently banned from every sub the guy moderated “for being an asshole”. Subs with other mods relinquished the ban but they weren’t anything I’d ever comment in or join.. I think the whole mod system needs to be revamped. The appeal process is hard to run through on a sub with one rogue mod or others where only one active mod is left.. or people using multiple accounts as different mods. It’s pretty corrupt. Echo chambers are very much alive. Add false information to that and it becomes disastrous..",2
"I seriously wanted to name drop him, but it was probably not a good idea.","Just do it. Fuck him.",2
"While I will never agree that this sub should exist and will always think antimaskers are lunatics, them banning you is not going against your free speech. Just like Reddit shutting down that subreddit would not be going against their right of free speech.","Exactly this. Totally agree. It has nothing to do with free speech. There are so many that don't understand what free speech is about",2
"Well looks like someone really wants to get and spread the virus. That mask would look better if it had a mask that actually provided protection under it.","I do. I believe it’s the only way we’ll beat it. Run it through the young and strong population to protect the weak population. Just like every other virus.",2
"r/coronavirus really needs to crack down on economic impact concern trolling and general virus skeptic posts.  Anyone else notice how bad it is?","I certainly have. They are part of what inspired this thread.",2
"Sadly it's not. There are small businesses pulling this shit and helping to spread the virus just to appeal to the morons.

This is why they're spreading the variants so quickly.","Let's just hope those businesses stay small",2
"Honestly, just say that they can't shop in the store without a mask. If they can't put one on they need to leave.Any push back then say, ""I'm going to call the police now,"" and walk away.","Yep, as soon as they refuse it becomes trespassing.",2
"What a fucking racist tool---I want to punch her so much.","I imagined those big ass racist teeth missing as well.",2
"That would work but then the antimaskers will realize they’re wrong and pull out there big ole ar15 and start shooting civis like a yeeyeebuckaroo","They'll recognize fellow antimaskers and start shooting each other for that $1,000. Trust me greed overcomes all with this bunch. That's why they're opposing the mandates: greed and self-gain!",2

In fact: here at the ICU, we will make new holes in your body, as you sleep! And then stick more tubes in those!And now with our special COVID offer, you can have tubes for the rest of your life! So come on in. We’re your Intensive Care Unit, and we have Tubes For YOU!","Don't forget our special group packages!",2
"Mine are too, I have asked and asked... but to no avail, they do not listen. It’s frustrating.","it's so awesome that you kids know better. it's got to be so maddening though to be trapped around that chosen ignorance!",2
"I’m glad her mask was protecting her chins","Together we will defeat the chin virus",2
"My local PD won’t arrest or ticket em even though there is a citywide mask mandate so I’ve just gotta be happy watching it happen elsewhere.","Maskholes usually aren't just getting a ticket for not wearing one, they're getting cited and arrested for trespassing",2
"Weird, scary and kinda dystopian... I wouldn’t want to be in that situation, my social anxiety would kill me","I was just freaked out by the fact that they didn’t seem to be from my hometown. I’m a small town in Western Kentucky and we don’t see many people like that here. I truly was an experience that I don’t want to happen again.",2
"Nothing makes anti-maskers look good","Was just about to comment this myself lol",2

"Ours has a guy at each entrance making sure people are wearing masks. Unfortunately some of the employees still wear them improperly as in under their noses. They are often found working around food. Yeah I get it you wear glasses and they fog up. I wear glasses to and yet I wear mine over my nose.","There's really no reason not to wear a mask correctly. It's only slightly more understandable with employees since we have to wear a mask for 6+ hours everyday but they see others wearing it correctly, what makes them so special? Aside from looking stupid, the mask moves more and pulls on your ears more aggressively Idk I'm just fed up",2
"This fucking pisses me off my fucking aunt just died of covid are you fucking kidding me I hope the person goes to hell","I’m sorry for your loss. I wish people would think about the pain and suffering as a result of them being inconsiderate rather than “it’s just a number.” These are real human lives with families.",2
"Well, atleast they're smart enough to find overly specific laws and acts (that don't really apply to them) that are  unknown enough that people won't know when they misuse them","Welcome to right-wing world...these anti-maskers use this same line over and over again. There's plenty of YouTube videos where store managers are trained well, and tell them to Eff off, masks are mandatory.",2
"2003: This is bad, it could be worse, let's get ready. 2005: This is bad, it could be worse, let's get ready. 2014: This is bad, it could be worse, let's get ready. 2016: This is bad, it could be worse, let's get ready. 2019: This is bad, it could be worse, let's get ready. 2020: Times up. In hindsight... We saw it coming.","yeah, about that. this wont be the last one",2
"Yes, let's make this pandemic last even longer! Then let's complain about it!","That’s just it. I sometimes watch the ultra-Trump channel RSBN on YouTube just to get an idea of exactly how these people think. The presenter was talking to some guy in Arizona who had run for office (and failed) as a Trump Republican. They were saying how California should completely open up on Jan 1... I mean, really?! Then complaining about restaurants going bankrupt. If people had actually stuck to the rules things would be able to open up quicker. These anti mask/anti lockdown types seem to be totally oblivious to the fact that it’s their actions which have prolonged this thing in the first place. And saying “healthy people shouldn’t wear masks”, because clearly they’ve ignored everything we know about asymptomatic transmission and being able to spread Covid for days before you start to get symptoms. It’s insane. And dangerous.",2
"I love that anti-maskers love to pick and choose when we should listen to health officials.","Basking in their hypocrisy.",2
"You should tell her wearing a mask is the same as telling people not to drink and drive. Sure you can drink and drive and not necessarily kill someone else, but because you choose to drink and drive your chances of killing someone increase. The same as choosing not to wear a mask. But they are an idiot and they won’t see the it because they don’t want to see it.I’m sorry for your loss and I’m sorry for you having to deal with people like that.","I didn’t use that particular example but similar ones for sure and they’re not the same “because there isn’t someone watching and forcing you to put one on.”",2
"Is there a way to report misinformation on YouTube? I don't see a category that matches.","I already sent a report to YouTube under harmful acts.

Hope they do something about this.",2
"I’m completely healthy therefore I don’t need to wear a mask but I have health issues that will make me pass out if I wear a mask? The problem  is people like her think they are the smart ones. Smh","Uggh, I’m so sick of these fake know it all’s. Someone needs to punch her.",2
"Why do anti maskers have the worst arguments and the most selfish reasoning? Like, no, this isn’t just about you, you stupid asshole. This is a highly contagious virus. My a few months back were down to ZERO cases. Then, this one, SINGLE, LONE jackass came back to the city after visiting like 5 hotspot countries at the time. He ended up catching Covid and indeed of isolating and staying home. This guy ran, basically a dozen errands a day at many locations. Now, my city is in code red, we aren’t allowed to buy anything deemed “non-essential”. Any store that doesn’t sell food or meds is basically shut down. My city is a pubic hair away from complete lockdown like Italy.","It's basically because they are intellectually and academically stupid. I honestly can't explain their intelligence in simpler terms. Easily gullible, lack of critical thinking skills, etc...",2
"Because there is a chance we may get the virus, though our chances of getting it are lower than without the vaccine. If we get the virus the symptoms will likely be much milder for us because we have the vaccine. But we can still spread the virus to others around us and we care about others. We especially care about people with compromised immune systems, the elderly, and children who cannot get vaccinated (and all of the potentially vulnerable people they interact with and may pass the virus onto).

Why do unvaccinated people not wear masks? Because they don't care about others and they are the kind of people stupid enough to ask this question (in a sub that is making fun of them) and genuinely not know the answer and not understand it when it is laid out for them.","Exactly",2
"It’s catchy","ikr my favorite part is the part with the tea pot i forgot her name tho",2
"Guys there’s no point in trying to help this person change their mind he obviously has a mental illness and thinks that everything is a hoax he probably thinks that rich people are lizards and he probably still thinks that spongebob is real","I know rich people exist as I am one of them.",2
"How are people so fucking dumb","I don’t know brother, I don’t know",2
"Herein lies the real problem.  There are many people out there trying to convince anti-maskers the truth, however, no amount of facts or logic will make them change their mind.  Because they are too rigid in their way of thinking to be willing to even consider accepting something that runs against what they believe.","Good ol cognitive dissonance at work... love it.",2
"Sorry to break it to you but your the child of a retard. Welcome to the club! My pops is retarded too!","Yep",2
"Just carry an extra mask and put it over your existing mask while making eye contact and not speaking.","HAHA definitely doing this, 100%",2
"I very possibly am reading this wrong but the main thing I see is that this wasn’t a test. It seems they compared states with mandates to states without mandates which doesn’t make much sense because no state has real adherence to the mandate. My state has a mandate and even though I’d estimate probably at least 90% of people in public wear a mask I’d say close to 50% don’t wear them properly.

Plus there’s the issue of type of mask. A lot of people wear neck gaiter which offer little protection.","That is why there should be immediate $200 for anyone not wearing a mask properly outside the homes

You don’t even need to do this with officers everywhere. You could review CCTV footage from stores after the fact to identify and fine people who don’t wear it correctly.",2
"Millions of people died from a vaccine? They just slipped that claim in with all the others","Exactly. They just say anything, Trump style, knowing a bunch of idiots are already primed to believe it without question. This planet needs to reset itself again.",2
"I made it to 4:53 before I had to stop the video. She clearly has mental issues and I feel sorry for anyone that knows her, or has to deal with her.","I lost it before that.  I found if you tap the right arrow to can take the statements in small bursts.  She ends with ""Only democrats are dying of covid.""",2
"Tickets in our country we have to wear mask even at home which is fucking bullshit because i am in a sorority so there is is like 20 of us in a house and because we are loud the neighbours call the cops and they come some of us cant find there masks and we get a ticket...","That's BS that you have to wear masks indoors. We have to wear it while driving - even if we're alone in the car!",2
"Who tf downvoted somebodys loss like that","Idk but at least 9 people are going to hell :)",2
"Private businesses can make whatever rules they like as long as they don't discriminate against a protected class.

Anti maskers are CONSTANTLY circumventing these rules by wearing mesh mask, no mask, or masks under their nose. Requiring people to confront them and clearly ignoring the law that private businesses 100% have every right to ask them to comply or leave.

My issue is that. Don't go in a place that wants you to wear a mask if you don't want to. It's the assholes that think using one of the above mentioned alternatives instead that need to fuck off.","Get vaccinated and you need not worry about anti masters! They're anti science, people like us used to wear a mask but now don't thanks to the vaccine!",2
"You don’t take a medicine for parasites to deal with a virus.

You don’t take medicine to deal with bacteria to deal with a virus.

This should be common sense and it’s horrifying that it isn’t.","Many antivaccinaters don't even think viruses exist, and that's probably why they don't know the difference.",2
"Boohoo. Cry me a river.","Most of the families of those parients Will, viven their relatives might die",2
"cops gonna arrest you every time when you refuse to identify yourself.

If you refuse, the only sensible reason is because you have warrants out.","This. If she didn't do anything wrong, she wouldn't have anything to hide.",2
"Im MeDiCaLy ExEmPt","I'm logically exempt",2
"""126 years ago"" is an oddly specific number. Were the late 1890s supposed to be turning point or something?","Of course, everyone knows freedom ended exactly 126 years ago",2
"And people wonder why bullying is such an issue? You've got bullies raising bullies. A cycle of violence and assholes.","Top comment material right here!",2
"You're one of the people who would have cheerfully snitched on Anne Frank, aren't you.","He's carrying on his family legacy.Snitches get stitches.",2
"If you have all of these new guidelines in writing, contacting a local media outlet might also be worthwhile. Most TV news outlets will allow you to do this anonymously since you'd have a legitimate fear of retribution from your employer.","This, totally.",2
"I'm guessing she doesn't have a medical condition.","True.",2
"The reason why she hasn't been confronted about the mask is because so many people have gotten aggressive or violent when approached, that some chain stores have just said not to approach them, that it's not worth the risk of a physical confrontation.Or, perhaps, because they can sense her solid Karen core and know it's pointless to argue with a selfish brick wall.Edit: Oh hey it's my cake day.","Can confirm that’s the way it is at Lowe’s",2
"Did she just compare 6 months of mask wearing to centuries of racism and discrimination AS WELL as being gassed by the millions? That while clearly being more than well fed not in need (not discriminating... i am more than well fed and not in need too... SO I CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT MY LIFE)","That about sums it up, yeah.",2
"People like this make me feel embarrassed to be an American","Oof there are horrible people here in Europe but don’t let a Shannon just copy paste a troll article of why anti masking is a good thing",2
"Persons who refuse to wear masks are basically disrespectful towards others, but there is a much stronger reason why masks need to be worn. There are certain times where society's needs out weighs an individual's ""rights"". Example, at times of war where the country as a whole is threatened citizens are drafted into the military against their will because the country's need to survive outweighs individual liberties. Same with Covid. Right now the USA is being attacked by Covid with ""battle field"" deaths at over 750,000. Very much like any traditional war. Masks, vaccinations and personal conduct are necessary to fight this invader. Anything less would amount to giving aid and comfort to the enemy, which is treason.","I’m in complete agreement. I think they are treasonous.",2
"This person is so stupid... I can barely make sense of what they're writing. They think they're being discriminated!?  Their ordeal at the grocery store was not discrimination! It's them being selfish and stubborn asses.","Just inject her the virus and wait :)",2
"I don't wear a mask for me; I've already had COVID more than a year ago (it sucked big time) and I've also been fully vaccinated. I'm not worried about getting it again because I probably have some of the strongest antibodies out there.

I wear a mask for those who are vulnerable, just in case I have somehow been reinfected but am asymptomatic. Also to let them know that they don't need to be afraid of getting it from me, because they don't know my situation.

I certainly don't wear a mask to get laid, and I especially do not do it to impress this particularly stupid botoxed Covidiot. Why would I even begin to care what you think about the size of my balls? Unless they are so big that I need two seats on an airplane, then it's none of your damn business.","Rightly so, it's not about YOU whether you've had the vaccine or not you could still spread it and infect others.",2
"Translation: ""We found six nutjobs online, so we're going to report on this as though it were a trend to be taken seriously.""","Eh, Hopefully the other nutjobs will follow the example.",2
"These antimasker imbeciles are a sad bunch trying to troll this sub. I love it when they start using logical fallacy terms in an effort to checkmate us, lol, so cute.","I have tears in my eyes from laughing lol, The amount of strawmen and tu quoque in this guy's comments are insane lol.",2
"You gotta be a real, true idiot to say “no science”. That’s a new level of stupidity.","Meanwhile he is hosting a sweaty hard breathing super spreader event every day",2
"It must be embarrassing these days to actually say that you are a Republican","It's embarrassing to me to say I used to be one. Can't believe I didn't see the crazy coming.",2
"Yeah, its Walmart. I'm not surprised, just dissapointed.","Yeah",2
"I swear to God, if there was a giant cloud of radioactive dust that settled over the US, people would be going out anyways","This already happened in March 2011, the Fukushima cloud really touched the  northern side of the american continent.",2
"You're fine as long as you rinse off your fruits and veggies, which you should anyway, at least as far as covid goes. Other viruses, eh who knows, like, the bottom of a can sitting on your counter.. probably not as bad as how unpleasant of an experience that was. It's a darn shame, people gonna be stupid, haven't ya always known. We didn't need to be fighting this damn ghost and each other at the same time. Fucking anti maskers, I am starting to pity them even in their willful ignorance.","There's no cure for stupid",2
"I’m so sorry for your loss.  Once the dust has settled, contact an attorney and discuss a civil lawsuit against her employer, and the asshole employee who refused to wear a mask.  Someone needs to pay for what happened.","State mandates (at least most of them) REQUIRE you to wear a mask. The company that OP's Sis in law works at could not only be facing a disregard of public safety lawsuit, but also OSHA could be on their ass like stink on shit if they catch wind of it. There might be even more penalties that come with faliure to make masks mandatory in that workplace too. (Pretty sure that itself is a charge - but I'm no law worker)",2
"They’ve pushed me to the point where I hope they die from COVID, the gene pool needs a bit of cleaning.","This is something I can get behind.",2
"I ordered masks just like this from 'breathepraylove' and they're amazing. You can actually wear them for more than a few minutes without having to gasp for air or breathe in your own carbon dioxide just to be able to shop or enjoy going out in public. I usually don't wear one at all because I get anxiety from the feeling of my face being covered up and it's almost debilitating for me, (can't concentrate, can't enjoy things, can't get anything done or think clearly. It's an insane distraction) and these type of masks are a miracle for other people like me and myself, when we're at an establishment where people haggle you if you don't have your face covered.","Aren’t they awesome!? It’s why I made the commercial! I just wish I would have remembered I wasn’t speaking french the entire time... jumped around a little with the languages lol",2
"This is actually one time when skin color really matters. There have been several studies showing a strong link between vitamin D deficiency and more severe cases of COVID. The darker your skin, the less vitamin D your body produces in sunlight. I'm sure that quality of health care also plays a role, which is something we really need to fix.","Might be something to look into",2
"Holy fuck that's a lot of crazy dumb for two people","Yep its not going to stop",2
"Titans aren't *real*, man.  It's all part of a government conspiracy from the folks in the inner ring.  Even if they were real, they were probably engineered by someone to ruin the economy and help sell steampunk Spiderman equipment!","Reopen wall Maria the titans are a hoax.",2
"I've deleted all of my social media accounts except for reddit. I can filter out most of the stupid on here.","I usually don't have to see the stupidity because I only follow a small amount of people. This lady decided to have this awful opinion on a page dedicated to YouTube drama about a podcast. Very odd place to choose to share your terrible opinion on Covid lol.",2
"Highly disappointing. Hopefully you are able to start looking for different employment? If not, all the best to you stranger and I hope you stay healthy. Also, fuck your employer.","I am planning to move cross country this summer and was hoping to transfer within the company so at least I'd be guaranteed work once I moved and then could start looking for something new once relocated, but I think the time to start looking is now. Thank you, I'll do my best to stay healthy and wish nothing but good health to you too.Thank you for your comment. And agreed, fuck them.",2
"You aren't. There are too many goddamn idiots in this country.","We need a global culling.",2
"Have you noticed that ""Do some research"" is often said by people who speak and spell like they haven't cracked a book since second grade?","Yes, and research to them is ""I saw it on Facebook"".",2
"She is a vocal anti masker and is basically saying “I want to do what I want so just avoid me” as if that is easy to do in public. Wear a dang mask people, it’s not that hard.","She sounds wonderful",2

"Even if shes not an antimasker (she has one on in the first place) this is still extremely idiotic","For sure, only reason I posted was because she did this for about 5 minutes waiting in line. Finger in the mask and everything.",2
"Looks like this person sucks at her job since she thinks masks don't help. Ugh egos.","She definitely believes she is THE main authority on masks and loves to hear herself talk.",2
"Gotta love that capitalist mindset where personal possessions are objectively more valuable than human lives.","Property = a persons time, effort and hard work = their life. What you're saying is that one person's life is more important than another's.",2

Ow.","You know, the anti-maskers do share a very serious medical condition impairing their breathing, so we need to be understanding of those suffering from Head-Up-Assitis. I mean, it’s even worse than Covid-19 as it can spread by Facebook, Reddit, and text messages. And in many cases, the side effects can be horrific - turning people into rabid Karens, foaming at the mouth, waving Freedom to Breathe Agency exemption cards, demanding to see the manager.

"Seriously... How did we get here in the first place?How did wearing masks to prevent the spread of an airborne disease become a strong ""rights"" issue??How did it become the ""pussy"" thing to do??H-O-W????","When trump denounced the virus for so long and made it seem like no big deal, his supporters are so brain rotted they just can’t wear the masks because it’s against their ‘freedom’ I can’t really wrap my head around it either, but sure as shit I can wrap a mask around my head.",2
"Also surgeons would be collapsing into their patients if face masks restricted oxygen the way some of these plague rats think they do.","When I had my 8 hour surgery, I was told I had 22 surgeons and only 3 died!  The rest recovered and were able to perform other surgeries after 10 days.",2
"I know 4 people who have it currentlyJust because you never have seen a volcano eruption- doesn’t make it “fake”","Exactly, it's the same thinking of saying just because you haven't seen a car crash it means they aren't real, just because it doesn't happen to YOU specifically doesn't mean it doesn't to literally anyone else in the world, does that mean people are faking getting injured from car crashes?

"So china is handling much better than us god trumps in some deep shit after he's out office","Yes",2

I’ve personally lived through the retail nightmare and quite frankly If I was working one of these positions and this shit started happening I would absolutely snap.
