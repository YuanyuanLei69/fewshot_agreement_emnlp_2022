"You realize this is a server making fun of anti-maskers, not for anti-maskers, right?","I’m not surprised an anti masker (OP) can’t read the description lmao",2
"Internet hugs my friend. I get it. Thanks to anti maskers 3 of my family members who live out of state have the virus. One has an immune disorder. Thankfully they are so far doing ok. People who wear their masks improperly like under the nose are also part of the problem. I live with my parents who are both high risk. These stupid anti maskers are making life harder for the rest of us. I can't wait for the vaccine.","You mean the vaccine that will not only create mindless zombies, but also be laced with nanobots to track and control you, that is also deadlier than getting Covid, and it’s the governments plan to make it so that you need a vaccine boaster every 3 months for the rest of your life?That vaccine? Lol. As soon as that shit goes public, both my wife and I will be first get to get it.",2
"COVIDIOTS. They are NOT patriots, they are selfish.","Definitely!! This was the mall that was shut down for 2 days for a deep cleaning, From the article: An evacuee from Wuhan, China, who had been under quarantine was released Saturday from the Texas Center for Infectious Disease after twice testing negative for the virus. The results of a third test showed she was “weakly” positive for the virus, forcing officials to retrace her steps during the roughly 12 hours she was in the community.",2
"I work in a medical clinic and have seen a lot of people refusing to wear masks… with elderly (masked) people on oxygen sitting right by them. These people have no shame. Completely disgusting.","I have colleagues with spouses who allegedly have cancer and they still don't wear masks. WTF!",2
"Just curious..why do you guys love masks so much?","virtue signalling gives them a perceived sense of purpose in life within their miserable groupthink realities",2
"I still wear one if a worker has to wear one. If they are wearing it to keep me safe I can do the same for them.","Same. And I say it's in solidarity with the working class.",2
"First get some evidence just to be sure,ring camera footage would be perfect if you have it. If not the amount of packages not delivered to your house would probably be enough. Report it to FedEx. I had an issue wirh a driver who verbally assaulted a coworker of mine at work because she told him he couldn't come in without a mask, I emailed FedEx support and have my address and what he looked like. Q week later I get an email and I'm told he's been moved off my route and I won't be seeing him again.","Thank you for the good advice.",2
"That’s like the Simpsons treehouse of horror when the zombies want brains, they tap on homers head and leave him angrily saying “grrr BRAINSSS!!!”(Implying he has none)","Yes I was thinking the same thing!",2
"These people are just so proud of themselves. The utter stupidity it takes to wear that shirt AND ignore masking in a Wal mart shows us her IQ…","yup, she went there with no other purpose than pissing people off",2
"People who don't wear masks **correctly** should be charged with a crime and heavily fined.There is no reason you can't wear a little bit of fabric over your nose and mouth. Just do it and quit whining like a little bitch.","IKR. I've gotten so sick of seeing people wearing their masks improperly I got masks that say ""The Mask Goes Over Your Nose"". It actually worked. A guy's wife saw my mask and told her husband to fix his mask.",2

"I just tell em I'm from Canada. We gotta cover our faces with ski masks and thick scarves from late October to late spring in some places to avoid frostbite and we're fine. A mask won't kill you, it's thinner than anything we have to wear to keep our noses from turning black and breaking off.","Well, when there's a reason there's a reason.",2
"Imagine comparing literally saving lives to fucking slave abuse","I saw one in the real world who compared it to the Holocaust",2
"It’s that same arsehole that looks like a member of Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem in the Schak Trucking of Tyler, MN t-shirt.","Which is, interestingly, a federally regulated shipping company licensed for food transport.  The cool thing about trucking companies is that *tons* of contact information is sitting out there on the web.  It would be a real shame if someone were to reach out to OSHA, the fmcsa, or any of their corporate contacts.  Seems like it might be a health hazzard worthy of their attention.",2
"Ah yes, the CO2 that gets trapped in my airtight cloth mask","I put a bag over my head with a rubber band around my neck to hold it in place. In all seriousness though, do these people think that face shields also cause SO/ poisoning? If they need surgery, are they going to require their surgeons to not wear masks because they may pass out from CO2 poisoning?? Fucking idiots",2
"It's a thin piece of tissue, your rights are not being violated, you can breathe, it isn't a huge deal stop being babies. Do you think doctors are dogs and being controlled when they wear a mask? Jesus.","I was just thinking that! I mean, how outrageously weak willed and weak minded does one have to be to be 'controlled' by a small piece of fabric worn occasionally over the lower half of your face?

SO weak.",2
"Lmao thats how attention whores who do stupid shit for clout are born","Yep she will be an attention whore when she grows up just like her mother",2
"“I’m an idiot who wants attention. Please look at me”That’s why he’s doing this and filming it. Also, the hilarity at calling that woman a Karen. Someone doesn’t know how to properly use that terminology","He keeps using that word, I do not think it means what he thinks it does.",2
"I got into a bit of a fight with one of my older sister last night when she came out and told me that she thinks,  'if you are not going to wear an N95 mask, you should not wear any mask at all'.And sadly, I couldn't get her to understand that wearing any effective mask properly is better than wearing no mask at all.  :(  Considering she's in the vulnerable list when it comes to Covid, I can't understand her willful stupidity.","She doesn’t seem to understand even with a mask being around others who aren’t wearing one their germs are still getting in her eyes, hair and clothes so she can get sick. Everyone has to wear a mask properly to avoid making others sick.  Also some people think if they feel good they aren’t carrying the virus and that’s wrong. Wearing a mask protects your nose and mouth but others must wear a mask to keep your safe.",2
"Of course it's Indiana. So many here just cant be bothered to do such a simple thing…","As someone who has lived here all my life, I absolutely agree",2
"That is impressive. I wear mask but I have found it difficult to hike with one on. I hike outside on lightly trafficked trails. If I see someone, I will put my mask immediately on until we pass and get some space between us. I even bought one of the Under Armour sport masks. It was better and extremely comfortable, but it was difficult to hike with it on still. These are also not afternoon walks. These are all incline hikes and strenuous. I feel bad that I take off the mask, not because I am a ""sheeple,"" but because I am trying to be as safe as I can and respectful to my fellow citizens.","Ha, thanks. And yeah, totally understandable. For skiing or climbing or mountain biking, I just avoid people the best that I can, but always try to carry a mask with me when going anywhere aside from my home. No, my experience is not universal, some people might struggle more; but a mask is so universally low on troublesome things it’s hard to believe that some people don’t put in some sort of effort.",2
"Eh whatever. There's a venue in Florida selling concert tickets for $18 if you're vaccinated, and $999 if you aren't. Fuck that greasy spoon diner anyway. Probably catch worse than COVID eating there.","What peeves me is that anti maskers continually challenge mask mandates saying they're unconstitutional but then go ahead and do this.",2
"No sound?","It's not just me then.",2
"Well they look like well balanced human beings.......","Sure, in the sense that weebles wobble, but they don't fall down.",2
"She looks like she could bite the shit out of you.","She looks like a shark with a mental disability (no hate to people with mental disabilities tho)",2
"Ah, yes. Everything that works is banned and everything that doesn't
work is endorsed, and all these just happen to coincide with your way of
thinking.","Everything's a conspiracy these days if you're a complete idiot.",2
"I’m sorry you have to deal with that as a line level employee. I would like to think that management would look out for their employees, but unfortunately they don’t. I’ve found that it depends on what you say. I always try to be sickly sweet. Like, “Yo, King. I noticed you lost your mask. That’s totally no bueno Broseph. I bet if you go check in your car, you probably have an extra. It’s all Gucci. We all have been there”.","lol yes! ""kill em with kindness as they say."" ill use ur quote verbatim next time it would have been perfect verbage for this guy cuz he was a big buff guy in tank top just daring someone to call him out..but he thought (i assume) ""these teenagers at this pizza shop will be too intimidated to say something."" then complains online like a snowflake.",2
"George Carlin said the following joke years ago and it definitely applies to our current situation.  “Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about: politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F*ck Hope.”George Carlin","I agree. I have lost faith that voting and democracy is even the best system because when so much of the public is so stupid that all we do is allow varies types of criminals to run the country whether they are twisted enough to be anti mask or not...well we have we we have now...a full blown autocratic radical religious party trying to size control by violence and cheating and a pro corporation rightleaning ""democratic"" party fighting the antimask  monkeys for control. Shit and shittier if you will.",2
"I live in Florida. So yes. For sure. It's the Twilight Zone out here. Half of the people in my daily life who I really liked, circa 2019, are apparently bonkers. So disorienting.","I agree. My father in law believes that if you get the vaccine, you can spread covid. So he told us if we got vaccinated, he wouldn't watch our son anymore because we'd spread it to him and he'd spread it to them. He's 2.

He still doesn't know I'm vaccinated and probably never will.",2
"I can only assume anti-maskers want Covid to be a problem for another few years.","I mean they were willing to attempt a coup, who knows what else they’ll do",2
"Tangents everywhere.","That’s how they are. It’s impossible for them to stay on a single thought for more than a sentence. It’s maddening.",2
"I believe that Nazi's are bad, the other side believes they are good, let's compromise...

Nope. Let THEM reach across the aisle. They never, ever do.","Yeah, Im trying to ""prove"" it to the ""censorship is bad at any level"" crowd",2
"Man I sure hope she'd post this. This person has it figured out. You do you and I'll do me. Don't try to make me do your thing just because you're scared.","Don't worry, I'm with you.",2
"I don’t understand these people’s logic. Like why bother wearing a mask if you’re just going to use it as a chin protection? You don’t breathe through your chin. He just look like an idiot","Most places around where I live wont let you in without a mask, but then wont further enforce it. So a bunch of people come in with masks on and as soon as theyre past the doorman the ""muzzle comes off"" as my anti-mask family put it.",2
"No. Have you ever realized cool kids arent... Smart?","Would you rather be smart or would you rather get laid",2
"I didn't see anybody cumbling.","Who is downvoting you?

No one crumbled. It ended with him still arguing the same point.",2
"“I’m a medical professional”... translation she answers the phone at the dentist","She shreds the paper from these clinics.

Medical and dental office assistants usually know enough science not to suck this hard.",2
"Maybe when care-rationing becomes necessary, Anti-maskers should be sent to the end of the line.","When the vaccine is finally released, anti-maskers should not be allowed to get it. According to them, it's only a placebo anyway. Ha ha ha, ignorant morons. Insurance companies should start canceling insurance policies when their clients are found on social media not wearing a mask. Maybe life insurance policies should be voided if someone who died from covid is found to be an anti-masker. Or we should just corral them all together in a building and lock them in until the virus finishes it's business. Who are we to get in the way of natural selection?",2
"I love this officer. He didn’t sit though the bullshit. “Have a nice day” don’t let them argue for some reason they get off from it..","The “whatever” at the end made me crack a smile",2
"This is why I don't say anything to people. I'm pregnant and scared to be assaulted for trying to stay safe. No one should be assaulted where they work for enforcing the rules that keep people safe.","My wife goes nowhere because she is pregnant. She is terrified to protect her self.  What the fuck is wrong with us?",2
"I smoke a pack a day (I know I know, I’ve been trying to quit for awhile and have been failing miserably). I have literally smoked through my mask to win this argument with anti-maskers in the past.","Love this kind of comments",2
"Damn that would be fun.

Some of their bullshit would be easy to exaggerated into lunacy like that.

If you believe people are drinking baby blood you might be easy to fool.","Most of their bullshit would be hard not to exaggerate into lunacy because it's exactly exaggerated lunacy.",2
"Man we had some nutters do this in my hometown, like 50 year old men roaming around in joker masks at the local Trader Joe’s. This is some real boomer 1st world anarchism right here.","They want to feel special.",2
"even a broken clock is correct sometime","2/86,400th of the time...",2
"american conservatives have a culture of being the most selfish pricks ive ever seen in my life.

“fuck you i got mine” is the entire rural white culture. the funny part is, theyre poor as fuck.","And at least the dumbest…",2
"There is no laws requiring you to wear a mask, but any business that denies entry for people without masks had the right to kick you out and call the police to get them to kick you out as it’s their property and their rights.","Yup anyone who would walk into someone's house with a big knife and say 'its my right' will understand trespassing a little bit quicker",2
"I cannot wait to look back on this shit a few years from now and see what these anti-masks idiot have to say about their bullshit when history proves that masks were helpful. Will they feel guilt? I doubt it. They'll have some excuse.","They’ll probably come up with an argument about how we should be thanking them because thanks to their actions we are now free and the “elite” realized they could not “control” us",2
"My thought is if they refuse to wear a mask, then hospitals should refuse them care.","i agree 100% refuse them ventilators too!",2
"All u can do is be polite. U can't change a POS!","Exactly",2
"brigading isnt really rule-conforming, dude","Oh sorry I didn’t look at the rules. I’m just gonna delete this",2
"I would love to debate someone and see what they say to defend that position. There is not one single legitimate reason for these people to despise a square of cloth so rigorously.","Because the alt right media sez too! I mean, that is the main cause, plus the fake conspiracy theories.",2
"If they're not scared of a lil' virus, then they shouldn't be scared of a visit to the Emergency Room.","The point is, that if they aren’t going to adhere to guidelines, why should anyone have to treat them? Why should others in hospitals have to be in proximity to them? Why? Why? Why?

It seems more apropos to say, “if they’re not afraid of the virus, they should be willing to ride it out at home like the tough fighters of tyranny that they are.”",2
"always surprised that covid is the hill the anti maskers decide to die on. and always wonder why are they so angry? and angry at the wrong people too? where is the rage for the orange ferret wearing treason weasel who let 500k americans die?","Fear. Fear does a lot of strange things (or can, any way) to the human mind.",2
"I agree with you.

Trump being President during the pandemic and calling it a hoax, refusing to wear a mask, etc. certainly emboldened his idiot followers to do the same.","If Trump had come out and instead said it was unpatriotic to not wear a mask, we'd have this covered (no pun intended), and OAN and FOX would be declaring anyone who didn't wear a mask to be a commie traitor.",2
"They should be banned, Reddit wouldn’t tolerate a sub around drunk driving. The anti-maskers are no different.","Truth!",2
"id say karen attractor they love going off on random people just because they wear a mask","True ahaha",2
"The bad news is there is no such mask that protects you or others.  The good news is the virus has a mortality rate of 0.03% so you don’t really have to worry about protecting yourself or others.","Yesssss. Exactly.",2
"I adore how people somehow miss the point of masks so much that they take it off to talk to people. I thought humanity was supposed to be the most intelligent species on Earth, turns out we're just the least unintelligent.","I like the ones that take off their mask to talk (loudly) on their cell phone.",2
"I fully agree that anti maskers should get a fine or some kind of punishment; they're worse than anti vaxxers. My 20th birthday was in April, the beginning of lockdown here in Delaware, and I had a whole 1920's themed party planned out that I had to cancel because America couldn't be bothered to take any precautions while the virus was still on the other side of the world. Many other countries have already beaten COVID and are back to normal while we're stuck here with biggest population of idiots on Earth.","It’s amazing at how people with a 4th grade education are suddenly massive experts on rights and freedoms and know the exact wording on the constitution. I used to laugh at sovereign citizen videos but now they just make me depressed because it’s so rampant now.",2
"That lady is nuts. Thank you to you and your girlfriend for all you have been doing to help during this crazy time. You are out there risking yourselves trying to save lives.","Thank you!!! We really try hard!!! In the beginning, we were treated as heroes… now I am not entirely sure how we are being treated.",2
"If I was there it would be so hard for me not to drag her out by her hair","Ikr she's so unbelievably annoying, god knows how shop employees deal with these crazy bastards all the time now, I wouldn't have the patience knowing someone is endangering everyone around them because wearing a mask for 5 minutes is too uncomfortable for them. The entitlement pisses me off so goddamn much, you having to breathe with a mask on for 5 minutes VS other people breathing out of a ventilator and possibly dying because you couldn't stand those 5 minutes with a mask.",2
"Ah, the ""Do your own research"" crowd. Always good for a laugh.","I love when I share actual information and they respond with blurry screenshots from propaganda websites riddled with typos",2

"This bothers me so much! First of all, you don’t parent somebody else’s kids. Second, those kids look scared and uncomfortable. You didn’t do anything to help them, they took them off because they were SCARED of you. I can’t stand people like this. It’s one thing not to wear one yourself (still scummy as heck) but targeting someone else, especially a CHILD takes it to a whole new level of cruelty.","it almost seems like this might be child abuse....(oh wait, I forgot, making kids wear masks is clearly child abuse)

"Wow, what a failure of human evolution for us to get here","""Defund education"" they said.  ""It'll save tax dollars"" they said.",2
"These people are legit like children. They know the deal, its been ages at this point. They’re simply limit testing. Ive been working at a covid testing site for a while. Every now and then we get someone who walks in without a mask. When I tell them to wear a mask they get annoyed but always comply. Or they act like they forgot. They’re hoping I don’t say anything so they can tell their story of walking around unmasked like a lion amongst sheep, and no one telling them anything about it because they’re so badass. In reality people are just sick and tired of policing grown ass fucking adults like they’re toddlers.","Exactly!! Well said!",2

"Her nose, looks so punchable","Her whole face does!Prime example of a waste of skin",2
"Looks like OP may be the idiot.","Yep!",2
"When can we start pepper spraying the you know what out of these idiots?","I mean, the anti-maskers I’ve come across are also heavily into “self defence”, so it would be hypocritical of them to complain if and when someone does...",2
"As much as I want to knock a few out your health is more of a priority. Mental and physical. I tried that route before but the arguing, the anger, the frustration. It’s too mentally damaging.","True and they don’t even realize they’re wrong",2
"To ""right or wrong"", society needs to remain healthy in order for it to continue to function well. Thus, if someone is unwilling to help protect a society it is under no obligation to provide any benefits to that person.

We evolved empathy to help protect each other, which is why we developed societies in the first place. Eschewing that empathy means you are not willing to work with the society.

Also, for disability they have to provide ""reasonable accommodations"". That depends on a lot of factors, and offering curbside or delivery is a ""reasonable accommodation"" for people who are infected or possibly infected with any viral contagion.","Can I just say. What a truly excellent post. Very well said. And I’m not trying to be sarcastic. What you said is truly fantastic. Sadly, when it comes to anti maskers, it’ll fall on deaf ears, but it’s still great",2
"I guess since masks protect everybody, technically they’re correct.","The best kind of correct!!!",2
"It doesn't make me angry, it makes me sad that there are so many stupid people in the world. I just say, let natural selection take care of them. Charles Darwin says ""SHH, I got this.","You hit this perfectly.",2

"Lmao she still thinks that keeping 6 feet of distance indoors of sufficient.

"On that note, I wish people would hurry the hell up and get vaccinated","But Anti-Vaccinationers are going to just lie and say they got it.
