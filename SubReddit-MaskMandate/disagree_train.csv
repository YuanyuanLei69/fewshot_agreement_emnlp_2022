Then there's the delusional moron who had to wear a mask and came back to her car and made a video about ""I feel... DISORIENTED! I'm out of BREATH... "" yadda yadda yadda. I can't tell how much of that is an act.  Some people who are just mildly inconvenienced by steaming glasses and make-up smearing and make a big deal about it are genuinely narcissistic, but certainly not the majority.","But dont you think that something causes this need of acting and feeling of superiority and knowing better than the avarage citizen?",0

Damn that’s insane.","See, this arrogance is what makes you anti maskers so annoying. No where was it stated that the arrows prevent or eliminate the chance of Covid. It’s just another small step to help reduce the likely hood of spreading it. Just like how masks do not stop the virus. They reduce the spread. But your head is so far up your own ass you can’t see or understand that.

What do you think social distancing means? What do you think it’s for? The reason for the arrows is to help maintain social distancing by having people all go in one direction.

Thats kind of the whole point of you dummies. You cry about the economy, so they lift the bar and restraunt restriction. Now you cry about going into a restaurant....wtf","I was hoping, in part, for a reasonable answer to that pessimism I was showing. Im vaccinated, never got covid, and have been careful. I can care less about the economy, ya public health takes precedent. I've been to a restaurant and eaten in maybe twice in the last year. Ya I got bitchy at the end. But since this stuff is open, people are doing it. Covid is infectious. So in reality, with conservatives anti masking, and kids, being kids and socializing, I see a 0.001% chance of us actually killing this virus at this point.",0

There has to be a sense of fairness and equality for who has to wear the masks, and it certainly isn’t hurting the guy to wear a maskAnd it’s not like the beard factor is part of what made the guy in the video not wear a mask.

As vaccine mandates come about, antivaxxers will be limited in where they can go and what they can do. This is just one more limitation, in my opinion.
