"I hope that didn't take all day to think up","I didn’t",1
"So they’re reporting that they assaulted someone?","I hope that they at least did that. Americans are such cowards that we keep letting these people get away with this! I hate to say it but it's true. We can't keep letting anti-masker violence go on!",1
"I’m genuinely asking, does the women have mental disabilities?","Her mom and her both said she’s fine other than anxiety, which is why she can’t wear the masks.",1
"By speaks out, I mean tells them that they should support their son.","Do you happen to have their social media handle?   You know, for research.",1

"I don't understand the comparison? How does any of that make any sense? I can literally feel my brain going numb as if braincells are dying as I read","They are dying.",1

"Nice one. I'll subscribe.","Thank you!!",1
"As your own precaution, consider contacting that gym manager again and request footage from any security cameras that may have caught her snapping pictures of you and your wife. You have a short window to do this before the footage is likely overwritten.","That is a good idea. Thank you",1
"I feel dizzy... I can't read the bottom line lol. ""You're a ...""","I think it says “cunt” but I’m not sure either",1
"That’s it, where is this I’m coming over there with my paint scraper and removing it","A random bus somewhere in Arizona lol",1
"Should I tell him?","What?",1
"It’s not crying over a piece of cloth. It’s businesses being forced to close for good, suicides, more baby booms, social distancing to the point where we don’t even know how to shake hands, it’s sooo much more.","the pandemic has hit everyone hard, and yes, quarantine has exacerbated some mental health issues. we’re going through a global traumatic event. that doesn’t mean that we should just stop social distancing or refuse to wear masks—we need to protect ourselves and each other.",1
"Sorry the sub is called r/NoLockdownsNoMasks","It’s mostly just one guy who posts extremely frequently wtf",1

"I wear one out of a mix of common courtesy and not wanting to be mistaken for a Qcumber.","I have to say, I found your response the most interesting because of how honest it was. The reasoning you gave had more to do with social pressure and tribal signalling than anything evidentiary to the effects of the virus.

Most people don't say the quiet part out loud, but you did.",1
"Well, my uncle died and my aunt was in a coma for three weeks. Guess I can't comment :/","Sorry for your loss :(",1

"Which app were they reviewing? Pokémon Go introduced masks for your avatar last year and I actually thought it was pretty cool.","it's called Worrydolls",1
"Can someone explain the logic behind storing it in a plastic bag?","The plastic has a higher density and lower space between atoms, so this way the viruses, dust wont enter the bag",1
"God gave us all one.","I mean yeah but that didn’t help the whole people dying from it",1
"sorry Jesus no can help you now, he is in Quarantine","I don’t know what version of the constitution she is beta testing but private property is not public property. LOL. So many lawyers must be making bank from morons like this.",1

"Monoxide and dioxide are two different things. And they call us the sheep? I don’t get humans anymore","Reject humanity, return to Monke",1
"I thought these were people all about personal freedoms.... like if you want to wear a mask you should get to fucking wear a mask. Fuck her and people like that. It's not like you said anything to her.","I am not entirely sure why she called the police and made up a lie that I was taking a inappropriate photo… but it is becoming a bit too much …",1
"I've seen so many of those -- comparisons to the holocaust. And they're so fucking offensive.","It's because Vera Shara, a Holocaust survivor and former editor with New England Journal of Medicine, gave an interview on the subject. She's also the founder of the is the founder of the Alliance for Human Research Protection which came about as a result of her experiences in the concentration camps.",1
"You gotta be a real piece of shit to do something like this, like fucked in the head. She doesn’t come off like a liar at all in the interview, which is weird because the razor is right on the back of the poster and she cut the palm of her hand. Like how the hell did she pull that off. She sounds like she was terrified when she first realized she got cut. She’s getting tested for HIV but HIV doesn’t last long outside the body at all, so she shouldn’t get that at least.","It’s possible the razor got her when she tried to crumple it or something",1
"What does “Fully vaccinated” mean to you? When did you get your vaccines and which kind? What’s your actual stance on masks? Are you for them, against them, or do you wear them to just shut people up?

Not looking to start an argument or come off as rude in anyway. Just asking some clarification questions.

I have my own opinion on masks and their use.","Had two doses of Pfizer and two weeks have passed.

I wore the masks (doubled up when I didn't have to talk much) to try and lower the odds of me spreading anything to others. I did not wear them as any kind of statement and was actually pretty flabbergasted when I realized there was a serious anti mask movement. I had assumed it was just a fringe conspiracy theory thing like chem trails, lizard people, fake moon landings, and flat earth.",1
"I could use that for fencing or airsoft","It looks like it's a remade airsoft mask.",1
"How can a government be a Nazi and a communist at the same time - I mean how many hours of the weird part of the internet is needed to get to this conclusion ?","Wearing a mask or getting a vaccine shouldn't even be political. You don't really even need to know history to know that wearing a mask and getting a vaccine is meant to decrease the number of infected. These people are like a different breed.",1
"Anti-masker here. The reasons are simple. I don't believe they work. If I am not sick, then I will not wear a mask. I find it hard to breathe, and I get severe headaches when I wear it. At the beginning of this all, I had no clue what was going on, so I wore my mask everywhere. That is when I caught Covid. My grandparents were wearing their RELIGIOUSLY, and they caught it. Now that I know more, why in the world would I wear something that makes me feel ill/obstruct my breathing for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate? Plus, I trust God over everything. If He wants me to get it, I will get it. If He wants you to get it, you will get it. That is my opinion, I respect yours, so respect mine.","Thank you for posting your point of view. And I truly appreciate you taking the time to help me understand. :)",1
"Yep, these assholes are operating in my area. SOBs need to die from Covid ASAP.","So sorry to hear that. ABC 7 covered the story last night, totally blasting this group.",1

"Sorry for your loss","Thank you",1
"And just why was no one helping him?","The other employees most definitely would’ve been fired by the company, and the other customers are just raging cunts.",1
"It's funny seeing people rip off their masks as soon they get out of buildings. But at least they wear them lol","I do it because I don't like the heat trapped inside the mask. Of course I usually wait until I'm in my vehicle and leaving a building..",1
"It’s an impressive image. Too bad the message is such bullshit.","Agreed but something tells me despite how it seems like it was made for this post it might have been made for something different but chopped up and reposted on Facebook with this font. Then again maybe I am just expect that behavior from fb/Instagram now.",1
"If you had COVID you are basically in the same spot as a fully vaccinated person if you still have antibodies. Reinfection after having COVID while possible is not common and only a handful of non anecdotal cases have been found worldwide (ignore Brazil and India basically, they way over estimated their infections in the first wave)","i got it in about may of last year",1
"Yes. There's no long-term data on effectiveness of vaccines, how long the protection lasts, and whether or not they're effective for the new variants that are surfacing as the rest of the planet continues to get ravaged.

I wear my mask in public as a reminder to myself and others to maintain social distancing and practice basic common sense hygiene. My wife is immunocompromised, and I don't want to be the one that brings a new superbug home that ends up killing her.","There’s also no long term data on side effects.",1
"I'll weigh in.OBVIOUSLY I should forfeit any medical care, especially for Covid-19. (Especially as I am in Canada and some health care is ""free"".)I mean, I consider it very overblown, if not a hoax, and I don't wear a mask, or take any of the regulations seriously.It would be INCOMPREHENSIBLY hypocritical for me to turn around and accept treatment for covid, if it turns out it is more dangerous than I think.I think you'll find most anti's feel the way I do.So no, not a crazy idea. In fact, it's pretty sensible.","Would you be willing to share why you feel that way (about it being a hoax)? No judgement, just curious, as I believe it's good to have discussions with people who have different views then my own, to understand where they're coming from (disclaimer, I am not an anti-masker and believe the science)",1
"Why are some of the letters in the headline capitalized for no reason?","It’s a way of typing meant to show a sarcastic tone-where the tone of your voice goes up and down drastically.",1
"Prepare to get antimask comments at some point lol","I wonder why reddit won't do their small part and just get rid of r/NoNewNormal and the other anti-mask/covid is a hoax places.",1
"Terry Funk back from retirement... Again. As is tradition.","He must be in a high risk age group so hopefully taking his branding iron to the shops for those anti maskers",1
"Wait Am I supposed to feel good about a guy explaining how to breathe easier in a mask or feel bad because some idiot posted it and called it lies","if you look at my flair then you will understand",1
"taking a photo of someone to do reverse image search is not a thing","I learned that … I couldn’t … google lens didn’t work well but now she is in police report, it would be just fine",1
"What a piece of shit. Just because you believe some antimask propaganda doesn't mean you gotta be a dick or violent. Even if you don't think you need a mask just wear it for the sake of OTHERS.","Well… you’re half right. My problem is that violent anti maskers like him give us all a bad name. There are many of us who in fact want no trouble whatsoever. If people ask me to leave, I do. I don’t yell or curse I just go. Other places will want my business. But no, I’m not doing something I don’t believe in just to satisfy you.",1
"If the woman is the one who made the image, she absolutely needs serious help.   If she's not, she still needs serious help asking with whoever made the image.","My guess is that the woman made the image. She's trying to look fearful but still has this crazed aggression in her eyes.",1
"Have you seen a doctor?  You're sick.","Yes I had a primary care doctor.  And thank you  for asking! I'm completely health. Thanks! I hope you have a wonderful day!",1
"Wow. I bet she thought she was so cool with that last ""for the people/ by the people"" line","She isn’t the only idiot there who thought it was cool.",1
"I really want to know their thought process for places with low Covid rates but a high black population","Hed tell you but ""well... do your homework""Aka ""I'm racist and have nothing to back this up, but totes believe me""",1
"Can someone explain what happened here?","Painter or ceramic worker? I'm not sure, but there are professions that need heavy duty masks that need to be strapped onto your head. Those mask can leave marks.",1
"Got mine yesterday with my son.","Congratulations and thank you to both of you. You must be breathing a little easier today.",1
"I’m with you. I was at a restaurant this weekend with a group of fully immunized adults (including myself). The servers were wearing masks but patrons seated at tables obviously were not. At one point I excused myself to make a restroom visit and it wasn’t until I returned that I realized I had walked through the restaurant without my mask. I was absolutely horrified at myself. Nobody looked twice at me or said anything, but I still felt ashamed.","Ngl, the one thing I'm really looking forward to is using a public bathroom without a mask",1

"I don't know what a digital tattoo is but it sounds awesome.","It's what idiots think will track them when I guess their phone battery dies.",1

"Best post on reddit I’ve seen today, finally someone put how I feel into words lol","Which part?",1
"This is what decades of the GOP keeping their supporters fucking stupid as rocks results in: complete science illiterate morons.","What do you mean?",1
"I think I will up charge all my customers from Texas for being from Texas - no doubt they'll understand.","Don’t you wish that wasn’t illegal discrimination? Let me tell you. I was at the Chargers v cowboys game yesterday and almost nobody on the cowboys side had a mask on. 70,000 people in a somewhat open air arena.",1
"Assholes I can’t wait till the government makes us get vaccine tattoos on our foreheads. So we can so who the anti-vaccinationers are.","Because of the world we currently live in, I honestly don’t know if this is sarcasm or not.",1
"Is this even allowed???","Is against rules but if no one stops it or speaks up, it is ""allowed.""",1
"I never understood why masks=Democrats and Republicans =no masks... disclaimer, I'm Canadian, but I'm a Conservative, and believe that if I lived in the States I'd be a Republican. And I'm very pro science. Masks and vaccines all the way!","It's because the Republican party these days don't have any substantial policy.

"The maskholes are always desperately reaching with the reverse day fantasies. Nice try maskholes","Are you only focused on spreading COVID or is any form of poisoning cool in the new no new crowd? Genuinely curious question. No hate, just truth please.",1
"Bruh what does that say","Wearing mask like this is like wearing underwear like this",1
