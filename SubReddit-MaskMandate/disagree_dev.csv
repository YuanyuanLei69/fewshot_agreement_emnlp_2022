It’s the water droplets that carry the virus. When you breathe, cough, sneeze etc water droplets are expelled through you mouth/nose.

"Stay home if you're scared of getting sick and let the world live on.","It’s not about just personal fear of getting sick, it’s the possibility that you’ll spread sickness to others.

How can you ignore all the footage of exhausted health care workers asking people to wear masks?",0
"I never used a mask in the first place","And is there a reason why not?",0
"I don’t think it’s necessarily just anti-mask people spreading it. Just the act of going outside the house, mask or not, risks the spread. Everybody just wants to do what you want to, have some sort of normal life. Go to the grocery store, buy a candle, eat at a restaurant. It may be that people have been stuck inside for so long that they’ve finally left the house and cases are going up bc it’s colder and people are doing indoor activities. I don’t think you can blame it all on anti mask people bc all the health organizations say to wear a mask to slow the spread, not stop it. Even in the countries with really strict punishments are seeing rises in cases. So those that refuse to wear one certainly aren’t helping but a hell of a lot are and it’s still getting worse","Hmmm. Who to blame. Someone who is trying their best to lessen the spread of Covid or someone flat out denying it exists and doing everything they can to cause problems. Such a tough choice.",0

I guess you don’t need a mask when you have your head shoved far up your ass. No droplets are getting out that’s way.",0
"I really hate how they keep using the ""it doesn't kill most people it infects"" argument. The masks are to stop spreading it cause many people are in serious risk of being killed by it. The lack of empathy scares me so much.","At the begining of the pandemic it was ""im young and healthy, why should i care?""

"The reason this virus has continued to spread is because the masks give people a false security causing them to get into situations they normally wouldn't have","I think this is very untrue.

I'm obese and I am not an anti-masker. We aren't all terrible.",0
"Are any of you going to force anyone to wear one? If not; you’re all talk.","I'm simply asking why they are they way they are.",0
"The whole point of a mask is to not get other people sick. You can eat yourself to death all you want. You eating 12 cheeseburgers a day is not going to kill my parents. Not wearing a mask might.","Masks don’t stop other people from getting sick unless they are N95 or better. The regular medical masks were originally designed to stop bacteria (which you can see under a $20 microscope) from spreading during surgery. Pieces of cloth don’t stop a virus you need an electron microscope to see. That is ridiculous. The CDC just did a study that shows cloth masks at maybe 10% effective. The margin of error was +- 5%.",0

"Looks more like all of you complaining about people not wearing a mask haha mind your own business get back to work people","Yeah but I’d rather not risk my life going to work. And before you pull out the “99.7% survival rate.” That is completely false. The death rate is nearly 2.2%.

I see too much pepole here misread the subbreddit description and think WE ARE anti-maskers when we are not.","I know where I’m posting. The problem with what you’re suggesting is that by doing that I would be getting a different kind of response altogether (biased towards the other side). I am interested in the point of view of those who believe in masks. Hence why I’m posting here. Hope that makes sense. And I think this is an important question both sides should be asking.For further reading check “confirmation bias”.",0

"I have followed masks to the bare minimum in NY, now that the mandate is gone and I'm fully vaccinated: no more any business who requires one for everyone is not getting my business. I'm actually going to have fun tomorrow, I'll be going to several stores and see how many are complying with masks still or if stores are actively enforcing them and noting the places to avoid","See. You’re a prick. Vaccines just became available to everyone like 2 weeks ago. The cdc made that statement like a week ago. Plus. It’s a statement. It’s not eliminating all mask restrictions or anything. It’s a business requires ___ to enter them just shut up and follow it.

You don’t own it. You don’t get to dictate everything, and until covid is 100% control. There is zero issue with wearing a mask.

All you do when you act like that is treat someone like shit when they already being treated like shit. You are a menace and a problem. You are not a freedom fighter. You are not helping anything.

"As I currently understand it, until we get to R=0 on a community level, the precautionary principle applies. Variants can happen every time a new person is infected, so until we get the majority of the population vaccinated, it’s better to not contribute to the possibility of new mutations - otherwise we will need to mask and distance a lot longer should these variants evolve around the existing vaccines.","We will never ever get to R=0. You people are not realistic",0
"It’s true though?Your health is not my responsibility.","why does it need to be explained to you that public health is everyone’s responsibility and it is our job to protect those who cannot do things like vaccinate and wear masks for legitimate health reasons, huh? google is free. look up herd immunity and call me back when you decide to stop being a selfish asshole.",0

"Karen became the most powerful woman in the store when the sheep went along with this mask hoax. The fact is, masks spread it, because hardly anyone uses them correctly.

Karen will be depressed when the mask mandates go away, she will lose her powers over others that do not agree with her. She was already a sad, unhappy pathetic person, the mask made her superior and powerful. When the mask mandate goes away, she will go back to her pathetic, useless life, just like all you other pathetic unhappy mask Nazis.","I'm pretty sure she's just a reasonable human doing her job enforcing rules from a company that she has absolutely no hand in creating. I'm also sure that this situation is not something she ever would have wanted or would ever want to repeat. People like the guy in this video and you are only making people like hers lives harder for absolutely no reason. The store policy is you have to wear a mask so either put on a fucking mask or stay the fuck away. Also I suggest you do maybe even 10 seconds of research on actual scientific studies rather than regurgitating bullshit fox News takes, the idea that wearing masks spreads covid is maybe the dumbest thing I've ever heard and I would think an 8 year old would be too smart to fall for it.",0
"Also is there any proof of anyone being saved from contracting covid directly by the use of a mask?","Sure, How do you think we’ll give you said proof?

"Are you joking? I’m in a science subfield, experimental science very clearly points to wearing masks. There are a variety of studies that all point to the same thing.. don’t hijack science to use for your opinion.

"We'll wear them till everyone, or at least the majority of the people have been vaccinated. Just because you're vaccinated, doesn't mean you can't still catch the virus. You won't be affected by it, but you can still spread it, and potentially kill someone unfortunate enough not to have been vaccinated. With a mask, the risk is lowered significantly.","Then we're going to be wearing them forever. There's no way we're getting even the majority of people vaccinated. It's not going to fucking happen. Especially since you have to get it every fucking year maybe even twice a year. Be realistic and stop being a coward. Were you the scared of the flu?

These are facts","Just spent a hour in the car with a family member that tested positive and almost ended up in the hospital. This was three weeks ago. They are back to work. We never got it, tested negative. We all wore masks. Oh and harsh flu? 5 other family members had it, they all had your opinion of it too. One is dead, one was in the hospital, all 5 out of work for weeks. Never had something effect our family like this. These are facts.",0
"People say masks and social distancing stopped the flu but also say covid is still around because people won’t wear masks and social distance. So does it work or not","It works.

"Obviously your kid isn't too mature if he follows what ever the scientist and government says blindly. Let me make it clear. I dont hate you. Let's get that all out of the way. I just want more Americans to be skeptical instead of taking a steadfast vaccine, with no second thought. Also I dont support either of the 2021 presidential candidates (I wish Tulsi Gabbard got in). Anyways the #1 thing I want is for us to stop being so divided. We are all Americans and the political parties and this whole virus has caused the most division ever. You've got to wonder at some point how many people is this virus actually killing?","He doesn’t even follow what I say blindly. He’s a toddler so I don’t think he really understands what science and the government are. As for me I don’t just blindly trust that masks are the answer or even very effective. I just think since it’s not a big deal we may as well try to slow the spread of the virus by wearing them. Same reason I wear a seatbelt. I don’t blindly trust that the seatbelt will guarantee my safety in the event of a crash but it will probably help and it costs me nothing to wear it.",0
