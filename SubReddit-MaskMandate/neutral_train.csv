If she were to use the argument in court of ""It is a public building so they can't tell me what to do"" it is easily countered by the fact that it is technically a private business that is operating in a public setting. It is the reason why stores can deny you from returning to premises.

DeSade decided he needed yet another fucking mouth mold (to add to the 900 other molds I guess). Point I’m trying to make is that I don’t think people understand how truly horrific being intubated is. My understanding is that they have to keep a lot of people under deep medical sedation, which brings its own risks - the longer they’re under &amp; intubated, the less likely they are to have a good outcome.","Wow I’m glad you’re ok this was just a mask that goes over his mouth and nose and had vapor meds in it I can’t for the life of me remember what it’s called but he had to do it 3 times a day and cried every time luckily he seems to be on the upswing and we only had to do it once today",1

I haven’t done much research because quite frankly I don’t have the time (honesty is my best policy, I’m not gonna bullshit to push my opinion) but as far as I know, some of the other strains floating around are slightly less dangerous/life threatening.

Im not sure if the other strains are weaker but that does seem like a decent answer. Its just stuff like that really makes the virus seem overhyped in some sense.

I don’t think the world should be to mask or not to mask, I obviously wear one at work, but because I’m vaccinated from the one strain (and possibly smaller similarly copied variants) I don’t mask up at the grocery store. I still hug my fiancé’s grandparents goodbye but I keep my mask on while I’m with my elderly residents at the nursing home I work at.

"This is a satirical subreddit. Read the about.","Well, for a reason, I had so much rage in me that I wanted to make a reddit post asap.

I don't put it down tho. Perhaps an anti-masker is looking for a sub like I thought this was and reading this post.",1
"Ugh, these videos are so silly. I was really hoping it was a pro conspiracy theory video, that's where the entertainment is. Watching people debunk total nonsense with a dead serious effort is quite unnecessary. I swear there's more videos of people debunking than people bunking, and I just want to know why. If it's so obvious, if it's so laughable, then why not just sit back and laugh? These ""Why flat Earthers are wrong"" videos are like wow really, ya think?","A video like that would be taken down within 10 seconds lmao.",1
"Could be me but all that mask wearing and hand washing probably kept the flu numbers down, amongst other things.","They're literally arguing against themselves when they say that.",1
"I honestly find that both sides can be pretty aggressive and nasty if you don’t agree with them. Sorry you had to deal with that.","From what I saw there's definitely some on both sides but from what I've seen it's not even close when you consider the level of aggression. The comments against them have typically been against their tactics but from the anti-mask/vax side they're trying to hurt businesses and coordinate against individuals.",1
"this man literally doesn’t look real. he‘s like a rapidly melting wax sculpture.","He looks like my former neighbour, like uncannily similar",1
"didn't god kill just short of 25 million people and satin killed 10?","God made those people die of natural causes so he wouldn't be caught when he goes to court.",1

"This subreddit is satire. We think antimaskers are dumb. You’re a little confused, but you got the spirit.","Ah thanks. That is a fault on my side.",1
"You can refuse service for any reason. I’d be real quick to tell her to get the fuck out","As long as you're not discriminating against a protected class, yes. In this case, the people with the camera are clearly not adhering to company policy. They're jackasses.",1
"Why weren't we wearing masks during previous deadly flu viruses i.e. swine, SARS, bird flu?","In Asia a lot of people did wear masks during sars. And also due to SARS they were more sensible when covid started and they all started wearing masks more quickly",1
"Big hugs to you and your family i wish you the best","Thanks",1
"wtf?! why did target give up? this is not okay!","Im sure PD was contacted to get them escorted out of the store.",1
"Anti-masker here, I'll tell you how I could be convinced to wear a mask, if you are interested.For starters, it's not about if, in the abstract, masks work or not. After all, surgeons have been wearing masks for a long time, and plague doctors wore masks centuries ago. It's about convincing us that the current situation warrants them. After all, flu season has existed for a long time, and no one thought to turn off the economy or muzzle the population until now. And the fact is, if it was not for the constant news bombardment about this thing, I would literally be unaware there was a pandemic going on. I expect your friend is the same; start by convincing him that Covid is a serious enough thing to warrant a mask. This will probably be the most difficult step.Also, and this part I cannot emphasize enough, DO NOT GASLIGHT. Acknowledge that it is horrible, and will suck, but convince him that it is less horrible, and will suck less, than the consequences of not wearing a mask. But this barrage of people saying ""It's not a big deal"" and ""It's just a thin piece of cloth"" comes across as disingenuous and an attempt to trick us. This is not a good tactic.On a related note, calling him an ""evil grandma-killing sociopath"" or ""stupid"" will also not change his mind. It will only vindicate him.Finally, convince him that it will, in fact, be temporary. This will be difficult since you are not the person making the law, but as an anti-masker, Covidskeptical person, who has read a book before, I have little faith that these ""temporary measures"" are in fact temporary, leading me to resent them. If I could be certain of an end date for mask bylaws, I would be more likely to comply with them.Good luck to you.","I really don't need to convice him that covid is a dangetous disease. I live in the Netherlands and we where on a huge lockdown here back in march-july. But thanks for the tips. I'm going to combine all the tips i got to get maybe convice some people that these masks are safe.",1

"Is everyone involved in this subreddit just a complete clown? Am I supposed to take this seriously or something?","Well, the featured anti-maskers sure are complete clowns... as for 'taking the sub seriously' I'm not sure what you mean.

These anti-maskers sure do exist, and we've got the documentation to show how idiotic they are... but I sure wouldn't start listening to the anti-maskers if I were you.
But, you know, it's your choice and all that, I suppose.",1

"I can't tell what this is, help","In order to get around a local school mask mandate, this parent made masks from tulle/netting. Basically, they are using their kids to make their point that masks don’t work and shirk the rules.",1

"Well fuck that guy...But you guys should be proud...me and my boyfriend shamed a couple assholes into putting masks on. Lol we walked out an isle in the grocery and there they were no masks less than 6 feet away from us...so I was all like 'eww gross' and moved back from them and my boyfriend ended up telling them they were trash. A little later I saw the same two women but they had masks on now. I mean one part of me feels a little bad because we were for sure being assholes about it, but they were being assholes for coming in the store with no masks on and putting us at risk(we haven't got vaccinated yet you see).","1. It doesn't count as being an asshole if you force them to use a mask.2. That guy is wearing a mask. He tricked the other people into thinking his mask wasn't up when it was a very realistic looking mask.",1
"First, there are no constitutional laws *mandating mask wearing*Second, nobody is telling you not to wear your mask. If masks work then you will be safe. If masks don't work, then keep your distance from anyone without a mask. If masks and social distancing don't work, then go get your vaccine. If all three dont work, what's the use of trying to avoid it. You're going to die of worry sooner than anything. Hypochondriac.","Constitutional laws of the United States don't apply to all countries but common sense should be pretty universal",1
"Hold on... what doctors are saying this? Jesus Christ I hate anti-vaccinationers","I haven't found any doctors saying it, but around April I was encountering a troubling amount of nurses and staff at medical facilities who were eligible for a vaccine but didn't have plans to get it any time soon. So yeah, you can find people ostensibly employed in medicine who are anti-vax. Obviously they're not experts though. :/",1

"I still love the fact that the comments were calling her out during the stream","It was about half and half tbh. The folks calling her out were mostly the person holding the clipboard's friends - and that's the person whos fighting cancer.

"why does this kinda look photoshopped","I don't know but I assure you it isn't from what else he has on his feed",1
"Eh, this simply isn't true, as worded. Wearing a mask is uncomfortable in multiple ways. There's a huge difference between ""totally worth it"" and ""no reason not to wear it"". I'm getting a little tired of hearing anti-anti-maskers acting like masks are so unbothersome that they might just wear them for fun after this is all over. You're accidentally making a moot and false argument that masks are super comfortable and not even the slightest bit restrictive (as if comfort is what should define you wearing it), instead of the important argument that they're worth wearing. So an anti-masker could technically say this is dumb and wrong, and they'd be right. And if an anti-masker is right, you said something wrong.","Uncomfortable yes, worth throwing a fit over? No.",1

"The original virus may have 99.98 survival rate, but people like this increase the variant rate. So yeah evolution is proven again, potential at the cost of a lot of people.","The survival rate of the virus is more like 98%; in other words, about one in 50 people die of it.

Notice how the Covidiots love to use the survival rate instead of the mortality rate because it sounds better. Kind of like ""95% fat free"" sounds better than ""5% fat"".",1
